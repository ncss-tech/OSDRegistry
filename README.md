Version control repository for [Official Series Descriptions](https://soilseries.sc.egov.usda.gov/) (OSDs). 

Official "Soil Series" are detailed soil types used by the USDA-NRCS and the National Cooperative Soil Survey program. The Soil Series is the lowest level in the U.S. Soil Taxonomic system. Series are further subdivided into components and phases based on specific conditions within soil survey areas (SSA) and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs).

Key differentia between series are encoded in the narrative portions of OSDs. OSDRegistry provides a readily-accessible, open-source, version-controlled resource for Series concepts in OSDs.
