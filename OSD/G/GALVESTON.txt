GALVESTON SERIES

The Galveston series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable soils) that formed in sandy eolian deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils occur on back-barrier flats on barrier islands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils are occasionally flooded with salt water during severe storms.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

Brazosport soils: sodic throughout and wetter; on a lower landscape
Drumbay soils: are somewhat poorly drained: on similar landform but lower water receiving areas
Nass soils: in depressions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Somewhat excessively drained (water enters these soils rapidly and drain to the permanent water table)
Runoff: very low.  Internal drainage is rapid above the water table.  Permeability is rapid.  A water table is at depths of 76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 in) in normal years.  Following storms or very high tides the water table approaches the surface for a period of a few days in some areas.  These soils are occasionally inundated with salt water during cyclonic storms.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: Mostly native rangeland, wildlife habitat and recreation
Native vegetation: mainly bunch grasses such as switchgrass, seacoast bluestem, sea-oats, common reedgrass, and gulfdune paspalum, and soilbind morninglory.  Some areas have clumps of sweetbay, redbay, and dwarf live oak trees.
