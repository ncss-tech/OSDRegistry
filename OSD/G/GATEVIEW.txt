GATEVIEW SERIES

The Gateview series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvial or colluvial material from sedimentary rocks and glacial materials of mixed origin.  Gateview soils are on outwash terraces, toeslopes, alluvial fans, till plains, kames, esters, mountains, and low ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gateview gravelly loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 15 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobble; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    A2--10 to 22 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; 50 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

    C--22 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; 50 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobble; neutral.  (Several feet thick)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Parent material:  alluvium or colluvium from sedimentary rocks and glacial materials
Landform:  outwash terraces, alluvial fans, till plains, hillslopes, kames, and eskers
Slopes:  2 to 45 percent
Elevation:  7,600 to 10,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  34 to 40 degrees F
Mean summer temperature:  58 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  18 to 33 inches
Precipitation pattern:  peak periods during winter and least amounts in May and June
Frost-free period:  40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tine and Pierian soils.  Both have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick and have sandy-skeletal lower sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly as native pastureland; however, they may be irrigated to hay crops in places.  Principal native vegetation is Thurber fescue, big sage, native bluegrass and scattered aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountain valleys of central and western Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent.
