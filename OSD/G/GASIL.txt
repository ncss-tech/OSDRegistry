GASIL SERIES

The Gasil series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in deeply weathered loamy residuum derived from sandstones. These soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).
