GOODBYE SERIES

The Goodbye series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Goodbye soils are on river and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series recognized in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goodbye soils are on river on stream terraces. They occur on summit positions. Goodbye soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rock sources.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Eastwalker series.  Eastwalker soils have an aquic soil moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 75 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for very brief or brief periods between December and September.

USE AND VEGETATION: Goodbye soils are used for pastureland, watershed and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly rushes, sedges, bluegrass, clover and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
