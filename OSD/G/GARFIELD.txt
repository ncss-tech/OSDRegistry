GARFIELD SERIES

The Garfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess. These soils are on ridgetops and loess hills. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Garfield silty clay loam - cultivated. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bt1--8 to 27 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic parting to strong fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and many medium pores; faint continuous clay films on faces of peds; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) manganese coatings on faces of peds; common fine iron-manganese concretions; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 25 inches thick)  

    Bt2--27 to 48 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic parting to strong fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores and many medium tubular pores; faint continuous clay films on faces of peds; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; manganese coatings on faces of peds; common fine iron-manganese concretions; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (18 to 22 inches thick) 

    Bt3--48 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic parting to strong fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; faint continuous clay films on faces of peds; few very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist manganese coatings on faces of peds; few fine iron-manganese concretions; neutral (pH 6.6).

Btb horizons present in some pedons 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Monita and Secca series. The Monita soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock. Secca soils have 2 to 30 percent coarse fragments in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur at elevations of 1,900 to 3,000 feet on ridgetops and loess hills on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. These soils formed in pre-Bull-Lake loess, with mixture of post Pinedale loess in the surface layer.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation of 18 to 25 inches. The mean January temperature is 28 degrees F., mean July temperature is 68 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caldwell, Latah, Naff, Palouse, Tilma, and Thatuna soils. Caldwell soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick, are somewhat poorly drained, and are in drainageways. Latah and Tilma soils have mollic epipedons, an albic horizon above the argillic horizon and are in drainageways. Palouse and Thatuna soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and are on loess hills. Naff soils have a mollic epipedon, are fine-silty and are on loess hills. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for production of small grains, peas, and lentils and for legume grass for hay. Native vegetation consists of Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, arrowleaf balsamroot, western yarrow, phlox, and wild rose brush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Throughout the eastern part of Whitman and Spokane Counties, in Washington; Benewah, Nez Perce, and Latah Counties in Idaho. Series is of moderate extent. MLRA 9

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Whitman County, Washington, 1942. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:

Ochric epipedon (mollic subgroup feature) - the zone from 0 to 8 inches meeting all criteria for a mollic epipedon except depth (Ap horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 8 to 28 inches (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)

The classification of this seies has been revised as of 5/00 with the addition of a superactive CEC activity class based on revision of Soil Taxonomy.
