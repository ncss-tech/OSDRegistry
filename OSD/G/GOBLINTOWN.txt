MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Franklin County, Virginia, 2004.

REMARKS: Goblintown soils were previously mapped as inclusions in Littlejoe, Buffstat, and Bugley soils. Levels of total carbon are high due to the influence of graphitic parent materials; however organic matter from plant residue is thought to be similar to adjacent soils.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 20 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)
Paralithic contact--bedrock contact at 37 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)
Paralithic Materials--the zone from 37 to 80 inches (Cr layer)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 47 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (Lab Pedon Number: 99P0442; User Pedon ID: 99VA141005).
