GRANILE SERIES

The Granile series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and hills. These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived principally from gneiss, schist, and granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Granile gravelly sandy loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch slightly decomposed bark, needles, twigs and leaves.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    E--1 to 10 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    E/B--10 to 19 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2), brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist (E); brown (7.5YR 5/4) brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist (Bt) very gravelly sandy clay loam (composite texture), weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; faint patchy clay films on some ped faces and in some root channels and pores; this horizon consists of clayey material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a matrix like that of the overlying horizon; 40 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick.)

    Bt--19 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; faint nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds and in root channels and pores; 60 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 22 inches thick)

    BCt--35 to 42 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; faint patchy clay films on some faces of peds and in some root channels and pores; 70 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    C--42 to 61 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 70 percent gravel; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gambler, Hollandlake, Kurrie, Larand,  Leadville, Tolvar series. Gambler and Kurrie soils  have bedrock at depths of less than 60 inches.  Hollandlake soils have a udic moisture regime.  Larand soils have sandy-skeletal 2C horizons.  Leadville soils have hue of 5YR in a major part of the solum and C horizon. Tolvar soils have a large percentage of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand in the fine earth, and have "hard setting" properties when dry. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Granile soils are on mountain slopes and hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived principally from gneiss, schist, and granitic rocks.  Elevation is 8,000 to 10,000 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches with a peak period of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is about 50 degrees F. The frost free period is 20 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Leadville and Troutville soils. Leadville soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Troutville soils have argillic horizons consisting of lamellae.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as native pastureland, for forestry, and for recreation. Native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and a moderate understory of grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountain areas of central and southeastern Colorado and south central Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.
