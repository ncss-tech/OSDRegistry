GENERALGRANT SERIES

The Generalgrant series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum derived from granite. The Generalgrant soils are on stream terraces and drainageways on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1050 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Azalea, Cabincove, and Tharpslog soils. The Azalea soils are on convex shoulders and backslopes of mountain slopes and have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. The Cabincove soils are on linear to convex backslopes of mountain slopes and have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. The Tharpslog soils are on broadly concave backslopes of mountain slopes and are somewhat excessively drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Generalgrant soils are on concave footslopes of stream terraces and drainageways on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum weathered from granite. Elevation is 1385 to 2505 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 885 to 1170 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free season is 105 to 200 days.
