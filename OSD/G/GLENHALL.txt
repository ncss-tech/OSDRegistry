GLENHALL SERIES

The Glenhall series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash. Glenhall soils are on outwash plains and on till plains which have a layer of outwash. Slope ranges from 1 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Mollic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Glenhall silt loam, on a 2 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 223 meters (730 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; mixing of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) subsoil; weak medium granular structure; friable; many very fine roots; 1 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bt1--20 to 43 cm (8 to 17 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine roots; thin discontinuous brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; 3 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--43 to 81 cm (17 to 32 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine roots; thin continuous brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; 6 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt3--81 to 109 cm (32 to 43 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; thin discontinuous dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; few fine prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 71 to 102 cm (28 to 40 inches).]

 2Bt4--109 to 127 cm (43 to 50 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; thin discontinuous yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) clay bridging between sand grains; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; common fine prominent gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 inches) thick]

 3C--127 to 152 cm (50 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand with strata of sand and silt loam; single grain and massive; loose and friable; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; many medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; cumulative thickness of silty strata is 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 inches); 9 percent gravel; slightly alkaline.

Reaction: moderately acid to neutral depending on liming history

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: typically loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam but ranges to silty clay loam where the thickness of the silty material is near the maximum
Rock fragment content: 0 to 12 percent
Reaction: moderately acid or slightly acid

2Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR
Value: 5
Chroma: 4 or 6

Rock fragment content: 15 to 25 percent
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

3C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: stratified sand to silt loam; textures are dominantly sandy but thin strata of silty and loamy material are included; cumulative thickness of the silty and loamy strata is less than 40 percent of the horizon thickness
Rock fragment content: 3 to 14 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline; carbonates are present in some pedons

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Neda and Octagon series. Neda and Octagon soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glenhall soils are on outwash plains and on till plains which have a layer of outwash. Slope ranges from 1 to 4 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.8 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 207 to 305 meters (680 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the poorly drained Drummer soils, the somewhat poorly drained La Hogue soils, and the moderately well drained Barce and Billett soils. Drummer soils have grayer subsoils and are in depressions and swales. La Hogue soils have redox depletions at shallower depths and are on slightly lower lying rises. Barce soils have the lower part of the solum formed in till and are on similar landscape positions. Billett soils contain more sand in the solum and are on slightly higher lying landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly cropped to corn and soybeans. Small grain is also grown. Native vegetation is mixed forest and prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 110 and 111C in west-central Indiana. The type location is in MLRA 110. The series is of small extent.
