GIVIN SERIES

The Givin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on summits of interfluves, head slopes on dissected till plains, and treads on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).
