GALLATIN SERIES

The Gallatin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on valley bottoms and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gallatin loam, native hay (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common roots; few vesicular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--4 to 14 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine vesicular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A1 and A2 horizons is 14 to 30 inches.)

    AB--14 to 23 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine vesicular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--23 to 28 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few fine vesicular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk--28 to 36 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; many medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) redox concentrations, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium soft masses of lime; strongly effervescent, slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bkg--36 to 60 inches; light gray (5Y 6/1) gravelly clay loam, gray (5Y 5/1) moist; many medium prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) redox concentrations, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium soft masses of lime; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
