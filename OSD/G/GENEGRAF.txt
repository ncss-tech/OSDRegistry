GENEGRAF SERIES 

The Genegraf series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Genegraf soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beoska, Beowawe, Jerval, Nyserva, and Ricert series.

Beoska soils have weak discontinuous cementation and natric horizons with texture of silty clay loam or silt loam.  Beowawe soils have natric horizons with 18 to 25 percent clay and do not have Bqk and Bk horizons with 25 to 50 percent gravel.  Jerval soils have natric horizons with sodium adsorption ratios of 13 to 30 and Bqk horizons with durinodes in a friable matrix.  Nyserva soils have Bqk horizons with durinodes in a friable matrix.  Ricert soils have natric horizons with sodium adsorption ratios of 13 to 45 and are noncalcareous in the upper part.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Genegraf soils are on fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,000 to 1,620 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bluewing, Rednik, and Trocken soils.  Bluewing soils are sandy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons, and do not have natric horizons.  Rednik soils are loamy-skeletal, have argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent fan remnants.  Trocken soils are loamy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons, and do not have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Genegraf soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Bailey's greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are extensive with about 107,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.
