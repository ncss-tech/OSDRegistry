GOODSON SERIES

The Goodson series consists of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium or loess and the underlying residuum weathered from shale or interbedded shale and siltstone on upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Goodson gravelly silt loam on a south-facing, convex, 6 percent slope in pasture at an elevation of 1,075 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 20 percent subrounded chert gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick.)

(5 to 10 inches thick.)

   2Bt2--15 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) and few fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) lithic-chromic mottles; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent subrounded chert gravel; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the 2Bt is 15 to 25 inches.)

   3Bt4--32 to 37 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and gray (10YR 6/1)  silty clay loam; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very firm; few fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent siltstone channers; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

   3Bt5--37 to 44 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) silty clay loam; medium coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds; many medium distinct olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) masses of iron accumulation in ped interiors; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the 3Bt is 12 to 31 inches)

   3Cr--44 to 54 inches; shale-siltstone

TYPE LOCATION:  Polk County, Missouri; about 2 miles north of Huron, Missouri; 2050 feet west and 350 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 33, T. 35N., R. 22W.; USGS Polk quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 44 minutes 6 seconds N. and longitude 93 degrees 21 minutes 55 seconds W..

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 56 to 59 degrees F.
Depth to a paralithic contact and to the base of the argillic horizon is 40 to 60 inches.

A horizon:
     Value: 2 or 3 moist and 3, 4 or 5 dry
     Chroma: 1 to 3
     Fine-earth: silt loam or silty clay loam
     Rock fragments: 5 to 35 percent gravel
     Reaction: neutral to strongly acid

BA and Bt horizons:
     Value: 4 or 5
     Chroma: 3 or 4
     Fine-earth: silt loam, or silty clay loam
     Rock fragments: 0 to 30 percent gravel

2Bt horizon:
     Hue: 2.5YR to 5YR
     Value: 4 to 6
     Chroma: 3 to 8
     Mottles: Hue 2.5YR to 10YR: Value 4 to 6: Chroma 3 to 8
     Fine-earth: silty clay or clay
     Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravel
     Reaction: slightly acid to very strongly acid

3Bt horizon:
Matrix colors in the lower argillic are variable due to the litho-chromic influence of the shale parent material.

     Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent channers
     Reaction: moderately alkaline to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alsup, Losantville, Miamian, Morrisville, Shircliff, Skrainka, and Useful series. Alsup soils do not have mollic colors in the surface layer. Losantville soils have free carbonates at a depth of 8 to 20 inches and are more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact. Miamian soils are more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact and have free carbonates from 18 to 40 inches. Morrisville soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and free carbonates in the lower part of the series control section. Shircliff soils are more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact and have free carbonates from 30 to 60 inches. Skrainka soils do not have mollic colors in the surface layer and are more than 60 inches to a paralithic contact. Useful soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The soils formed in colluvium or loess and the underlying residuum from shale or interbedded shale and siltstone.  Chert fragments are commonly a part of the colluvium. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alsup, Bona, Creldon, Hoberg, Ocie and Viraton soils.  Bona soils are clayey-skeletal, are very deep to a lithic or paralithic contact and are on ridgetops and side slopes above the Goodson soils.  Alsup soils have a light colored surface layer and are on similar positions to the Goodson soils. Creldon and Hoberg soils have a fragipan and are on more level areas above the Goodson soils.  Ocie soils are loamy-skeletal over clayey and are on side slopes below the Goodson soils.  Viraton soils are fine-loamy, have a fragipan and are below the Goodson soils on broad level areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff is medium to high.  Permeability is moderately slow.  In undisturbed areas, a perched water table has an upper limit of 2.5 to 4.0 feet during December to March in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in grasses and legumes.  Some small grain crops are grown on the more gentle slopes.  Native vegetation is tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ozark Border area (MLRA 116B) of southwest Missouri.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Polk County, Missouri, 1995.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 9 inches to 44 inches (Bt, 2Bt abd 3Bt horizons).
Paralithic contact - soft shale-siltstone at 44 to 51 inches (2Cr horizon).

In southwestern Missouri, these soils formed in materials weathered exclusively from shales and siltstones from the Northview formation.
