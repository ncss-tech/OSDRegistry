GILLETT GROVE SERIES

The Gillett Grove series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in 40 to 60 inches of loess overlying glacial till. Gillet Grove soils are on nearly level positions and swales on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Particle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 40 inches 
Mollic epipedon: the zone from the surface to 21 inches (Ap, A1, A2 and AB horizons);
Cambic horizon: the zone from 21 to 57 inches (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and BCg horizons).
Aquic moisture regime.
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
Cation exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Gillett Grove soils were previously included in the Marcus series. Based on MLRA correlation, soils that formed 40 to 60 inches of loess over glacial till will be correlated to this series. Soils that formed more than 60 inches of loess will be correlated to the Marcus series.  This type location was previously the type location for the Marcus series.
