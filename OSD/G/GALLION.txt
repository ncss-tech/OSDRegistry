GALLION SERIES

The Gallion series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on natural levees on alluvial plains, and formed in silty Holocene age alluvium of the Arkansas and Red Rivers. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in).

  Ck--125 to 203 cm (49 to 80 in); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) stratified silt loam and very fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine pores; common fine carbonate concretions; strata are 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) thick; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

SERIES PROPOSED: Bossier Parish, Louisiana; 1959, 

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Dexter series. The series was separated based on base saturation above 60 percent at 125 cm (50 in) below top of argillic and site position.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 75 cm (10 to 30 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (Ap horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 25 to 84 cm (10 to 33 in) (Bt horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 25 to 112 cm (10 to 49 in) (Bt, BC horizons)

Additional Comments: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station laboratory data number S65LA-41-2.
