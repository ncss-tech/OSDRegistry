GAYHART SERIES

The Gayhart series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to soft shale.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shales.  Gayhart soils occur on hillslopes and ridge crests.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gayhart clay loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A--0 to 2 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) heavy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

      AC--2 to 10 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) heavy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

      Ck--10 to 36 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine concretions and crystals of secondary calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 33 inches thick)

      Cr--36 inches; soft, calcareous shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sheridan County, Wyoming; SW1/4, SE1/4, sec. 4, T. 47 N., R. 85 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weakly consolidated shale and the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 145 to 192 days.  The soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section from April 15 to June 15 but are dry in all parts for 60 consecutive days following July 15 and 90 cumulative days from July 15 to October 25.  Texture of the control section is clay or clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay.  Coarse fragments are typically absent but soft shale chips are present in some pedons immediately above the bedrock.

2 - Gayhart Series

The A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
The C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 15 percent.  Calcium sulfate is present in some pedons.  EC ranges from 0 to 8 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bodot, Bone, Gaynor, and Vananda series.  Bodot soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section from April to July 15.  Bone soils contain a thin Btn horizon and contain more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in some part.  Gaynor soils have over 192 days when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more.  Vananda soils are deep.

GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING:  The Gayhart soils are on hillslopes and ridge crests.  These soils formed in fine textured residuum and local alluvium and colluvial slopewash derived from calcareous shale.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The frost-free season is about 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bahl and Samday series.  Bahl soils have deep cracks.  Samday soils are shallow to weakly consolidated bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow or very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Utilized as rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of green needlegrass, Idaho fescue, plains reedgrass, rhizomatous wheatgrass, spike fescue, and perennial forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central and eastern Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.
