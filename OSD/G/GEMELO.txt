GEMELO SERIES

The Gemelo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on fan aprons.  These soils formed in gravelly alluvium derived mainly from tuff of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gemelo soils are on fan aprons at the base of scarps.  These soils formed in gravelly alluvium derived mainly from tuff of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring during July through September.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 210 to 260 days. Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Reduff, Scotal, and Straddlebug soils.  Reduff and Scotal soils are in the loamy-skeletal family, and are shallow to tuffaceous bedrock.  These soils are on erosional hills and mountains in higher landscapes.  Straddlebug soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are on alluvial fan remnants lower in the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Gemelo soils are well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is negligible on slopes of less than 1 percent and very low on 1 to 3 percent.  These soils receive fast-moving overland water flow originating from adjacent hills, mountains, and scarps.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is a desert grassland with scattered creosotebush, mesquite, tarbush, mariola, cacti, and broom snakeweed.  Native grasses include fluffgrass, bush muhly, black grama, blue grama, perennial threeawn, burrograss, and tobosagrass, with scattered alkali sacaton along small channels.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Texas. MLRA 42. Desert Grassland Vegetative Zone.  The soil is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Brewster County, Texas, 1997.  The name is from a mesa west of the type location.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 80 inches (Bn, Bkn, B'n, B'kn, and BCkn horizons)

Sodic feature - SAR from 13 to 35 percent within 40 inches of the surface

Ustic feature - the soil has an aridic moisture regime that borders the ustic moisture regime

Fluventic feature - These soils are assumed to have an irregular decrease in organic carbon content based on stratification from a depth of 10 to 50 inches.  Similar soils in similar geomorphic position have an irregular decrease in organic carbon

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
