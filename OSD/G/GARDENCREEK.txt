GARDENCREEK SERIES 

The Gardencreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Aquic Xerofluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gardencreek silty clay loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots, few coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick) 

    C1--8 to 21 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium roots, few coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 24 inches thick) 

    C2--21 to 24 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard friable slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots and few coarse roots; many fine, few medium tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 10 inches thick) 

    C3--24 to 43 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) silty clay, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick) 

    C4--43 to 60 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) silty clay, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; common fine distinct olive (5Y 5/4) redox concentrations; few very fine and fine tubular pores; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and plastic; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - flood plains in intermountain valleys. 

Elevation - 2,500 to 2,800 feet. 

Slope - 0 to 2 percent. 

Parent material - clayey alluvium. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm dry summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches. 

Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 100 to 120 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gardencreek soils are used as rangeland, pastureland, cropland and wildlife habitat.  The principle crop is irrigated alfalfa.  The potential native vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gardencreek soils are of small extent in the mountain valleys of western Montana. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991. Proposed in Sanders County, Montana, 1987. 

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation records:  MT1111.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (Ap horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (C1, C2, and C3 horizons).  Gardencreek soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime bordering on aridic.
