GREENBRAE SERIES

The Greenbrae series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mostly from granitic rocks.  The Greenbrae soils are on terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Abgese and Ackley soils have less than 27 percent clay in their Bt horizons.  Blacknest soils are 500 to 100 cm to sand and gravel.  Bluelight, Colbar Eusbio, Nosser Sidlake and Stiles soils have bedrock at less than 100 cm.   Hardtrigger soils are 25 to 69 cm to base of Bt and have silica cementation below the Bt.  Harsan soils have duripans within 100 to 150 cm.  Hoosegow soils have Bw horizons above their Bt and have less than 27 percent clay average in their Bt horizons. Hoye and Windypoint soils have secondary carbonates within 50 cm. Lankbush soils have less than 27 percent clay in their Bt horizons. Morfitt soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from argillites, shales and reworked older terrace sediments and are dominated by finer sand particles. Shawave soils have less than 27 percent clay in their Bt horizons and have a mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 13 degrees C. Turria soils are 30 to 50 cm to the base of their Bt horizon and have less than 5 percent medium sand and coarser.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Greenbrae soils are on smooth terraces, alluvial fans and fan remnants at elevations of 1,375 to 1,710 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in loamy alluvium mostly from granodiorite.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aquinas, Deodar, Estive, Haybourne and Indian Creek soils.  Aquinas and Indian Creek soils have duripans above depth of 100 cm.  Deodar soils have and abrupt textural change clay B2t horizon.  Estive soils have mollic epipedons and Bk horizons.  Haybourne soils lack argillic horizons and have sandy loam control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Greenbrae soils are used principally for livestock grazing, recreation and urban development.  Native vegetation is big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, squirreltail and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwest Nevada.  The soils are of small extent.
