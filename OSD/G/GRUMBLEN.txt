GRUMBLEN SERIES

The Grumblen series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Grumblen soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Grumblen very gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones.

(8 to 30 cm thick)

    Btk2--30 to 46 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; secondary carbonates segregated as many fine and medium threads and coats on bottoms of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    R--46 cm; rhyolite; carbonate coats on the bedrock contact.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Burrita, Disage, Jung, Loomis, Pipespring and Rocconda series.

Burrita soils are not calcareous in the lower Bt horizon and have a mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 11 degrees C.  Dishner and Pipespring soils are noncalcareous throughout their profile and lack a Btk with secondary carbonates.  Jung soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. and rock fragments are dominantly cobbles.  Loomis soils lack Btk horizons, are neutral or slightly alkaline throughout and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. Rocconda soils are 10 to 36 cm to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grumblen soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, andesite, and basalt.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Old Camp, Pickup, and Theon soils.  Old Camp soils are loamy-skeletal.  Pickup soils are moderately deep and have mollic epipedons.  Theon soils are loamy-skeletal and have a typic aridic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grumblen soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Lahontan sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, bottlebrush squirreltail, bluegrass, and needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 27.
