SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gloucester County, New Jersey, 2003 

REMARKS: The series is named for the nearby town of Glassboro in Gloucester County, New Jersey. Glassboro soils were formally mapped Dragston soils. Dragston soils are in a thermic family and are Aeric Endoaquults. 

The 6/2006 revision changes status from tentative to established. Measurements were converted to metric and other minor revisions were also made. 

The 5/2008 revision adds horizon features that were missing in the previous description. 

Diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 28 cm (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 66 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Btg horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone below 41 cm that is periodically saturated (endosaturation) 

Other soil features identified in this pedon are:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm (0 to 59 inches) 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Reference particle-size data is available from the project soil survey staff, Hammonton, New Jersey.
