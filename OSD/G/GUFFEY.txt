GUFFEY SERIES

The Guffey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite and granite.  Guffey soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Guffey very gravelly sandy loam - coniferous forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oe--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed organic material, chiefly needles, bark and twigs.

    A--1 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    E--3 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam,  brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt--14 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many thin clay films on faces of peds and rock fragments; 75 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    BC--24 to 31 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 75 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Cr--31 to 41 inches; weakly or moderately cemented, partially weathered granodiorite (grus).

TYPE LOCATION:  Fremont County, Colorado; about 12 miles east of Salida; about 1,400 feet north and 2,400 feet west of the southeast corner of Sec. 17, T. 49 N., R. 11 E.; Howard USGS quad; lat. 38 degrees 29 minutes 44 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees 01 minutes 30 seconds W. (estimated), NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES:
Cadotte (MT), Cundiyo (NM), Fris, Fulvance, Goosepeak (CO), Reinecker -very deep
Cloud Peak (WY), Hyattville (WY), Kimpton (MT), Lake Creek (WY), Lakehelen (WY), Lulude (CO), Laveta, Tepecreek (MT)-have a lithic contact
  
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Guffey soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are typically 5 to 60 percent.  These soils are formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite and granite, commonly of the Pikes Peak  Formation.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 25 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 95 days.  Elevation ranges from 8,000 to 10,900 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Granile, Raleigh, and Rogert soils.  Granile soils lack a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Raleigh soils have a mollic epipedon and a paralithic contact above a depth of 20 inches.  Rogert soils have a mollic epipedon and a lithic contact above a depth of 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to high runoff; permeability is moderately rapid.  Pedons with higher clay approaching 35 percent have moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for woodland and for recreation.  Native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir and a sparse understory of elk sedge, true mountain mahogany, Arizona fescue, kinnikinnick, and common juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountain areas of central Colorado; MLRA 48A.  The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana
