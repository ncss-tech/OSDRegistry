GILISPIE SERIES

The Gilispie series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium or residuum derived from andesite, ryolite or basalt.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gilispie gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots and tubular pores; few skeletons on pebbles; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--3 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots, many fine tubular pores; common skeletons on faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (combined A horizon is 5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt--6 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots and tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    BC--14 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots, few fine pores; 75 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    R--18 inches; hard andesite.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gilispie soils are used mainly as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, big sagebrush, and prairie junegrass.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gilispie soils are of small extent in western Montana, eastern Idaho, Wyoming and Oregon.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County, Montana, 1972.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0571 and MT0660.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon when mixed to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons); an argillic horizon which is the particle-size control section from 6 to 14 inches (Bt horizon); and a lithic contact at 18 inches (R horizon).  Gilispie soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
