GOCHEA SERIES

The Gochea series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and colluvium derived from weathered tuffs, basalt, rhyolite, andesite, and conglomerate with a component of loess.  The Gochea soils are on fan piedmont remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gochea soils are on fan piedmont remnants, stream terraces, and mountain valley fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and colluvium derived from weathered tuffs, basalts, rhyolite, andesite and conglomerate with some influence from loess.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,555 to 2,170 meters. The climate is cool and semiarid with moist winters and dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, average annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Donna and Stampede soils.  Donna soils have very fine textured argillic horizons and indurated duripans.  Stampede soils have fine textured argillic horizons and have indurated duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, cheatgrass and lupine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  MLRA 25.  These soils are not extensive.
