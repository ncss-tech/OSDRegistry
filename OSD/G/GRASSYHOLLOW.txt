GRASSYHOLLOW SERIES

The Grassyhollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum weathered from conglomerate.   These soils are on escarpments and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Grassyhollow very gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 8 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 15 cm thick)

    Btk1--8 to 32 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; 25 percent calcium carbonate masses on bottom of rock fragments and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Btk2--32 to 54 cm; red (2.5YR 4/6) very gravelly clay loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine tubular pores;  5 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; 10 percent calcium carbonate masses throughout and 20 percent calcium carbonate masses on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    R--54 cm; strongly cemented conglomerate bedrock.
