GOLLAHER SERIES

The Gollaher series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone or other strongly calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Gollaher soils are on mountain and hill crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gollaher very gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 50 percent gravel and 5 percent with cobbles.

    A--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; thin continuous carbonate pendants on undersides of gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 13 cm thick)

    Bk--5 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; thick continuous carbonate pendants on undersides of gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).  Abrupt smooth boundary (3 to 15 cm thick)

    R--15 cm; limestone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; about 11 miles southwest of Jackpot, Nevada near Mahogany Basin; about 700 feet east and 1,500 feet south of the northwest corner of section 11, T. 46 N., R. 63 E.; USGS Browns Bench Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 53 minutes 34 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 48 minutes 39 seconds longitude; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.8927778 latitude, -114.8108333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in the winter and spring, dry from July through October. Moist in all parts for 45 or more days in the 4 months following the winter solstice; xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock:  10 to 25 cm.
Rock fragments:  45 to 75 percent, mainly gravel with up to 5 percent cobbles.
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  40 to 60 percent.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  15 to 27 percent.

A horizon 
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent through violently effervescent.
Other features:  Common to continuous thin or medium carbonate pendants on undersides of rock fragments.

Bk horizons 
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam.
Other features:  Common to continuous thin to thick carbonate pendants on undersides of rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gollaher soils are on mountain and hill crests and side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from limestone or other strongly calcareous sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,740 to 2,685 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 460 mm; the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Shalcleav, Keman, Hackwood and Belsac series.  All of these soils have mixed mineralogy classes.  In addition, Shalcleav soils have an argillic horizon and Keman, Hackwood and Belsac soils have cryic temperature regimes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 25.
