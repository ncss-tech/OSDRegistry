GRIMSTONE SERIES

The Grimstone series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from noncalcareous, moderately fine textured very micaceous bedrocks.  These soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain slopes and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, micaceous Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Grimstone sandy loam - cut over land.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inches; undecomposed organic material, principally needles, bark, leaves, twigs, and the fleshy remains of grasses and shrubs.

    Oe--1 to 2 inches; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above.

    A--2 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; enough mica in small flakes to give the soil mass a soaplike consistency when moist and crushed; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    E--4 to 14 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; very weak thick platy structure parting to fine subangular blocky and then to medium granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; enough mica in small flakes to give the soil mass a soaplike consistency when moist and crushed; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 17 inches thick)

    E/B--14 to 22 inches; mixed light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; enough mica in small flakes to give the soil mass a soaplike consistency when moist and crushed; thin glossy patches on some faces of peds and discontinuous glossy coatings in some root channels and pores in the more clayey portion of this horizon; this horizon consists of seams and nodules of clayey material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a lighter colored matrix like that of the overlying horizon; slightly acid; (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt--22 to 29 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; peds are hard, friable; enough mica in small flakes to give the soil mass a soaplike consistency when moist and crushed; thin wax-like patches on faces of peds and discontinuous wax-like coatings and fillings in root channels and pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

    Cr--29 inches; weathered micaceous schist.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from moderately thin noncalcareous medium to moderately fine textured very micaceous material weathered form micaceous bedrock 
Landform:  hills, ridges, and mountain slopes
Slopes:  2 to 60 percent
Elevation:  7,000 to 9,700 feet
Mean annual temperature:  36 to 41 degrees F
Mean summer temperature is 52 degrees 
Mean annual precipitation:  17 to 24 inches
Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months:  March, April, May and June; driest months:  September and October
Frost-free period:  30 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Perceton and Siebert soils. Siebert soils have an argillic horizon in which silicate clay is accumulating as lamellae.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing or for limited timber production. Native vegetation is lodgepole pine, spruce, wild rose, fox barley, and elk sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 22 to 29 inches.  (Bt horizon)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 2 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)
Albic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 14 inches.  (E horizon)
Glossic horizon:  The zone from 14 to 22 inches.  (E/B horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 22 to 29 inches.  (Bt horizon)

The assignment of the paramicaceous mineralogy class is based on lab data from a similar soil in the area.

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
