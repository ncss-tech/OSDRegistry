GARMON SERIES

The Garmon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on shoulder slopes and steep hillsides on dissected uplands.  The soils formed in residuum of calcareous shale, siltstone, and limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Dystric Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Garmon channery silt loamin woods, on 40 percent slope. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A--0 to 2 inches, brown (10YR 5/3) channery silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 15 percent channers of shale; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick)

      Bw1--2 to 12 inches, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) channery silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable, non-sticky, non-plastic; common fine roots; 20 percent channers of siltstone and shale; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

      Bw2--12 to 26 inches, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) channery silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, non-sticky, non-plastic; few fine roots; 34 percent channers of shale and siltstone; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

      R--26 inches, hard siltstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Russell County, Kentucky; 11.9 miles southeast of Nancy, Kentucky, 1.4 miles northwest of intersection of KY Highway 196 and Wolf Creek Rd, 75 feet east of Wolf Creek Rd, in woods. USGS Elise Quad (Latitude: 37 degrees 0 minutes 2.1 seconds N; Longitude: 84 degrees 54 minutes 42.7 seconds W).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and from moderately acid to neutral in the lower part.  Shale, siltstone, or limestone channers or flags from less than 1 inch to 15 inches across range from 2 to 45 percent in individual horizons and the weighted average in the control section is 10 to 35 percent.

The A and Ap horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some A horizons have value of 3 or less, and are less than 6 inches thick.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is a silt loam or loam.

The BA or AB, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is a silt loam or loam. 

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.

The BC or C horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.   Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.

The R horizon is interbedded shale, siltstone, and limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Garmon soils are on upper shoulder slopes and on steep hillsides of highly dissected uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent.  The soils formed in residuum of calcareous shale, siltstone, and limestone.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 56.4 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 50.6 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baxter, Caneyville, Lowell, Newbern, and Trimble series.  Baxter, Lowell, and Trimble soils of have argillic horizons and have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.  Caneyville soils have an argillic horizon and are less than 40 inches over limestone. Newbern soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Surface runoff is very low to high.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in forest, pasture and hay.  The native vegetation was chiefly mixed forests of oaks, hickory, elm, hackberry, black walnut, yellow poplar, and red cedars.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Eastern Pennyroyal and Knobs regions of Kentucky, the eastern Highland Rim and outer Central Basin in Tennessee.  The soil is of large extent, more than 100,000 acres.
