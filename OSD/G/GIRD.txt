GIRD SERIES

The Gird series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits or alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gird silt loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw--10 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 17 inches thick)

    Bk1--17 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 24 inches thick)

    Bk2--32 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; disseminated lime, common fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Ravalli County (Bitterroot Valley Area), Montana, 1952.  Classification changed from typic to calcic for Lake County, Montana final correlation, 1991.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0661, MT0835, MT7048.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (Ap horizon); a cambic horizon from 10 to 17 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2 horizons).
