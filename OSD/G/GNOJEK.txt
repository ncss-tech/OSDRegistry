GNOJEK SERIES 

The Gnojek series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from hard fine grained sandstone or fine grained igneous rock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gnojek very cobbly loam, stony, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 25 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bt--3 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; 15 percent cobbles and 35 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick) 

    Bk--7 to 16 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent gravel; disseminated lime; common medium masses and threads of lime; common distinct lime coatings on fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). 

    R--16 inches; hard fine grained sandstone.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gnojek soils are primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass needleandthread, yarrow, big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, and Rocky Mountain juniper.  Some areas have widely scattered Douglas fir and limber pine.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT3050.  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 7 inches (A, Bt horizons); 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 7 inches (Bt horizon); 
Particle-size control section - the zone from the top of the argillic horizon to 16 inches (Bt, Bk horizons); 
Horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - the zone from 7 to 16 inches (Bk horizon); 
Lithic contact - hard fine grained sandstone bedrock at 16 inches (R horizon).  

Gnojek soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
