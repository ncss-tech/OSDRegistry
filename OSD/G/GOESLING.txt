GOESLING SERIES

The Goesling series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvial material derived from sandstone and shale on broad ridges, fan terraces and mesas. Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Goesling loamy sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--4 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots; many very fine continuous pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--8 to 15 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; common very fine continuous pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Btk--15 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderately fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine continuous pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonates as common fine irregular soft masses; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk1--30 to 42 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine continuous pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate as common fine and medium irregular soft masses; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

   Bk2--42 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine routs; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate segregated as many fine and medium irregular soft masses and seams; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alire (T) (NM), Banquito (NM), Brumley (CO), Maia (NM), Nomrah (NM), Pollow (T) (UT), and Todest (NM) series.  Alire soils have volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions. Brumley soils have 5YR hues. Maia soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the calcic horizon. Nomrah soils are deeper than 40 inches to the base of the argillic and are moderately permeable. Pollow and Todest soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Banquito soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goesling soils are on broad ridges, fan and stream terraces and mesas. The Goesling soils formed in eolian and alluvial material derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 6,700 feet. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 18 inches. The frost-free period is 115 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is Jacee and competing Celacy and Flugle soils. Jacee soils are moderately deep to sandstone.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation consists of oneseed juniper, blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, needleandthread, winterfat, galleta, rubber rabbitbrush, fourwing saltbush, and threeawn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This series is in westcentral New Mexico and northern Arizona. MLRA 35, LRR-D. The series is moderately extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: the zone from the surface to a depth of about 4 inches  (A horizon)

Argillic horizon: the zone from about 4 to 30 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons)
