COMPETING SERIES: There are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: hills and outwash plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over sandy outwash
Elevation: 2,789 to 3,107 feet (850 to 947 m)
Slope: 0 to 30 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 28 inches (564 to 715 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Schleyer and Slana soils. Schleyer soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on hills, mountains, outwash plains, and terraces. Slana soils are well drained, very deep and occur on hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the solum and high to very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is shrub birch-dwarf ericaceous scrub mosaic.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
