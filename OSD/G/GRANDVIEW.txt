GRANDVIEW SERIES

The Grandview series consists of very deep, moderately well and well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium.  Grandview soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Sodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Grandview loam -- on a southeast-facing slope of 4 percent, in rangeland at 2,515 feet elevation.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk1--13 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common pressure faces; strongly effervescent, common fine and medium soft masses of calcium carbonates; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    Bk2--22 to 35 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bz--35 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; few medium distinct mottles in the lower part, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; few salt veins; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Avalon, Minchey, Pariette and Redhouse series.  Avalon soils are well drained and lack mottles or a water table at depths above 60 inches.  Minchey soils lack cambic horizons.  Pariette soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Redhouse soils have color hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grandview soils are level to very gently sloping on concave parts of alluvial fans, stream terraces and floodplains at elevations of 2,200 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 8 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baldock, Bram, Bramwell and Garbutt series.  Baldock and Bramwell soils have mottles above a depth of 20 inches and are on lower landscape positions.  Bram soils are fine-silty in the control section.  Garbutt soils lack cambic horizons.  Bram and Garbutt soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained with high water table at 3.5 to 5 feet; slow runoff; slow permeability.  Some areas are artificially drained.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grandview soils are used mainly for irrigated hayland, pastureland and cropland.  Crops grown include sugar beets, corn and small grains.  Some areas are used for rangeland.  The dominant vegetation in uncultivated areas is mainly greasewood, inland saltgrass, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  Grandview soils are moderately extensive.
