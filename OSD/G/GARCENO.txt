GARCENO SERIES

The Garceno series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on interfluves.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Aridic Haplustepts

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jim Hogg County, Texas, 1970.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in) (Bk and Bkyz horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (A horizon)

Additional data: NSSL data number SO2-TX-427-001 from Starr County, Texas. NSSL lab data shows a fine-loamy control section but local data supports fine control section. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data collected in surrounding surveys.
