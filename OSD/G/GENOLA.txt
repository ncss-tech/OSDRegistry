GENOLA SERIES

The Genola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone and shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, basin floors, fan skirts and flood-plains and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Xeric Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Genola silt loam, on a 1 percent slope floodplain. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure that parts to moderate thin plates; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A2--3 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

    C1--15 to 38 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 45 cm thick)

    C2--38 to 74 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 43 cm thick)

    C3--74 to 107 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 33 cm thick)

    C4--107 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Utah County, Utah; about .25 miles south of Elberta, Utah; 1,100 feet south and 150 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 16, T. 10 S., R. 1 W.; USGS Goshen 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 56 minutes 56 seconds N. and longitude 111 degrees 57 minutes 20 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms (aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime). 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8.5 to 12 degrees C

Particle-size control section: 
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent

A horizon; Ab horizon (present in some pedons):
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4
Texture: Commonly loam, silt loam; less commonly thin layers of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy sand, silty clay loam, and clay loam
Clay content: averages 18 to 27 percent, but individual horizons can range to 35 percent
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline
                
COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alovar (UT) and Woodrow (UT) series. Alovar soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y. Woodrow and Alovar soils are clay loam or silty clay loam with 28 to 35 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Genola soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans, alluvial flats, basin floors, fan skirts, and floodplains at elevations of 1,219 to 2,105 m. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from sandstone, limestone, and shale. The climate is semiarid, and the average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C., and the freeze-free period ranges from 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anco, Centerfield, Freedom, Sigurd, Stake (T), and the competing Woodrow soils. Anco soils have mottles at depths between 50 and 100 cm or chroma of 1. Centerfield soils are carbonatic. Freedom soils have a calcic horizon. Sigurd soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Stake soils have a cumulic mollic epipedon and a fine control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, slow or medium runoff. Moderate permeability above a depth of 100 cm and moderate or moderately slow below 100 cm; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for growing irrigated crops of alfalfa, small grains, pasture, sugar beets, and corn and as rangeland. The potential natural vegetation is shadscale, Basin big sagebrush, winterfat, bluebunch wheatgrass and Indian ricegrass.  These soils are correlated to semidesert ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and southern Utah and southern Idaho. MLRA 28A. These soils are moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richfield Area, Utah, 1947.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 cm.
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 15 cm. (A1, A2 horizon)
