GYPPOCKET SERIES

The Gyppocket series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from sedimentary formations with high gypsum and lime content.  Gyppocket soils are on colluvial slopes and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gyppocket soils are on colluvial slopes and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations dominated by limestone and gypsum.  Elevation ranges from 4000 to 5000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 195 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Goblin, Robroost, and Nutter soils.  Goblin soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches.  Robroost soils are coarse-loamy.  Nutter soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; slow to medium runoff;  moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gyppocket soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is gyp dropseed, galleta, bush muhly, black grama, Mormon-tea, blue yucca, and wolfberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
