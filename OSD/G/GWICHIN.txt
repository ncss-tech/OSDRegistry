SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska; 2020

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 35 to 110 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Redoximorphic iron concentrations--2C3, 2C4, 2Cf horizons
*Permafrost--2Cf horizon
*Irregular decrease in organic carbon content--zone from 25 to 45 cm
A horizons may be thicker than 15 cm when buried, stratified, or otherwise mixed with B or C horizons; in these cases surface horizons do not meet criteria for mollic epipedons after mixing the upper 18 cm of mineral soil.
