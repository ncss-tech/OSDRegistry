GRIER SERIES

The Grier series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvial materials associated with the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on level to nearly level playa benches. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in) and mean annual temperature is about 16 C (61 degrees F)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Endoaquepts

COMPETING SERIES:There are no series in the same family. Similar soils include theCedarlake, Chapel,  Lamesa, andYellowlake series.
Chapel soils: have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and do not have endosaturation.
Cedarlake soils: have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and a salic horizon.
Lamesa soils: have an argillic horizon and a hue of 7.5YR or redder.
Yellowlake soils: have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and a natric horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy alluvial sediments derived from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.
Landform: on low level benches in playas or basins below the surrounding plain.
Slopes: range from 0 to 2 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 381 to 457 mm (15 to 18 in)
Frost-free period: 180 to 205 days.
Elevation: 1,036 to 1,341 m (3,400 to 4,400 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:These are theArch,Drake,Randall, andPortalesseries.
Arch,DrakeandPortalessoils: are on higher positions and are well drained.
Randallsoils: occupies the lowest portion of the playa, have a clay particle-size control section, and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow. Permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:Used mainly for rangeland or wildlife habitat. The natural plant community is a mixture of salt tolerant grasses and grass-like plants, forbs, and shrubs. Vegetation includes alkali sacaton, Texas dropseed, creeping muhly, joint tail, sedge and rushes, inland saltgrass and occasionally some western wheatgrass. Forbs includes portulaca sp., kochia, smartweed, dock and annual forbs. Woody species include salt cedar, Tamarix and Baccharis being the two most prevalent species. In areas of standing water, cattails may be present. The established plant community may fluctuate due mainly to the degree of salinity and the hydrology. This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline (077CY689TX) range site in MLRA-77C.
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of eastern New Mexico and possibly western Texas. The series is not extensive.
