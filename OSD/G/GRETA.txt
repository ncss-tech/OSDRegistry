GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Inari, Orelia, Wyick, Vidauri, and Woodsboro series.

Inari soils: have a sodium adsorption ratio less than 13 in the upper subsoil and are on rises on the coastal plain.
Orelia soils: have a sodium adsorption ratio less than 13 in the upper subsoil, a mollic epipedon, and are on similar landforms.
Wyick soils: have a sodium adsorption ratio less than 13 in the upper subsoil, are better drained, and are on slightly higher landscape positions.
Vidauri soils: have a sodium adsorption ratio less than 13 in the upper subsoil and are on lower landscape positions in weakly-defined drainageways.
Woodsboro soils: have a higher sodium adsorption ration in the upper subsoil; are wet for longer periods; and are on lower landscape positions in drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high.  A perched water table will occur on top of the natric horizon for a period of a few days to several weeks during late fall and winter months in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Typical vegetation includes salt-tolerant species.  Ecological site name: Salty Prairie 25-35" Pz; Ecological site number: R150AY540TX

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Prairies (MLRA 150A in LRR T) on the coastal plain of Texas from the tributaries of the San Antonio River to the Mission River; small extent

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Goliad County, Texas, 2009.  The name is from the Greta siding.

REMARKS:  These soils were previously included with the Orelia series.  During the update soil survey of MLRA 150A and initial soil survey of Goliad County, some areas previously mapped as Orelia clearly showed signs of higher salinity in plant communities and growth.  Lab data and pedon descriptions confirmed a difference in these soils.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 13 to 64 cm (5 to 25 in).  (Btn1 and Btn2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in).  (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 13 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in).  (Btn1, Btn2, Btn3, Btk1, Btk2, and Btk3 horizons)
Natric horizon: 13 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in).  (Btn1, Btn2, Btn3, Btk1, Btk2, and Btk3 horizons)
Aquic conditions: 13 to 63 cm (5 to 25 in) during the spring and fall months in normal years. 
Abrupt textural change: At the upper boundary of the Btn1 horizon

ADDITIONAL DATA:  National Soil Survey Laboratory data on pedon S01TX-175-003 from the series type location.
