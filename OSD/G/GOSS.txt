GOSS SERIES 

The Goss series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from cherty limestone or cherty dolomite and some interbedded shale.  These soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Typic Paleudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Goss gravelly silt loam - on a 25 percent slope in forest at an elevation of 600 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 15 percent chert gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick) 

   E--6 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 65 percent chert gravel; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 17 inches thick) 

   2Bt1--19 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) and red (2.5YR 4/6) extremely gravelly silty clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 65 percent chert gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. 

   2Bt2--28 to 43 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) gravelly silty clay; many medium prominent brown (10YR 5/3) mottles; moderate fine angular and subangular blocky structure; very firm; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

   2Bt3--43 to 54 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) gravelly silty clay; few medium prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) mottles; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very firm; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

   2Bt4--54 to 63 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very gravelly silty clay; common medium prominent red (2.5YR 5/6) mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very firm; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 45 percent chert gravel; few fine masses of iron and manganese accumulations on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 40 inches to several feet). 

   3C--63 to 69 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) clay; many medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) masses of iron accumulation; massive; very firm, neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  Similar series include the Clarksville, Doniphan, Gepp, Noark, Poynor, and Rueter soils.  Clarksville and Rueter soils are loamy-skeletal.  Doniphan and Gepp soils are clayey.  Poynor soils are loamy-skeletal over clayey.  Noark soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent at the critical depth. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goss soils are on uplands and formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from cherty limestone or cherty dolomite and some interbedded shale. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 44 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gasconade, Gatewood, Peridge and Wilderness soils in the southern part of the series extent and Keswick and Lindley soils in the northern part.  Gasconade soils are very shallow or shallow.  Gatewood soils are moderately deep.  The Gasconade and Gatewood soils are in similar positions where depth to rock is less than 40 inches.  Peridge soils are fine-silty and are on higher positions in the landscape.  Wilderness soils have a fragipan and are on higher positions in the landscape.  Keswick and Lindley soils are fine and fine-loamy respectively and formed in glacial till on higher positions in the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Runoff is low to high. Permeability is moderate. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Areas are used for woodland and pasture.  Native vegetation is upland hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois.  The series is of large extent.
