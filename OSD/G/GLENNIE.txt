GLENNIE SERIES

The Glennie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy till on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glennie soils are on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent; the well drained phase, which is no longer part of the series concept and will become a new series, has slopes ranging from 12 to 35 percent. The Glennie soils formed in dense fractured till that is underlain by coarse textured stratified glaciofluvium at depths greater than 3 meters (10 feet). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Killmaster and Lupton soils. The somewhat poorly drained Killmaster soils are in a drainage sequence with the Glennie soils. The very poorly drained Lupton soils are in the closed depressional areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 107 to 137 cm (3.5 to 4.5 feet) between November and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the upper part and low in the fragipan and substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very slow in the fragipan and substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: A major portion of the soil is forested. Tree species include bigtooth aspen, eastern white pine, white ash, paper birch, northern red oak, American beech, red maple and balsam fir. Other areas are used as pastureland and cropland. The common crops include hay, alfalfa and occasionally corn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northeastern quarter of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: The well drained phase is no longer in the concept of Glennie series and may become a new series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (7 inches) (Oe, A, and E horizons).
