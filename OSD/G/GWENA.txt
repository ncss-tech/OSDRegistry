GWENA SERIES

The Gwena series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Gwena soils are on fan-piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gwena soils are on fan-piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,400 to 2,000 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bliss and Enko series.  Bliss soils have cambic horizons and a strongly cemented duripans below 51 cm.  Enko soils have cambic horizons and a continuous weak silica cemented subhorizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Thurber needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central and central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24, 27.
