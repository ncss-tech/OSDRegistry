GOODNIGHT SERIES

The Goodnight series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy eolian sediments of Holocene age. These soils occur on reworked, stabilized dunes adjacent to flood plains of major streams, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 860 mm (34 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Typic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Goodnight loamy fine sand, in rangeland, at an elevation of 241 m (790 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); brown (7.5YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 36 cm [4 to 14 in])

    C1--13 to 41 cm (5 to 16 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    C2--41 to 102 cm (16 to 40 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) fine sand, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; single grain; loose; neutral; clear smooth boundary. 

    C3--102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) fine sand, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; single grain; loose; bedding strata and some cross bedding; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline. (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 78 to 190 cm [31 to 75 in] thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Payne County, Oklahoma; about 5 miles north on OK-18 Highway and 1 mile east of Cushing; about 600 feet south and 200 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 11, T. 18 N., R. 5 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to bedrock: more than 203 cm (80 in)
Depth to calcareous material: 0 to more than 203 cm (0 to 80 in)

A horizon or Ap horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist
Chroma: 3 to 8
Texture (upper part): fine sand or loamy fine sand
Texture (lower part): fine sand or loamy fine sand with bedding strata of eolian material. Cross-bedding is common. 
Other features: sandy alluvial sediments with loamy strata occur in some pedons below a depth of 152 cm (60 in)
Effervescence class: none to slight
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jester, Southside, and Tivoli series in the same family.
Jester and Tivoli soils: are dryer in the control section for longer periods
Southside soils: formed in sandy and/or gravelly alluvium of Pleistocene age

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: formed in material weathered from sandy eolian Holocene age sediments
Landscape: dune fields
Landform: reworked stabilized dunes adjacent to flood plains of major streams 
Slope: 0 to 45 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 737 to 991 mm (29 to 39 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 15 to 17.2 degrees C (59 to 63 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 229 to 442 m (750 to 1450 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amber, Derby, Gaddy, Gracemore, Hawley, Miller, Reinach, and Yahola series. 
Amber and Reinach soils: are coarse-silty and occur on flood plains
Derby soils: contain lamellae and are on higher positions
Gaddy soils: formed in sandy alluvium and occur on flood plains adjacent positions
Gracemore soils: have a water table within a depth 102 cm (40 in) 
Miller soils: have a fine control section on flood plains
Yahola soils: have a coarse-loamy control section on flood plains

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: excessively drained
Permeability: rapid
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 5 percent slopes, very low on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and low on 20 to 45 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for grazing livestock. Improved pastures are mainly bermudagrass or lovegrass. Present native vegetation includes prairie sandreed, little bluestem, sand paspalum, sand dropseed, sand lovegrass, stinging nettle, prickly pear cactus, sand plum, American elm, redbud, chittamwood, eastern red cedar, eastern cottonwood, live oak, and post oak. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Oklahoma and Texas; LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). The series is of small extent.
