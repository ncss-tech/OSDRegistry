GEISERCREEK SERIES

The Geisercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on backslopes to toeslopes of mountains. Geisercreek soils are formed in a mantle of volcanic ash overlying material derived from soft tuffs. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TYPICAL PEDON: Geisercreek ashy silt loam woodland, on a 35 percent west-facing slope at an elevation of 5440 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Textures are apparent field textures.)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Flycreek series.
Flycreek soils - 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact (tuff)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Geisercreek soils occur on backslopes to toeslopes of mountains. Elevations are 4,800 to 6,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Geisercreek soils are formed in a mantle of volcanic ash overlying material derived from soft tuffs. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Limberjim soils which are on steep side slopes of mountains and are ashy over loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; permeability is moderately rapid in the upper ashy layers and slow in the lower layers.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, watershed, wildlife habitat and recreation. The native vegetation is grand fir, western larch, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, grouse whortleberry, bearberry, prince's pine, Oregon grapeholly, twinflower, sidebells pyrola, white flowered hawkweed, woods strawberry, roundleaf violet, lupine, pinegrass, northwestern sedge and elk sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 9. Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon. The soils are of limited extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Union County, Oregon 1998. The name is from a stream in Baker County.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - from 3 to 15 inches (Bw and BC horizons)

Argillic horizon - from 24 to 45 inches (2Btb and 2BCtb horizons)

Ash mantle - from 0 to 15 inches

Particle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches with contrasting classes based on 0 to 15 inches (ashy) and 24 to 40 inches (clayey). This series concept might also have an ashy over loamy class; however, ashy over clayey is the most contrasting

The 2Eb horizon may also be described as a 2Ab, 2Aeb, 2Ebb, 2Bwb, or 2Bw in other areas where this series concept is recognized

The dominant USFS plant association is ABGR/LIB02; others may include ABGR/VASC and ABGR/CARU
