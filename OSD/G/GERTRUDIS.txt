GERTRUDIS SERIES

The Gertrudis series consists of very deep, moderately permeable, well drained soils that have formed in loamy eolian deposits over calcareous loamy alluvium of Quaternary age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on erosional terrace remnants.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters (26 in).
