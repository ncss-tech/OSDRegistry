GOREEN SERIES

The Goreen series is a member of the clayey, mixed, thermic family
of Typic Albaquults.  These soils have grayish brown fine sandy
loam A horizons and dark brown clay Btg horizons with red and yellowish red mottles.  They are underlain with weakly cemented sandstone and shaly clay at about 31 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Albaquults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goreen fine sandy loam - forested.
         (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

     A     --  0-13 inches, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy
loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable;
many medium and coarse roots; common fine pores; few siliceous pebbles 15-20 mm. in diameter; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

     B21tg --  13-26 inches, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay; many
medium prominent red (10R 4/8) mottles; moderate fine blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many medium and coarse roots; few fine pores; thick continuous clay films on the faces of peds; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (9 to
14 inches thick)

     B22tg --  26-31 inches, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay; common medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles; moderate fine
blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine
and medium roots; few fine pores; few fragments of weakly cemented sandstone throughout the horizon; thick continuous clay films on
the faces of peds; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5
to 12 inches thick)

Cr     --  31-40 inches, weakly cemented sandstone interbedded
with brown shaly clay; massive; hard; few fine roots in the clay filled interstices; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Walker County, Texas; from the intersection of
Texas Highway 19 and Farm Road 230 in Trinity, Texas, west 6.1
miles on Farm Road 230; then north on Chalk Cementery Road 4.1
miles and 75 feet east of road in woods.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 20 to
40 inches.

The A horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), or dark gray (10YR 4/1).  Some pedons have A2 horizons that are light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or brown (10YR 5/3).  The A horizon
ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.

The B21tg and B22tg horizons are dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2),
brown (7.5YR 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or grayish
brown (10YR 5/2).  Mottles in shades of red, yellowish red, strong brown, yellow, or gray range from few to many.  Clay content in
the B2tg horizon ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges
from strongly to extremely acid.  Base saturation above the C
horizon ranges from 15 to 30 percent.

The Cr layer is weakly to strongly cemented sandstone or siltstone interbedded with shaly clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arol,
Bladen, Falba, Leaf, Narlon, Rosenwall, and Vinita series.  Arol
and Falba soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent.  Bladen, Leaf, and Narlon soils have sola more than 40 inches
thick.  Rosenwall soils have udic moisture regimes, hues redder
than 7.5YR in the B21t horizon and more than 60 percent clay in
the B21t horizon.  Vinita soils have udic moisture regimes and are dominated by chromas of 3 or more in the B2t horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goreen soils are on uplands.  They are on concave footslope positions that receive extra water as runoff from soils above or lateral seepage from associated sandy soils.  Slopes
range from 1 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in stratified
sandstone and shaly clay sediments of the Manning and Wellborn formations.  At the type location, the mean annual precipitation
is about 46 inches, the average annual temperature is 68 degrees
F., and Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 72.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Rosenwall series, and the Gomery series.  Gomery soils have sandy surface layers 20 to 40 inches thick and sola more than 40 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium
runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Small areas have been cleared for pasture and some are cultivated.  Used mainly for timber production.  Native vegetation consists of an overstory of loblolly and shortleaf pine and many varieties of oak trees with an understory of eastern
little bluestem, longleaf uniola, sedges, and panicums.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Texas and possibly western Louisiana.  Series is of moderate extent.
