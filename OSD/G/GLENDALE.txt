GLENDALE SERIES

The Glendale series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium.  Glendale soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains, and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Glendale loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Ck1--8 to 18 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular and few fine irregular pores; common very fine and fine irregular accumulations of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    Ck2--18 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stratified silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common very fine and fine irregular accumulations of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Graham County, Arizona; about 5 miles south of Safford; 400 feet east of the northwest corner of Section 5, T. 8 S., R. 26 E.  The PLSS location plots in an area of Gila loam.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Rock Fragments:  usually nongravelly, but may range to 35 percent in any one horizon

Organic Matter:  less than 1 percent that decreases irregularly with depth

Stratification:  usually less than 1 inch thick strata of finer or coarser material

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to  5 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist
Texture:  loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam
Reaction:  neutral to strongly alkaline
Calcium carbonate:  slightly to violently effervescent as disseminated or fine irregular accumulations

Buried horizons:  A buried argillic horizon is present at depths greater than 40 inches in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Pima (AZ) and Rift (AZ) series. Pima soils have more than 1 percent organic matter to depths of 20 inches or more. Rift soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Glendale soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains at elevations of 1,500 to 5,100 feet.  These soils formed in stratified alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anthony, Brazito, Gila, Grabe, Hantz and the competing Pima soils.  Anthony, Gila, and Grabe soils are coarse-loamy.  Arizo soils are sandy-skeletal.  Brazito soils are sandy.  Hantz soils are fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Glendale soils are used for livestock grazing and irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is creosotebush, mesquite, palo verde, ironwood, salt cedar, cacti, annual forbs and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.  This series is extensive. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRAs 40, 41, and 42.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon)

Entisol feature - the absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons

Fluvial feature - irregular decrease in organic carbon in the zone from 8 to 60 inches (Ck1, Ck2 horizons)
