MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Leavenworth and Wyandotte Counties, Kansas, 1973. 

REMARKS: This soil was originally mapped as one soil on two different landscapes 
(uplands and terraces) and derived from two different parent materials. The red color of 
the soil was the only characteristic of these soils in common. During the MLRA update 
Gymer is to be relegated to the terrace position along rivers and streams, while the Polo 
series will replace the Gymer mapped on the upland. Pedon used is 94KS045001. Lab 
data were run at the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, Nebraska. Lab samples 
were 94P6334S-94P6341S. The Gymer soil was reclassified from the fine to the fine-silty 
family.
09/2008 GJJ Changed from fine to fine-silty, removed smectitic and added mixed, 
superactive, added some metric conversions, removed English units, and some format 
changes. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 36 to 86 centimeters . (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 36 centimeters. (A, horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 36 to 114 centimeters . (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska. 
Characterization data pedons: 94KS045002 and 94KS103001. The assignment of the 
cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers 94P6336S - 
94KS6338S.
