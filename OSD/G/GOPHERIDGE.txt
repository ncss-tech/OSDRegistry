COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hetchy, Hurleton, Oroshore, and Gardellones series. Hetchy soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to paralithic contact of metasedimentary rock. Hurleton soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact of intrusive igneous rock. Oroshore soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a paralithic contact. Gardellones soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Gopheridge soils are on backslopes and footslopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from greenstone and other metavolcanic rocks. Elevation is 80 to 835 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 405 to 875 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 215 to 335 days.

Bonanza soils are 25 to 50 cm to a paralithic contact and are on summits, shoulders, and upper backslopes. The competing Gardellones soils are 100 to 150 cm to a paralithic contact and are on lower backslopes and footslopes. Jasperpeak soils are 25 to 50 cm to a lithic contact, and are on shoulders and upper backslopes. Loafercreek soils are have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact. Motherlode soils are have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section, are 100 to 150 cm to a paralithic contact. Loafercreek and Motherlode soils are on lower backslopes and footslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the A and upper Bt horizons and moderately low in the lower Bt horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for rangeland, recreation, wildlife habitat, and homesites. Vegetation is blue oak woodland with wild oat, annual ryegrass, rattlesnake brome, soft chess, red brome, ripgut brome, foxtail fescue, tarweed, and forbs. Scattered interior live oak and foothill pine may be present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills in California; MLRA 18. The series is moderately extensive.
