GILLENDER SERIES

The Gillender series consists of very shallow, moderately well drained soils on hills with mound and swale microrelief. These soils are in the swales between mounds. Gillender soils formed in residuum weathered from rhyolite or acidic tuff and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 17 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is 560 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, thermic, shallow Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gillender loam on a southeast-facing, 5 percent, concave, complex slope, under annual grasses and forbs at an elevation of 56 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated. When described December 27, 1979, the soil was moist throughout.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6)mottles, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; moderate fine granular and weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--5 to 10 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure, slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine and common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 25 cm thick)

    AC--10 to 18 cm; variegated light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Cr--18 to 51 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) weakly cemented acidic tuff, light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) moist; moderately acid (pH 5.8, chlorphenol red).

TYPE LOCATION: Sacramento County, California; about 6.6 km (4.1 mi) southeast of Bridge House, 1.6 km (1.0 mi) west of intersection of Ione and Meiss Rd., 4.5 meters (15 feet) north of the fence along Meiss Rd., 1,500 feet south and 1,620 feet east of the northwest corner of Sec. 26, T. 7N., R. 8E. USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle: Carbondale, California; WGS84 38.4335390 latitude -121.0708040 longitude. UTM Zone 10; 668384 meters E 4255681 meters N NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at the lithic contact is 18 to 19 degrees C and remains above 8 degrees C throughout the year. The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a thermic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to October. The soils have a xeric moisture regime. 

Diagnostic features:
Ochric epipedon: 10 to 25 cm
Depth to paralithic contact: 10 to 25 cm

Particle size control section weighted averages:
Clay content: 12 to 25 percent
Coarse and very coarse sand content: less than 15 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gillender soils are in swales on hills with mound and swale microrelief.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. These soils have formed in residuum weathered from rhyolite or acidic tuff of the Valley Springs formation. Elevation ranges from 40 to 115 meters. The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 430 to 510 mm. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 17 degrees C. The mean July air temperature is about 25 degrees C and the mean January temperature is about 8 degress C. Frost-free period is 340 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amador, Hadselville, Pardee, Pentz and Vleck soils. Amador soils have a cambic horizon and are on mounds. Hadselville and Pentz soils can also develop in mound and swale topography, but form from basic volcaniclastc rocks, and have mollic epipedons. Hadselville soils are in swales and Pentz forms in mounds. Pardee soils form on terrace remnants, eroded fan remnants, and hills from alluvium, have an argillic horizon, and have greater than 35 percent fragments in the particle size control section. Vleck soils are on footslopes and toeslopes of hills, have an argillic horizon, and have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the solum. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is moderately high. Brief periods of ponding occur after heavy rains.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are primarily used for rangeland. Vegetation is mouse barley, annual hairgrass, toadrush, and other annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sacramento County, California. 1983. Source of name is coined.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (A1, A2, and AC horizon)
Paralithic contact: 18 to 51 cm (Cr horizon)

Particle size control section for this pedon: 0 to 18 cm.

Theses soils were previously mapped as Amador soils in the Sacramento Area Soil Survey Report (1954).

The mottles described in the A horizon may be masses of oxidized iron. Whether or not these are redoximorphic features should be investigated as it would be a diagnostic feature and support impaired drainage.
