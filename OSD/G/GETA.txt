GETA SERIES

The Geta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from predominantly volcanic rocks with some influence from limestone.  The Geta soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, stream terraces, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Geta gravelly sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 10 percent pebbles.

    A1--0 to 1 inch; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 6 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 15 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial and common very fine and fine tubular pores; few lime coats on undersides of rock fragments; 10 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk1--15 to 20 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial and few very fine and fine tubular pores; many moderately thick lime coats on undersides and sides of rock fragments; 10 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk2--20 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial and few very fine and fine tubular pores; common moderately thick lime coats on undersides and sides of rock fragments; 25 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; approximately 3 miles south of Tule Desert Well; about 1250 feet west and 925 feet south of the northeast corner of section 24, T. 10 S., R. 68 E.; 37 degrees, 3 minutes, and 30 seconds north latitude, 114 degrees, 19 minutes, and 46 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in late summer and for short periods in winter and spring.

Soil temperature - 59 to 64 degrees F.



Control section - Clay content:  5 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments:  Average 5 to 15 percent, predominantly 2 to 5 millimeter pebbles.

Other features:  Has more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.



A horizon - Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.

Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4.



Bw horizon - Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.

Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4.

Texture of the fine earth:  Very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.

Clay content:  5 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments:  5 to 15 percent.

Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.



Bk horizons - Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.

Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4.

Texture of the fine earth:  Very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.

Clay content:  5 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, thin subhorizons in the upper part have 5 to 15 percent pebbles in most pedons.

Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Carbonates:  Horizons have common or many moderately thick or thick lime coats on undersides of rock fragments.

Other features:  Some pedons contain lenses of gravelly or very gravelly textures.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Perilla (T)(AZ) series. Perilla soils are moist during the period July through September and receive 12 to 16 inches of precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Geta soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, stream terraces,  and fan skirts.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from predominantly volcanic rocks with minor influence from limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot, intermittently moist summers and cool winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; the mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 190 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Mormount, and Canutio series.  Arizo soils are occasionally flooded and have a sandy-skeletal control section.  Mormount soils are less than 20 inches to a petrocalcic horizon.  Canutio soils have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly big galleta, Anderson wolfberry, and Joshua-tree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Nevada.  MLRA 30.  These soils are moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lincoln County, Nevada, South Part, 1992.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 6 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).

Cambic horizon - The zone from 6 to 15 inches (Bw horizon).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 15 to 60 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)

Ustic feature - Soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for less than three-fourths of the time, when soil temperature exceeds 4 degrees C, and the moisture regime borders the ustic regime.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk2 horizon).

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015. The last revision to the series was 5/1997. ET
