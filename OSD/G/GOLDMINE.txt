GOLDMINE SERIES

The Goldmine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from igneous rocks. Goldmine soils are on mountain hillslopes. Slopes range from 3 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 mm (29 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Palecryolls

 Bt2--94 to 152 cm (37 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and fine roots; about 50 percent faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) clay films on ped faces and 15 percent faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) clay films on rock fragments; about 85 percent igneous rock fragments, of which 65 percent are angular channers and 20 percent are flagstones; neutral. (Combined Bt horizons greater than 50 cm (20 inches) thick)

Elevation: 1575 to 2125 meters
Mean annual air temperature: 6 to 8 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 650 to 760 mm
Precipitation pattern: In most years, about half the annual precipitation occurs as snow or rain during the period March through June. T
Frost-free period: 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grizzly and Virkula series. The Grizzly soils do not have mollic epipedons and are on similar landscape positions. Virkula soils are fine-silty and are on linear to concave slopes below Goldmine soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Goldmine soils formed under a mixed coniferous and deciduous forest and are utilized for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, timber production, and suburban development. The native vegetation consists of an overstory of ponderosa pine, Black Hills spruce, and aspen; understory species include bearberry, snowberry, ground juniper, Oregon grape, brachen fern, thimbleberry, beebalm, false Solomonseal, bearded wheatgrass, roughleaf ricegrass, and Timothy.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Goldmine soils occur in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming; LRR G, MLRA 62; the series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Extensive revision of the Soil Survey of Lawrence County, South Dakota. The name is coined from the abundance of contemporary and historic mining activity in the area of the type location.
