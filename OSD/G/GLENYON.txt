GLENYON SERIES

The Glenyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Glenyon silty clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary.   (1 to 3 inches thick)

    By--2 to 11 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; few gypsum crystals; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

    Cy--11 to 34 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few gypsum crystals; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (17 to 23 inches thick)

    2C1--34 to 45 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy sand; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; single grain; loose; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    2C2--45 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy fine sand; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)

TYPE LOCATION:  Coconino County, Arizona; about .25 mile north of Fredonia; 2000 feet west, 500 feet south of the southeast corner of section 8, T. 41 N., R. 2 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic moisture regime.

Soil temperature - 53 to 58 degrees F.

Rock fragments - Less than 5 percent gravel

Depth to contrasting layer - 30 to 36 inches

Gypsum - 0 to 3 percent

Electrical conductivity - ranges to 7 dS/m

Texture - averages 35 to 40 percent clay above the contrasting layer and less than 20 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Below the contrasting layer is loamy sand or loamy fine sand averaging less than l5 percent clay.

A horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 through 6, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Glenyon soils are on low stream terraces.  These soils formed in stratified mixed alluvium of Holocene age.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 4700 to 5000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches in the form of summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  Mean annual air temperature is 52 to 57 degree F.  Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mespun and Barx soils.  Mespun soils are sandy.  Barx soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  A seasonal irrigation induced water table may be present at depths of 20 inches or more.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and irrigated cropland.  Vegetation is mainly greasewood, western wheatgrass, fourwing saltbush and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  The Glenyon series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
