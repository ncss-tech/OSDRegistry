GARDENVALLEY SERIES 

The Gardenvalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash and minor amounts of limestone. The Gardenvalley soils are on inset fans and fan skirts. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Gardenvalley gravelly fine sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is partially covered with 30 percent gravel. Lithology of the gravel is welded tuff.

(25 to 76 cm thick) 

 2Bk--112 to 157 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; common (5 percent) fine (1 to 2 mm) secondary calcium carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 40 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; about 10.5 miles west of the Water Gap and about 4.25 miles east of the Freiburg Mine, and about 50 feet south of the jeep trail, in Garden Valley; approximately 800 feet north and 1,800 feet east of the southwest corner of section 7, T. 1 N., R. 58 E.; USGS Worthington Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 57 minutes and longitude 37 seconds N and 115 degrees 30 minutes and 20 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.9602778 latitude, -115.5055556 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to summer convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime. 
Soil temperature: 11 to 13 degrees C.
Depth to cambic horizon: 5 to 13 cm.
Thickness of cambic horizon: 25 to 50 cm.
Depth to durinodes: 30 to 60 cm. 
Volcanic glass content: 5 to 25 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 millimeter fraction. 
Other features: The estimated product of the ammonium extractable aluminum plus half the iron times 60 plus the volcanic glass is 20 to 30.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Broyles, Crockies, Keefa, Strike and Weso series. 
Broyles and Crockies soils do not receive summer moisture and do not have calcium carbonate in the Bw horizon. 
Keefa soils have Bqk horizons with a hard, firm and brittle matrix. 
Strike soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative in the summer and have 2Bkq and 2C horizons with calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 25 percent. 
Weso soils do not receive summer moisture, do not have calcium carbonate in the Bw horizon and have a hard, firm and brittle matrix in the Bqk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gardenvalley soils are on inset fans and fan skirts. These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash and minor amounts of limestone. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,690 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season ranges from about 110 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devildog and Qwynn series. Devildog soils do not have durinodes and have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. Qwynn soils have an argillic horizon and do not have durinodes and have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Gardenvalley soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes winterfat, bud sagebrush, and Indian ricegrass. This pedon is correlated to R029XY042NV, Coarse Silty 5-8 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 29.
