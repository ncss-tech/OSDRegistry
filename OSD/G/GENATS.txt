GENATS SERIES

The Genats series consists of well drained, slowly permeable soils which are moderately deep to shale.  Genats soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale on footslopes and backslopes of plateaus, mesas, structural benches, and escarpments.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, nonacid, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Genats channery loamy fine sand--on a backslope sloping 22 percent to the south at 5,670 feet elevation--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

TYPE LOCATION:  San Juan County, New Mexico; about 6.5 miles northeast of Sheep Springs; 1,000 feet south and 2,340 feet west of northeast corner of section 1, T. 22 N., R. 17 W.; Latitude 36 degrees 10 minutes 29 seconds N and Longitude 108 degrees 36 minutes 11 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil moisture control section is assumed to be dry for more than 75 percent of the time (cumulative) when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is moist in some part from July through September and December through March. Typic aridic moisture regime.

Soil temperature - 53 to 57 degrees F.

Soil depth - 20 to 40 inches to soft bedrock

Silicate clay content, control section weighted average - 35 to 55 percent

Depth to base of calcareous material - 6 to 10 inches

Calcium carbonate equivalent - ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the surface, 0 to 1 percent in the underlying horizons

Soil reaction - ranges from strongly alkaline in the Bw horizon to slightly acid in the C horizons

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Genats soils are on footslopes and backslopes of plateaus, mesas, structural benches, and escarpments.  Genats soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from cretaceous shale.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Benally, Brimhall and Werito soils.  Benally soils are deep, fine-loamy, and have natric horizons on adjacent toeslopes.  Brimhall soils are deep, coarse-loamy, and have calcic and gypsic horizons.  Werito soils have cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is rapid.  Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Genats soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is alkali sacaton, galleta, sickle saltbush and mound saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Genats soils are of small extent on the western San Juan Basin portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico.  LRR-D; MLRA 35.
