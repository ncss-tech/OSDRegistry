GALLEN SERIES

The Gallen series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from gravelly calcareous material.  Gallen soils are on hillslopes and fan terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gallen very gravelly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and few medium roots; 40 percent pebbles; calcium coatings on undersides of pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 33cm thick)

    Bk1--10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 70 percent pebbles; calcium carbonate coatings on all sides of pebbles; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (18 to 41 cm thick)

    Bk2--38 to 64 cm (15 to 25 in); light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; 80 percent pebbles; coatings of calcium carbonate on undersides of pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 38 cm thick)

    2Bky1--64 to 76 cm (25 to 30 in); light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sand; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; 90 percent pebbles; coatings of calcium carbonate on underside of pebbles; few sand size gypsum crystals; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    2Bky2--76 to 150 cm (30 to 60 in); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) very gravelly sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 50 percent pebbles; some undersides of pebbles coated with calcium carbonate; pendants of gypsum on undersides of pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0)

2Bky horizon (where present):
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7, 4 or 5 moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chilicotal (TX), Gilland (NM), Polar (TX), Powerline (AZ) and Tombstone (AZ) series.
Chilicotal soils: 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section
Gilland soils: paralithic contact at 50 to 76 cm
Polar soils: moist for longer periods in the moisture control section mainly in spring
Powerline soils: 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact
Tombstone soils: receive significant winter precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material:  gravelly calcareous alluvium
Landform:  hillslopes and fan terraces
Slope:  1 to 50 percent
Mean annual temperature:  14 to 20 degrees C (57 to 68 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation:  305 to 381 mm (12 to 15 in).
Precipitation pattern:  Most precipitation occurs in the summer during brief heavy thunderstorms
Frost-free period: 180 to 240 days.
Elevation: 1,060 to 1,620 meters (3,800 to 5,400 ft).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ratliff and Redona soils.  Ratliff and Redona soils: have less than five percent pebbles in the control section and are on higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 3 percent, very low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, low on 5 to 10 percent slopes, medium on 10 to 20 percent slopes, and high on slopes greater than 20 percent.
