GOODWATER SERIES

The Goodwater series consists of shallow to cemented pan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Goodwater soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 millimeters (11 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (53 degrees F.). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic, shallow Calcic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Goodwater very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland and wildlife habitat. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. The surface is covered by approximately 85 percent gravel, 3 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones.

(5 to 8 centimeters thick) 

 Bk1--5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through medium roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; 60 percent fine prominent irregular moderately cemented white (10YR 8/1) calcium carbonate nodules with sharp boundaries on bottom of rock fragments; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones; violently effervescent (40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 30 centimeters thick) 

 Bk2--15 to 28 centimeters (6 to 11 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 60 percent medium prominent irregular moderately cemented white (10YR 8/1) calcium carbonate nodules with sharp boundaries on bottom of rock fragments; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; violently effervescent (55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); very abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 25 centimeters thick) 

 Bkqm--28 to 36 centimeters (11 to 14 inches); white (10YR 8/1) very weakly cemented material, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm; brittle; violently effervescent. 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; about 32 kilometers (20 miles) south and (11.2 kilometers) 7 miles east of Indian Springs, Nevada; approximately 0.75 miles directly north of Highway 157, Kyle Canyon Road area; 422 meters (1,386 feet) north and 521 meters (1,710 feet) west of the southwest corner of sec. 24, T. 19 S., R. 57 E.; USGS Angel Peak, NV , 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 36 degrees, 16 minutes, 54.5 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees, 32 minutes, 33 seconds west longitude; UTM 11s, 630896e, 4016189n; NAD83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in late winter and early spring and intermittently moist in the upper part following summer convection storms. The soils have an aridic soil moisture regime that borders on ustic. 

Soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 58 degrees F.). 

Depth to calcic horizon: 5 to 8 centimeters (2 to 3 inches). 
Depth to petrocalcic horizon: 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches). 


Control section: 
Clay content: 7 to 15 percent. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent rock fragments, mainly gravel with 0 to 15 percent cobbles and stones. Approximately 10 to 30 percent of rock fragments are strongly cemented to indurated petrocalcic fragments. 

A horizon: 
Value: 5 or 6 dry. 
Chroma: 2 or 3. 
Texture: Sandy loam or loam. 
Organic matter: 0.25 through 0.75 percent. 
Calcium carbonate equivalence of the fine earth: 40 to 70 percent. 

Bk horizons: 
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3. 
Texture: Sandy loam or loam. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 65 percent, 20 percent of rock fragments are petrocalcic pieces, and 60 percent carbonate films on bottoms of rock fragments in some horizons. 
Organic matter: 0.25 through 0.50 percent. 
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard dry, nonplastic or slightly plastic wet. 
Calcium carbonate equivalence of the fine earth: 40 to 70 percent. 
Secondary lime accumulation: 5 to 20 percent secondary calcium carbonate accumulation in the form of calcium carbonate coats and/or calcium carbonate masses. 

Bkqm horizon: 
Value: 6 through 8 moist. 
Chroma: 1 through 3. 
Cementation class: Very weakly through moderately cemented. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Purob (NV), Spager (UT) and Wamp (NV) series. Purob soils have a typic-aridic soil moisture regime. Spager soils have an aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime. Wamp soils have a strongly cemented through indurated hardpan. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goodwater soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Elevation is 1,420 to 2,200 meters (4,660 to 7,220 feet). The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and occasional summer convection showers. The mean annual precipitation is 228 to 300 millimeters (9 to 12 inches); mean annual air temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C. (51 to 56 degrees F.), and the frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boxspring, Buckspring, Doespring, Janefalls, and Seralin soils. Boxspring soils occur on mountains and are shallow to bedrock. Buckspring, Seralin, and Janefalls occur on mountains and have mollic epipedons. Doespring soils occur on fan remnants at higher elevations. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderate permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the cemented pan. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is blackbrush, Stansbury cliffrose, snakeweed, and Utah juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
