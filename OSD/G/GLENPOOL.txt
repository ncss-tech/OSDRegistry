GLENPOOL SERIES

The Glenpool series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandy wind blown deposits of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on smooth undulating or hummocky, slopes of terraces or on side slopes of terraces where the wind blown material has masked one or more terraces.  They occur in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Siliceous, thermic Psammentic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Glenpool loamy fine sand--forest.    (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable;  moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    E--4 to 41 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sand; weak fine granular structure; loose; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (34 to 54 inches thick)

    Bt--41 to 48 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; clay films bridging sand grains; moderately; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 inches thick)

    E/Bt1--48 to 55 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand; single grained; loose (E); with alternating lamellae of red (2.5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam (Bt1); the lamellae are very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; wavy and discontinuous 1/4 to 3/4 inch thick and 4 to 10 inches apart; the lamellae have clay bridges between the sand grains; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 24 inches thick)

    E/Bt2--55 to 80 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand; single grained; loose (E); with lamellae of yellowish red (5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam (Bt2); the lamellae are weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; wavy and discontinuous 1/4 to 3/4 inch thick and 6 to 15 inches apart; the lamellae have clay bridges between the sand grains; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Tulsa County, Oklahoma; about 4 miles northwest of Bixby; 2,400 feet south and 150 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 33, T. 18 N., R. 13 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Combined thickness of the A horizon and E horizon range from 40 to 60 inches.  Some pedons do not have a continuous Bt in the upper argillic horizon but the combined thickness of lamellae is more than 6 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.

The E part of the E/Bt horizons (E horizon) has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.

The Bt part of the E/Bt horizons (Bt horizon) has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.  This horizon occurs as lamellae up to 1 inch thick and from about 1 to 16 inches apart.  Some pedons have skeletans in the E/Bt horizon that make up less than 5 percent by volume.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The nearly level to moderately steep Glenpool soils are on high terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  They have sandy and loamy sediments of Pleistocene age in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  The climate is moist subhumid to humid; Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 80; average annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches; and the mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to about 63 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Kamie, Karma, and Larton series.  Kamie and Larton are on the same terrace in slightly lower parts of the landscape.  Karma soils are on lower terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for native range.  Some areas are used for tame pasture.  Native vegetation is mostly oaks with an understory of grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  In eastern Oklahoma and possibly Kansas and Texas.  The series is of minor extent.

REMARKS:  Glenpool soils were formerly included with the Eufaula soils.  Soil Interpretation Record: Series      OK0179;  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this Pedon are: Albic horizon - the zone from 4 to 41 inches (The E horizon);  Argillic horizon - the zone from 41 to 48 inches (The Bt horizon).
