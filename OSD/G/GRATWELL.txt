GRATWELL SERIES

The Gratwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite and schist. The Gratwell soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1025 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Flotag (MLRA 6) soils. Flotag soils are formed in basaltic and andesitic ash and mudflow deposits, have ashy textures and buried horizons, and are moderately well drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Gratwell soils are on broadly concave backslopes of mountain slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite and schist. Elevation is 1385 to 2505 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 885 to 1170 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free season is 105 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sherman soils. The Sherman soils are on concave stream terraces and footslopes of drainageways on mountain slopes and are moderately well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is giant sequoia, white fir, sugar pine, incense cedar, and California dogwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
