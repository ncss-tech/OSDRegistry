GOLDHILL SERIES

The Goldhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till or colluvium from mixed geological sources.  The Goldhill soils are on mountains, foothills and terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 40 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goldhill loam--on a 12 percent northwest facing slope at 7,850 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on June 18, 1980, the soil was moist throughout.)

(2 to 6 inches thick)

    BA--3 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8), abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

(3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bt2--11 to 24 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine and medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 15 percent pebbles and 1 percent cobbles; many prominent and distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt3--24 to 33 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many prominent and distinct thick clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk1--33 to 40 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong thick platy structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; lime and silica coatings less than 1 mm. thick on undersides of coarse fragments; 10 percent secondary lime in old root channels; 25 percent manganese stains on ped faces and on coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk2--40 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong thick platy structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; lime and silica coatings less than 1 mm. thick on undersides of coarse fragments; 10 percent secondary lime in old root channels; 25 percent manganese stains on ped faces and on coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Herd series.  Herd soils are dry for 30 to 45 days in late summer, are in a humid climate and have hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goldhill soils are on mountains, foothills and terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 40 percent.  Elevations are 6,900 to 8,800 feet. The soils formed in glacial till and colluvium derived from mixed geologic sources.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual air temperature is 34 to 40 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The frost-free period is 10 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cronks, Dacont, Donkehill, Friedman, Lag, Meegero, Parkay, Resoot, Venum, Zeale, and Zeebar soils.  Cronks, Dacont, Donkehill, Friedman, Lag, Parkay, Resoot, and Zeebar soils are on mountain and foothills and have mollic epipedons.  Meegero and Zeale soils are on fan terraces and foothills and have mollic epipedons and have carbonatic minerology.  Venum soils are on mountains and foothills and have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are dominantly rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, alkali sagebrush, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
