GARIPER SERIES

The Gariper series consist of deep to duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Gariper soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Duric Xeric Petroargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gariper loam -- on a southwest-facing slightly convex slope of 7 percent, in native rangeland at 1,550 meters elevation.  (When described on May 31, 1979, the soil was slightly moist above 56 cm and dry below. Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A1--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine, few medium and coarse roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; 10 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary.       (8 to 20 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 23 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bt--23 to 46 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/3) clay,  dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine, very fine and medium, few coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common pressure faces; 5 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 46 cm thick)

    Btq--46 to 56 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent gravel; few silica pendants on undersides of gravel and peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    2Bkq--56 to 119 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; 25 percent gravel; many silica and calcium carbonate pendants on bottom of rock fragments; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (23 to 64 cm thick)

    2Bkqm--119 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) continuous, strongly cemented duripan, yellowish brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, brittle; 15 percent gravel; strong effervescence; common, medium sized soft masses and seams of calcium carbonates.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acoma, Berdugo, Borda, Bowns, Brent, Chardoton, Gooding, Mahala, Phing, Poall, Reba, Sorf, Spangenburg, and Verdico series.  All of these soils except Berdugo, Gooding and Phing lack secondary silica.  Acoma and Borda soils are deeper than 64 cm to the base of the argillic horizon.  Berdugo and Spangenburg soils lack calcic horizons.  Borda, Reba and Verdico soils are slightly acid or neutral in the argillic horizon.  Bowns, Chardoton and Sorf soils have MAST greater than 10.6 degrees C.  Bowns, Mahala and Verdico soils are moderately deep to lithic or paralithic contacts.  Brent, Chardoton, Gooding and Phing soils have "E" horizons.  Poall soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gariper soils are nearly level to sloping on fan terraces at elevations of 1,100 to 1,620 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 330 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 90 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  There are the Arbidge, Owsel and the competing Gooding series.  Arbidge and Owsel soils have silica cementation above 100 cm and lack abrupt textural changes.  These soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, medium to rapid runoff; slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  Gariper soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 25.
