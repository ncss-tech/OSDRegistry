REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 30 to a depth of 80 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (A, E, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 centimeters (A and E horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 18 to 30 centimeters (E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 114 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The till is Kansan or Nebraskan age.

The matrix colors and the redoximorphic features described in this profile are not believed to be indicative of present day wetness. These colors were not used to determine the classification of this soil. This situation needs additional study.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
