GERDA SERIES

The Gerda series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on fans or flats on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Leptic Torrertic Natrustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Gerda loam, in native pasture. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

 E--0 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium and thick platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

 Btn--2 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate coarse columnar structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots between peds; common very fine tubular pores; many continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (3 to 12 inches)

 Btkny--11 to 19 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) silty clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots between peds; common very fine tubular pores; common discontinuous distinct clay films on faces on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; common fine irregular masses of gypsum; common fine irregular masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 40 inches)

 Bky--19 to 29 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; common fine irregular masses of gypsum; common fine irregular masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 30 inches)

 Bk--29 to 44 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine tubular pores; common fine irregular masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches)

 C--44 to 80 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - fans or flats on uplands

Elevation - 2,000 to 4,000 feet

Slope - 0 to 9 percent

Parent material - alluvium

Climate - cool, with long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 16 inches

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kirby, Kremlin, Maltese, Patent and Scairt soils.  Kirby soils are on hills of uplands.  They have fractured or shattered porcelanite at depths of 11 to 20 inches.  Kremlin and Patent soils are on fans.  They are fine-loamy and do not have a natric horizon.  Maltese and Scairt soils occupy similar landscape positions as the Gerda soils.  Maltese soils have visible salts below a depth of 16 inches and are on micro-highs.  Scairt soils have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.   

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very slow permeability; runoff is negligible to very high depending on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION: The Gerda soils are used as rangeland.  The native vegetation is western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, inland saltgrass, and Nuttall saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are of moderate extent in southwestern North Dakota and possibly northwestern South Dakota and southeastern Montana.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches after mixing the upper 7 inches (E and Btn horizons); natric horizon - the zone from 2 to 19 inches (Btn and Btkny horizons).
