GRAVESUMIT SERIES

The Gravesumit series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Gravesumit soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Onite (NM) and Yucca (NM) series. Both of these soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days, cumulative, between July and September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gravesumit soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are 1,600 to 3,800 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation comes in winter but a significant portion is received between July and September following convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bluepoint, Eastrange, Goldivide, Livefire, and Thermopyl soils. Bluepoint and Livefire soils are on adjacent fan aprons, have a sandy particle-size control section, and do not have an argillic or calcic horizon. Eastrange soils are on convex remnants, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section, and do not have an argillic horizon. Goldivide soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have a calcic horizon. In addition, they have an argillic horizon with an upper boundary beginning at 14 or more inches from the surface. Thermopyl soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low through medium runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability. Sandy substratum phases are recognized with moderately rapid over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gravesumit soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of moderate extent.
