GETCHELL SERIES

The Getchell series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium, over dense glacial till. Getchell soils are on mountain slopes, ridges, and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 2159 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Nutmeg series. The Nutmeg series is very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Getchell soils formed in volcanic ash, colluvium and alpine glacial till. The till was derived from a wide variety of rock. The elevation ranges from 549 to 915 meters. Getchell soils are in a cool marine climate with cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1778 to 2540 mm. The average annual temperature is about 6 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Olomount Oso  Elwell, Hartnit, Potchub, and Verlot soils. Olomount and Oso soils are underlain by a lithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 inches. Potchub and Verlot soils have more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 10 cm of the spodic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; moderate permeability to the dense glacial till and very slow through it. A perched water table is as high as 46 to 91 cm at times from December through April. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for woodland and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is western hemlock, Douglas-fir, Pacific silver fir, and western redcedar, with an understory of western brackenfern, salal, Oregon-grape, trailing blackberry, red huckleberry, devilsclub, lady fern, bunchberry dogwood, blue-leaved huckleberry, salmonberry, longtube twinflower, and western swordfern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West slopes of the Cascade Mountains in northwestern Washington. The series is moderately extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Snohomish County, Washington, 1979. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm
Cambic horizon: 13 to 58 cm
Andic soil properties: 8 to 99 cm
Volcanic glass: from 8 to 99 cm
Redox concentration: 13 to 99 cm
Densic horizon: 99 to 150 cm

07/2013: Updated as part of the SDJR initiative. The units were changed to metric and the format was changed to tabular. Future evaluation needs to be made as to whether or not this soil should be a Spodosol or Andisol. The distribution of soils with and albic horizons needs to be clarified. The nature of cementation in the upper part of the dense glacial till needs to be investigated.  Dry days of 45 to 60 added based on OSD's spatially used adjacent to Getchell.

04/1994: Classification only changed because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy. Fails criteria for spodic because of lack of an albic horizon. Characterization soil sample number S74WA61-2, 4-306-4-313, 84P3814-3816, and 78P0944-78P0945. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a cambic horizon from 2 to 20 inches, and a cemented layer at 36 inches.
