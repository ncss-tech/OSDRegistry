GOOSE LAKE SERIES

The Goose Lake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks with surficial mantles of eolian volcanic ash.  Goose Lake soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goose Lake ashy silt loam--meadow. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; black (N 2/0) ashy silt loam, dark gray (N 4/) dry; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    Btg2--19 to 33 inches; very dark gray (N 3/0) silty clay, dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) dry; strong coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; continuous stress cutans on prisms; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (12 to 18 inches thick)

    Bkg--33 to 42 inches; very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) silty clay, gray (N 5/0) dry; moderate coarse prismatic structure; very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; common threads of secondary carbonates; many stress cutans on prisms; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).  (8 to 15 inches thick)

    BCkg--42 to 62 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; massive, very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Oregon; about 8 miles south of the town of Lakeview; approximately 400 feet east of the southwest corner of section 23, T. 40 S., R. 20 E.; USGS Crane Creek 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 4 minutes 36.0 seconds N. and longitude 120 degrees 20 minutes 7 seconds W., NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soils are wet from late winter through late summer, except where drained.  The soils are dry throughout the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days out of the 120 days following the summer solstice; Seasonal periods of aquic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. (measured).

Depth to base of argillic horizon - 30 to more than 60 inches.

Depth to secondary carbonates - 30 to 50 inches.

Depth to bedrock - More than 60 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goose Lake soils are on lake terraces.  These soils formed in sediments deposits from volcanic rocks such as tuff, rhyolite, and basalt and have surficial mantles of eolian volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,350 to 4,750 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The average July temperature is 65 to 68 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lakeview and Thunderegg soils. These soils lack albic horizons. Lakeview soils also lack Bt horizons and average less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Thunderegg soils have a clayey natric horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow permeability.  Flooding is rare.  Unless drained, a water table is at 1 foot above to 3 feet below the surface from February to August.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Goose Lake soils are used mainly for hay, pasture, and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is spikerush, dock, Baltic rush, and tufted hairgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon and northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,800 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 21.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Modoc County (Alturas Area), California, 1974.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (A and Eg horizons).

Albic horizon - The zone from 6 to 10 inches (Eg horizon).

Mollisol order - The upper 6 inches of the profile (A horizon) meets the requirements for a mollic epipedon, the upper 7 inches of the profile (A horizon and 1 inch of albic horizon (Eg horizon) meets the requirements of a mollic epipedon and the argillic horizon (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons) meets the requirements of a mollic epipedon.

Vitrandic subgroup feature - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (A and Eg horizons).

Argillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 33 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).

Endosaturation - The soil is saturated or moist during the winter and summer and is dry in the fall.
