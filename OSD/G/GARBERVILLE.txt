GARBERVILLE SERIES

The Garberville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. Garberville soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1650 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, thermic Fluventic Haploxerolls

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days after the summer solstice and moist in most or all parts November through May. The soils have a xeric moisture regime. 

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 15 to 18 degrees C. and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 6 degrees C or greater. The soil has a thermic temperature regime.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Garberville soils are on stream terraces or alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. Elevations are 35 to 140 meters. These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2550 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 21 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Parkland (CA) and Grannycreek (CA) soils. Parkland soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features between 50 and 100 centimeters and occur on slightly lower positions on alluvial fans and terraces. Grannycreek soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, are poorly drained, and exist on back slope positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for pasture, hay, orchards, and irrigated vegetable crops. The vegetation is perennial and annual grasses and forbs including oats, soft brome, smooth brome, ryegrass, bristly dogstail grass, foxtail, and medusahead.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt, MLRA 4B. . The series is not extensive.
