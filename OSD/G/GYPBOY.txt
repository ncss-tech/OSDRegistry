GYPBOY SERIES

The Gypboy series consists of very deep, well drained soils  that formed in sandy and silty eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits. Gypboy soils are on hummocks on lake plains and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amboy Crater soils. Amboy Crater soils are on smooth nearly level lake plains and have an electrical conductivity of 17 to 70 dS/m in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gypboy soils are on hummocks on lake plains. These soils formed in sandy and silty eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits. Elevations are 590 to 700 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 5 inches; mean annual air temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 300 to 360 days.
