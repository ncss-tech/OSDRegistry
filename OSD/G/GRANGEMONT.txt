GRANGEMONT SERIES

The Grangemont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and reworked loess with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Grangemont soils are on broad ridges, hills and structural benches on plateaus, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 3 to 45 percent. They have moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, frigid Andic Glossudalfs

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Grangemont soils are on broad ridges, hills, structural benches, and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,600 to 3,800 feet (489 to 1158 meters). Slopes are 3 to 45 percent. These soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. The average annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 50 inches (711 to 1270 mm) and the frost-free period is about 50 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Carlinton, Cavendish, Kauder, Reggear, and Wilkins, series. Carlinton soils are on south and west-facing hills and have xeric moisture regimes. Cavendish soils are on south and west-facing hills at lower elevations and are fine-loamy. Wilkins soils are on flood plains and are somewhat poorly drained. Kauder and Reggear soils are on undulating plateaus and have fragipans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Some areas have been cleared for cultivation. The natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, Myrtle pachystima, beargrass, huckleberry, common snowberry, queencup beadlily, and longtube twinflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Idaho; Grangemont soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.
