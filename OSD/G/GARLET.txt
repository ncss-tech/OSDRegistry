GARLET SERIES

The Garlet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on foot slopes, mountains, and till plains.   Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Garlet stony loam, woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed and undecomposed forest litter.

    E1--2 to 6 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) stony loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to very fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and common coarse roots; 15 percent stones and 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    E2--6 to 21 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine pores; 25 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones, and 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of the E horizons is 12 to 24 inches.)

    Bw/E--21 to 48 inches; B part (60 percent) light brown (7.5YR 6/4), brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; E part (40 percent) pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2), brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; extremely cobbly sandy clay loam; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; ped faces are coated with gray (10YR 6/1) very fine sand; 25 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones, and 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 35 inches thick)

    Bk--48 to 70 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones, and 40 percent gravel; continuous distinct lime coats on underside of rock fragments; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1)

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County (Philipsburg-Drummond area), Montana, 1969.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0176, MT0689, MT0806, MT1195, MT1280.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an albic horizon from the mineral soil surface to 21 inches (E1, E2 horizons); a mixed horizon of cambic and albic materials 21 to 48 inches (Bw/E horizon); a horizon of carbonate accumulation from 48 to 70 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (E2, Bw/E horizons).  Garlet soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
