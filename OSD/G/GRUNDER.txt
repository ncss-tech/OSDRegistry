GRUNDER SERIES

The Grunder series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium from quartzite, non-calcareous sandstone and/or non-calcareous siltstone. Grunder soils are on north and east facing slopes of hills and mountains. Slopes are 10 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Grunder silt loam; forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 inches; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A--3 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 1 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt--12 to 22 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine irregular and few very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along root channels; 1 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

    B/C--22 to 26 inches; 60% brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist, 40% brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) gravelly fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    R--26 inches; non-calcareous yellow sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dra, Monida, Newlands, Primeaux, Rammel, Shotgun, and Tingey series.  Dra soils have calcareous materials at depths between 20 and 32 inches. Monida and Tingey soils are very deep and have horizons with secondary carbonate accumulation. Newlands soils are deep to bedrock. Primeaux soils have 35 to 60 percent gravel in the lower portion of the solum and are in areas that average 14 to 16 inches of annual precipitation. Rammel soils are channery, cobbly or stony in the argillic horizon and have horizons with secondary carbonate accumulation.   Shotgun soils are in areas that average 25 to 30 inches of annual precipitation and were formed on loess covered basalt plains.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - hillslopes and mountain slopes (dominantly north and east aspects)
Elevation - 6,000 to 7,575 feet
Slope - 10 to 50 percent 
Parent material - mixed alluvium from quartzite, non-calcareous sandstone and/or non-calcareous siltstone
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers
Average annual precipitation -  16 to 24 inches
Average annual air temperature - 36 to 41 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Danburn, Richollow, and Swan Flat soils.  Danburn soils are very deep and pachic.  Swan Flat soils are very deep, loamy-skeletal and calcareous throughout.  Richollow soils are shallow to limestone bedrock and calcareous throughout.  Swan Flat and Richollow are in rangeland and lack an O horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Grunder soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is quaking aspen, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, snowberry, serviceberry, chokecherry, pine reedgrass, slender wheatgrass, mountain brome and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. These soils are of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.
