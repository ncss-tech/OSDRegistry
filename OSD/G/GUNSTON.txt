TYPE LOCATION:  Fairfax County, Virginia;  located in a wooded area on Mason Neck National WIldlife Refuge, in the woods 60ft west of Potomac View Blvd and 530ft south southeast of the small parking lot on the western edge of route 600 (Gunston Road) just before if forks into Hallowing Dr. and Potomac View Blvd.  Latitiude 38degrees, 38 minutes, 18 seconds north, and longitude 77 degrees, 8 minutes, and 43 seconds, on the Fort Belvoir topoquadrangle.  NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the top of the Argillic horizon: 15 cm (6 inches)
Depth to the base of the Argillic horizon: 183 cm (72 inches)
Solum Thickness: 25 to 183 cm (10 to 72 inches)
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 183 cm (72 inches)
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: Greater than 183 cm (72 inches), November to May
Rock Fragment content: 0 to 35 percent, by volume, throughout. 
Soil Reaction: moderately acid to extremely acid, except where limed
Note: The clayey Btg horizon or clayey part of the BCg horizon extends to 60 to 90 inches below the surface.  

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 3 to 6. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam. 

The BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, and has few to common iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. 

The Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, has few to many iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less.  In some pedons this horizon does not have a dominant matrix color but has redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red. The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or red are common to many.  Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 35 to 60 percent and silt content is more than 30 percent.  The Bt and Btg horizons are clay, clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam. 

The BCg horizon colors are similar to the Btg horizon.  It is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam. 

The Cg horizon, in addition to the colors of the Btg and BCg horizons, may have hue of 5Y, with value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2, or it is neutral, with value of 5 to 7.  It is stratified sandy, loamy, or clayey sediment.

REMARKS: 

This series was previously mapped as Lenoir.  Lenoir is currently thermic.  Gunston is the mesic counterpart.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon  from a depth of 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches; A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon - from a depth of 30 to 127 cm (12 to 50 inches; Bt and Btg horizons).
