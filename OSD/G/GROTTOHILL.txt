GROTTOHILL SERIES

The Grottohill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. The Grottohill soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters (8 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ima (NM+TX), Mallet (AZ) and Perilla (AZ) series. Ima soils are dry in the soil moisture control section from October to May and are formed from sandstone and shale. Mallet and Perilla soils receive significantly larger amounts of precipitation characteristic of the Sonoran Desert (300 to 400 millimeters, 12 to 16 inches of precipitation). Mallet soils also do not have accumulation of secondary carbonates above 75 centimeters (30 inches) and have greater than 1 percent organic matter in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Grottohill soils are on fan remnants and fan aprons. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid sources. Elevation is 1,340 to 1,585 meters (4,395 to 5,200 feet). The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 millimeters (7 to 9 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees C. (56 to 62 F.) The frost free season is 210 to 270 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rosshorse (T CA), Sagamore (T CA) and Stonekey (T CA) soils. Rosshorse soils have a calcic horizon. Sagamore soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. Stonekey soils are moderately deep to a petocalcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is big galleta, black grama, Joshua tree and Cooper's goldenbush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
