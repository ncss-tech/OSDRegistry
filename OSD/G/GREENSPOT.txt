GREENSPOT SERIES

The Greenspot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic sources. The Greenspot soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Greenspot gravelly loam, on a south-facing, linear, 20 percent slope under Jeffrey pine, black oak, pinyon pine, western juniper and grasses at an elevation of 2,140 meters. The soil surface is covered with a layer of leaf litter.  

    Oi -- 0 to 3 centimeters; slightly decomposed pine needles and leaf litter. (0 to 5 centimeters)

    A -- 3 to 13 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and plastic; common fine roots throughout; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0) abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 centimeters)

    Bw1 -- 13 to 26 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots throughout; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0) abrupt wavy boundary.

    Bw2 -- 26 to 40 centimeters, (10 to 16 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, common fine roots throughout; 3 percent faint clay films; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0) clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 15 to 45 centimeters)

    Cr -- 40 to 59 centimeters; slightly to highly weathered quartz monzonite.

    R -- 59 centimeters; hard, fractured quartz monzonite.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Brader soils: do not have a lithic contact at 50 to 75 centimeters and are derived from sedimentary rock.  
Gapcot soils: do not have a lithic contact at 50 to 75 centimeters and are formed in residuum from sandstone. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: mountains
Landform: mountain side slopes
Slopes: 15 to 30 percent
Parent material: residuum from quartz monzonite
Elevations: 2,000 to 2,225 meters
Climate: subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with some snow. 
Mean annual precipitation: 480 to 620 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.
Frost-free season: 85 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Cariboucreek soils: have an argillic horizon and are on slightly lower positions on alluvial fans.
Cedarpines soils: 50 to 100 centimeters to a paralithic contact and are on similar landscape positions.
Garloaf soils: greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are on lower positions on alluvial fans.
Minnelusa soils: have a petrocalcic horizon and are on lower positions on fan remnants.
Runningsprings soils: have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the paralithic contact.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. Some areas are used locally for homesites. The present vegetation is mainly Jeffrey pine, black oak, pinyon pine, western juniper and grasses.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Inland mountain ranges of Southern California Coastal Plain and Mountains, MLRA 19. These soils are of small extent.
