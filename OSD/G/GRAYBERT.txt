GRAYBERT SERIES

The Graybert series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of recent coarse-silty loess over buried soils that were also formed in loess.  These soils are on terraces in high, dry ancient valleys.  They have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 11 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees  F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Graybert very fine sandy loam on a plane slope of 1 percent in a cultivated field.  The soil was moist to 30 inches and dry below that depth when described.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

   A--8 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

   Bw--10 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; mildly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

   Ab--24 to 38 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; mildly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

   Bwb--38 to 52 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence of lime accumulations within root pores; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

   BCb--52 to 58 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

   C--58 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Custer County, Nebraska; about 5 miles south and 1 mile west of Anselmo; 100 feet south and 792 feet west of the northeast corner, sec. 26, T. 18 N., R. 22 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 14 inches.  The mantle of recent loess over the buried soil ranges from 20 to 34 inches thick.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 14 to 18 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically very fine sandy loam and ranges to include fine sandy loam and loam.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically very fine sandy loam ranging to include loam.

The Ab horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.

The Bwb horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Secondary carbonate is accumulated in root pores.

The BCb horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kenesaw and Lowry series of the same family.  Kenesaw soils are shallower to fine carbonates.  Lowry soils are shallower to fine carbonates and do not have buried horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Graybert soils are on stream terraces and on foot slopes to uplands of high, dry, ancient valleys.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 11 percent.  Surfaces are plane or concave.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of recent reworked coarse-silty soil material that overlies fine-silty soil material.  The range of mean annual temperature is from 46 to 58 degrees F, and the range of mean annual precipitation is from 16 to 26 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hord and Kenesaw soils.  Hord soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine-silty control section and are on similar positions in the landscape.  Kenesaw soils are shallower to carbonates.  They occupy a hummocky landscape with a poorly defined drainage pattern.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is slow to medium.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  About 90 percent of the acreage of these soils is cultivated.  Corn, alfalfa, small grains, grain, and forage sorghums are the principal crops.  Native vegetation is mainly big and little bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, blue grama, western wheatgrass, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nebraska.  The series is not extensive.
