GRASSYPOINT SERIES

The Grassypoint series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very low saturated hydraulic conductivity soils that formed in clayey fluviomarine deposits. These nearly level soils occur on tidal marshes on estuaries. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, nonacid, hyperthermic Sodic Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Grassypoint silty clay loam, on tidal marsh.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ag--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in); dark greenish gray (10Y 4/1) silty clay loam; massive; moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine roots; many dead roots; electrical conductivity of 42.0 dS/m; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (12 to 32 cm [5 to 13 in] thick)            

 Cg1--30 to 67 cm (12 to 26 in); dark gray (N 4/), clay; massive; very sticky, very plastic; common fine roots; 5 percent fine prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; electrical conductivity of 22.0 dS/m by ec meter; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Cg horizons is 48 to 168 cm [19 to 66 in])

 C--112 to 203 cm (44 to 80 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay; massive; very sticky, very plastic; 2 percent fine prominent black (7.5YR 2.5/1) manganese masses; 5 percent coarse prominent gray (5Y 6/1) iron depletions; 15 percent medium prominent gray (5Y 6/1) iron depletions; electrical conductivity of 32.0 dS/m by ec meter; neutral. (42 to 141 cm [17 to 56 in] thick)

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Brazoria County, Texas, 2022. The name is from a geographic area close to the series type location.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Tracosa series. The series was separated based on the red subsoil.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
  Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) 
  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) (Ag horizon) 
  Endosaturation: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) (Cg and 
C layers)

Additional Comments: The mineralogy is based on data from soils with the same texture and parent material.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis, electronic conductivity, and pH tests were performed at the project office on pedon S2021TX0399114.
