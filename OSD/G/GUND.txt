GUND SERIES

The Gund series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from loess, volcanic ash, and mixed rocks over lacustrine deposits.  Gund soils are on lake plains, lake plain terraces, and alluvial flat remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty over clayey, mixed over smectitic, superactive, nonacid, mesic Xerertic Torriorthents

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Consistence:  Soft or slightly hard, dry; slightly sticky or moderately sticky and slightly plastic or moderately plastic, wet.
Effervescence:  Commonly noneffervescent, but is slightly effervescent in some pedons.
Salt and sodium:  These soils are strongly salt and sodium affected, with concentrations decreasing with increasing depth.
Other features:  Some pedons have a thin A2 horizon and/or a 2Cg horizon.

Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.

Segregated gypsum or sodium sulfate salts:  It has few to many crystals in the lower subhorizons; more study is needed to determine gypsum content.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gund soils are on lake plains, lake plain terraces, and alluvial flat remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from loess, volcanic ash, and mixed rocks over lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the McConnel, Ocala, Sonoma, Umberland, and Wendane soils.  McConnel soils are sandy-skeletal.  Ocala and Wendane soils are fine-silty.  Sonoma soils are poorly drained and do not have horizons of silica accumulation.  Umberland soils are fine textured and do not have horizons of silica accumulation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff;  moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity in the strongly contrasting lower part.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 100 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from February through June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Drained phases have the water table at depths between 150 and 180 cm.  Ponding from run-on water is common in some areas.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gund soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, rubber rabbitbrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, basin big sagebrush, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lander County, Nevada, South Part, 1985.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of the Bq1 horizons).
Duric feature - The zone from 10 to 58 cm (Bq1 and Bq2 horizons).
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 90 and 107 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the 2Bw and 2Cy horizons).
Vertic subgroup feature - The zone from the soil surface to 100 cm with total linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more (A, Bq1, Bq2, and 2Bn horizons and part of the 2Cy horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bq2 and 2Bn horizons and part of the 2Cy horizon).

The revision of August 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty over clayey, mixed over smectitic, superactive, nonacid, mesic Oxyaquic Torriorthents based on linear extensibility data in the NASIS database.

Further study of the gypsum and soluble salts in the lower horizons are needed to clarify gypsum content and data on volcanic glass content in the A, Bq1, and Bq2 horizons is needed.
