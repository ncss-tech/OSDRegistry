GRANTSDALE SERIES

The Grantsdale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Grantsdale loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; common fine and medium pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 17 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common fine pores; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk--17 to 32 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    2BCk--32 to 36 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, and nonplastic; few fine roots; thin lime coats on underside of gravel; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    2C--36 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).
