GAIBSON SERIES

The Gaibson series consists of shallow, well drained soils  with moderately slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt, rhyolite and welded rhyolitic tuff. Gaibson soils occur on foothills and canyon sides and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent. The average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gaibson extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam - on a southwest facing slope of 10 percent in rangeland at 5,200 feet elevation. The surface has about 60 percent coarse fragments. When described on September 13, 1989, the soil profile was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine and few medium irregular pores;  55 percent gravel, 10 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

     AB--2 to 5 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

     BA--5 to 13 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, and few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

     Bt--13 to 19 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; soil is pressed between coarse fragments and has no structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine and few fine and medium irregular pores; 75 percent gravel, 15 percent channers; few discontinuous faint clay films on faces between soil and rock fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt, wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

     R--19 inches; highly fractured rhyolite.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Duckhill series.  Duckhill soils are very shallow.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gaibson soils occur on foothills and canyon sides, at elevations of 4,700 to 6,200 feet. Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt, rhyolite and welded rhyolitic tuff. The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer. Average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fergie(T) and Terracecreek(T) soils. Fergie soils are very deep and occur in concave positions and mid slopes. Terracecreek soils are moderately deep and are on mid slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff: moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The dominant vegetation is Low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass. Some Mountain Big sagebrush is found.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This series is of small extent in Southcentral Idaho.
