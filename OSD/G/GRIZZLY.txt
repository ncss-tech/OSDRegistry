GRIZZLY SERIES

The Grizzly series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from igneous rocks on mountains.  They have moderate high or moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Northmound and Ribhill - have less clay and more silt in the argillic horizon and have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 cm (sandstone or quartzite)
Rumblecreek - formed in material derived from glacial till and drift

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  residuum or local colluvium over residuum derived from igneous rocks 
Landform:  hillslopes and broad ridges on mountains

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buska, Citadel, Hisega, Pactola, Vanocker, and Virkula soils.
Buska - formed in colluvium and residuum from metamorphic rocks (schist) high in mica; they occur on similar landscape positions
Citadel - are fine textured and formed in material from limestone; generally they occur on lower parts of the landscape
Hisega - formed in colluvium and residuum from metamorphic rocks (schist) high in mica, and have mollic epipedons; generally they occur on lower parts of the landscape
Pactola - formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist, and typically have less clay in the particle size control section; they occur on similar landscape positions
Vanocker - formed in colluvium and residuum derived from limestone; generally they occur on lower parts of the landscape 
Virkula - contain more silt and formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed sources; generally they occur on lower parts of the landscape 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low to moderately high hydraulic conductivity; runoff is medium to very rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production, recreation wildlife, and  grazing.  Native vegetation is dominantly ponderosa pine with lesser amounts of aspen, birch, and Black Hills spruce.  The understory is shrubs and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Crystalline Area - Igneous physiographic area of the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming; LRR G, MLRA 62.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Soil moisture:  Typic udic 
Albic horizon - 2.5 to 53 cm (E1, E2, and E3 horizons)
Glossic horizon - 53 to 84 cm (Bt/E horizon)
Argillic horizon - 53 to 109 cm (Bt/E and Bt horizons)

The classification of the series is revised to Haplic Glossudalfs, which fits the typical pedon as defined in Soil Taxonomy.
