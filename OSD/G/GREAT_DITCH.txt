GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Belhaven, Cipre, Coree, Engelhard, Flyway, Machapunga and Newholland soils.
Belhaven soils--are in very poorly drained areas on flats, depressions, and flood plains in the Lower Coastal Plain; these soils formed in highly decomposed organic matter underlain by loamy marine deposits
Cipre soils--are on permanently submerged wave-cut platforms and lake beds in the coastal plain; these soils formed in woody organic material underlain by sandy lacustrine deposits.
Coree and Machapunga soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms, permanently submerged lake terraces, and lake beds, these soils formed in coarse-silty and coarse-loamy deposits.
Engelhard soils--are in poorly drained lake-wash rims along Lake Mattamuskeet, these soils formed in sandy lacustrine lake-wash deposits that contain a high content of very fine sand and are underlain by marine or fluvial deposits.  
Flyway soils--are on permanently submerged wave-cut platforms and lake terraces in the coastal plain, these soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits.
Newholland soils--are on very poorly drained broad upland flats and along the outer edges of pocosins or flood plains in the coastal plain; these soils formed in loamy marine and fluvial deposits. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class--Subaqueous (permanently submerged)
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity--Moderately high to high
Soil Moisture Regime--Peraquic

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Most areas are unvegetated and function minimally as littoral and limnic habitat. Recreational use is waterfowl, hunting, and observation; historically, there was extensive fishing and boating. There are no known commercial uses. 
Dominant Vegetation--Isolated clusters of Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) and historically wild celery (Vallisneria americana), sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinate), southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis), and redhead grass (Potamogton perfoliatus).  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Natural lakes and Carolina Bays in the coastal plain of North Carolina and South Carolina.
Region--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s)--153B
Extent--Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hyde County, North Carolina, 2024

REMARKS: 
Great Ditch is derived from the initial seven-mile canal excavated from Lake Mattamuskeet's south end to Wysocking Bay in 1837 by the North Carolina State Literary Board.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022)--

Reduced Matrix--0 to 143 centimeters (0 to 56 inches); soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but undergoes a change in hue or chroma within 30 minutes after the soil material has been exposed to air.
Endosaturation--0 to 143 centimeters (0 to 56 inches) 
Sulfidic materials--64 to 102 centimeters (Cseg horizon, 25 to 40 inches)
Peraquic feature-Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface.
