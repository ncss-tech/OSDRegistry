GOWAN SERIES

The Gowan series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 51 to 102 centimeters of loamy glaciolacustrine deposits and in the underlying sandy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Gowan silt loam on flat of 1 percent, in a cultivated field, on a glacial lake plain, at an elevation of about 400 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 28 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine and moderate granular structure; very friable; common fine and very fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (20 to 33 centimeters thick)

    Btg--28 to 46 centimeters; olive gray (5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; weak very fine angular blocky structure; firm; common fine and very fine roots; few faint grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; common fine prominent olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) and few fine prominent olive (5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 51 centimeters thick)

    Bg--46 to 64 centimeters; olive (5Y 5/3) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and very fine roots; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; common medium faint grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (13 to 51 centimeters thick)

    2C--64 to 203 centimeters; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loamy very fine sand; single grain; friable; few fine faint light gray (10YR 7/1) nodules of calcium carbonate; common fine distinct pale olive (5Y 6/4) Fe depletions, and common fine and medium prominent yellow (10YR 7/8) Fe concentrations; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; St. Louis County, Minnesota, Meadowlands subset; about 1 mile north and 2.5 miles east of Floodwood; located about 2,000 feet south and 1,300 feet west of the northeast corner of section 27, T. 52 N., R. 20 W.; USGS McCarty River topographic quadrangle; latitude 46 degrees 57 minutes 51 seconds N., and longitude 92 degrees 51 minutes 3 seconds W., NAD 83.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--poorly drained--a seasonal high zone of saturation as shallow as 15 centimeters below the surface during the wettest periods of normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the upper loamy glaciolacustrine deposits and 1.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second in the underlying sandy or loamy glaciolacustrine deposits

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay.
