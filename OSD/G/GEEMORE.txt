GEEMORE SERIES

The Geemore series is very deep with a discontinuous cemented layer at 30 to 40 inches.  They are well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Geemore soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow. Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Geemore gravelly loam - on a 3 percent southeast-facing slope in rangeland at 7,200 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on September 1, 1981, the soil was dry to 39 inches and moist below this depth.)

(2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; common faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

(0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bkq--39 to 45 inches; about 75 percent of the horizon consists of discontinuous lime and silica cemented plates, about 1mm thick; material between the plates is white (10YR 8/2) very gravelly clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 45 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    BCk--45 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/2) very gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine interstitial pores; 50 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bickmore, Bluebell, Booneville (T), Keman (T), Kiote, Panin, Parkay, Redbird, Rutherford (T), Tusel, Woodcock, and Woodhurst.  These soils all lack cementation within 40 inches.  Bickmore,  Bluebell, Panin, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils have bedrock at a depth of less than 40 inches. Keman soils have mollic epipedons 30 to 50 inches thick and 18 to 24 percent clay in ther particle-size control section.  Kiote, Parkay, and Woodcock soils have no calcium carbonate in the upper 40 inches and are neutral or more acid.  Tusel are 35 inches or deeper to the base of the argillic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Geemore soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation is 6,800 to 7,500 feet. The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and average annual temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F. Frost-free period is 30 to 60 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arbus, Fandow, Heathcoat, Mountainboy, Wiggleton, and Zeal soils.  Arbus and Fandow soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have ochric epipedons.  Heathcoat soils are on mountains and lack cemented layers. Mountainboy and Wiggleton soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces. Mountainboy soils are shallow to a laminar cap and Wiggleton soils lack cemented layers.  Zeale soils are on mountains and foothills and have carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow and medium runoff; permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 19 inches (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 19 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Calcic horizon - The zone from 19 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bkq, and BCk horizons

Particle-size control section - the argillic horizon 

This soil would classify as Calcic Pachic if such a subgroup were recognized.
