GRECAN SERIES

The Grecan series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, dolomite and conglomerate. These soils are on terraces and hills. Slopes are 4 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Iwica and Siroco series. The Iwica series has a duripan at 107 to 152 cm.  The Siroco series has greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grecan soils are on terraces and hillsides. Elevations are 1798 to 2175 m. Slopes are 4 to 20 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, dolomite and conglomerate. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 381 to 508 mm, much of which falls as snow or spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. Frost-free period is 70 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clegg, Hagenbarth, Hutchley, and Swanpeak soils. Clegg and Hagenbarth soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section and occupy similar landform positions. Hutchley soils are shallow to lithic contact, have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and are on summits and shoulders. Swanpeak soils have a clayey-skeletal particle size control section and occupy similar landform positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Grecan soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, serviceberry, snowberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, and western wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Grecan soils are of limited extent in southeastern Idaho. MLRA 43B.
