GONVICK SERIES

The Gonvick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy glacial till on glacial moraines.  These soils have moderate or moderately slow permeability.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gonvick loam with a slightly convex slope of 2 percent on a ground moraine in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 7 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak very fine granular structure; friable; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

   A--7 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of A horizons is 8 to 16 inches.)

   Bt1--10 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint porous grayish coatings on faces of peds; few faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

   Bt2--16 to 23 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay films on faces of peds; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

   Bt3--23 to 29 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam; few fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) and dark gray (5Y 4/1) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few distinct to prominent black (10YR 2/1) clay films on faces of peds and in old root channels; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 12 to 30 inches.)

   Bw--29 to 60 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few grayish lime segregations; about 5 percent gravel; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Minnesota; about 3 miles north and 5 miles east of Carlos; about 1600 feet west and 100 feet south of northeast corner of Sec. 2, T. 129 N., R. 36 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is 20 to 38 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 2 to 8 percent of the volume of all horizons.  The mollic epipedon ranges in thickness from 8 to 16 inches.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.

The A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  The A horizon typically is neutral, but the range includes slightly acid.  It is loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin E horizon.

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3 in the upper part and hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4 in the lower part.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has either mottles with chroma of 2 or less or has a matrix with chroma of 2 and mottles of higher chroma.  The Bt horizon averages from 22 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 45 percent sand.  The Bt horizon typically is loam or clay loam.  Reaction typically is neutral, but slightly acid in the upper part and slightly alkaline in the lower part is within the range.  Clay films in the Bt horizon are few to many and faint to prominent and have 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

Some pedons have a Bk horizon.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 and it commonly has mottles.  It is loam or clay loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 30 percent.

Some pedons have a C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Knute (T) series.  Knute soils average more than 45 percent sand in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gonvick soils have slightly convex, plane, or slightly concave slopes on glacial moraines. Slope gradients are 1 to 4 percent.  The Gonvick soils formed in calcareous, loamy glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 21 to 25 inches.  Frost-free days range from 100 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cathro, Flom, Parnell, Quam, Seelyeville, and Waukon soils.  Well drained Waukon soils are on higher lying more sloping terrain.  Poorly drained Flom soils are in drainageways and nearby flats.  Very poorly drained Parnell and Quam soils are in depressions.  Those soils are members of a drainage sequence with Gonvick soils.  The very poorly drained Cathro and Seelyeville soils are organic soils in depressions.  Waukon soils do not have mollic epipedons and do not have mottles in the B horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is as high as 2.5 to 4.0 feet at some time from November through June in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Largely used to grow corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay.  Native vegetation is savanna.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West central and northern Minnesota.  Moderately extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 29 inches (Bt horizons); aquic subgroup per low chroma in Bt horizon. 1/28/2011-TYPE LOCATION error corrected.
