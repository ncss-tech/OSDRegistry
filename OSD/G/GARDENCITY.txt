GARDENCITY SERIES

The Gardencity series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils that formed in coarsely stratified sandy and loamy lacustrine or eolian sediments that are high in very fine and fine sand. These soils are on nearly level to convex slopes on glacial lake plains and glacial deltas, some of which have been reworked by wind. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Meeker County, Minnesota, 1991 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap, A and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 86 centimeters (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons);
udic moisture regime. 

A new series (Oxyaquic or Aquic Hapludolls) is needed to represent the moderately well drained phase. Further study is needed for proper taxonomic classification.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area. 2/11/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.
