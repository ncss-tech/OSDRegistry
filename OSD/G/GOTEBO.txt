GOTEBO SERIES

The Gotebo series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous siltstone or mudstone of Permian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep summits and side slopes of ridges on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, thermic Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gotebo loam -- on an east facing convex slope of 6 percent -- rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

     A2--6 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

     Bw--9 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few thin discontinuous strata of siltstone; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 17 inches thick)

     BC--20 to 30 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, firm; common strata of weathered siltstone becoming more laminar with depth; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 22 inches thick)

     Cd--30 to 32 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) weathered calcareous siltstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deepwood, Enterprise and Woodward series in the same family.
Deepwood and Enterprise : These soils are very deep to bedrock and have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the B and C horizons
Woodward : These soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the B and C horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum derived from noncemented calcareous siltstone or mudstone of Permian age.
Landform: very gently sloping to moderately steep summits and side slopes of ridges on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C).
Slope: 1 to 20 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 57 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation range: 22 to 30 inches
Frost-free period: 185 to 230 days
Elevation: 1000 to 2000 feet
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 44

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Burford, Willow, and Vernon series.  
Burford : These soils occur on similar areas, are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock, and have a fine-silty particle-size class.
Willow : These soils occur on lower foot slopes and higher broad flats, are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock, and have a fine-silty particle-size class.
Vernon : These soils occur on lower side slopes and contain more than 35 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Gotebo soils are well drained; Permeability is moderate. Runoff is low on 1 to 5 percent slopes and medium on 5 to 20 percent slopes.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland.  Some of the less sloping areas are cultivated to small grains or grain sorghum.  Native vegetation is mid and tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Plains of Oklahoma and possibly Texas.  The series is of minor extent.
