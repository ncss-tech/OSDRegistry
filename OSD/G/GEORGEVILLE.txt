SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. 
Extent: Extensive

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cabarrus County, North Carolina, 1910.

REMARKS: 
Previous revision 10/2002 by JAK.  Soil horizon depths were updated 10-04-2021 as there was a 1 inch Oe horizon that didn't begin at the soil surface.
The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular. The type location was also moved from Lancaster County, South Carolina to Montgomery County, North Carolina which represents the dominant area as mapped. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 13 centimeters (5 inches) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 107 centimeters (5 to 42 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
