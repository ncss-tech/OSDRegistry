GYPROCKMESA SERIES

The Gyprockmesa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mack, Gypimack, Fruita, and Fruitvale series. Mack soils do not have a gypsic horizon and Gypimack soils have a gypsic horizon above 100 cm. Fruita soils do not have a calcic horizon and Fruitvale soils have clayey substrata. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow and moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Gyprockmesa soils are used for irrigated cropland, fruit orchard production, and urban development. Native vegetation is Indian ricegrass, galleta, shadscale saltbush and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Gyprockmesa soils are of moderate extent in western Colorado. MLRA 34B.
