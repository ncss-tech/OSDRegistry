GREEN BLUFF SERIES

The Green Bluff series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Green Bluff soils are on outwash plains over basalt plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ardenmont, Cobbler, Downeygulch, Enson, Labuck, Micapeak, Quinnamose, and Stapaloop series.  Ardenmont soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Cobbler soils do not have E & Bt horizons (lamella) and have sandy loam and loamy sand substratum textures. Downeygulch soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Enson soils have densic material at 44 inches. Quinnamose soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. Labuck and Micapeak soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Stapaloop soils have fine sandy loam and sandy loam textures in the surface and particle-size control section, a solum 15 to 25 inches thick, and lack lamella.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Green Bluff soils are on outwash plains over basalt plateaus at elevations of 1,800 to 2,500 feet. These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clayton, Kaniksu, Klickson and Speigle soils. Clayton soils have fine sandy loam and sandy loam textures in the surface and in the control section and are on outwash terraces. Kaniksu soils are on outwash terraces and are sandy in the particle-size control section. Klickson and Speigle soils are on steep basalt plateau side slopes and have mollic epipedon and are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for cropland, timber production and homesite development. Cropland uses include small grains, grass, alfalfa, orchards, and truck crops. Potential natural vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, western larch, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, pinegrass and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. MLRA 43A, 44A.  Series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington, 1913. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)

Lamellae - the zone from 7 to 55 inches (E&Bt horizons). Total thickness of the lamellae in the E&Bt horizons is less than 6 inches

Vitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 17 inches (Ap and E&Bt1 horizons)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the E&Bt1, the E&Bt2, and the upper part of the E&Bt3 horizon)

Series reclassified from Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Xerochrepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts 10/01. 

The description for the type location has been revised 03/03 based on revisiting the pedon type location and developing a more complete pedon description.  The series was also reclassified from Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts to Coarse-loamy isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts to reflect the correct temperature regime.  Green Bluff soils are also mapped in Stevens County with similar vegetation.

Green Bluff soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).
