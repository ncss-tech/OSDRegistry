GALLIMORE SERIES

The Gallimore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy outwash and in the underlying sandy outwash. Gallimore soils are on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 18 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Dystrudepts

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashe, Buladean, Cardigan, Charlton, Chestnut, Delaware, Dutchess, Edneyville, Foresthills (T), Greenbelt (T), Hazel, Lordstown, Riverhead, Rixeyville (T), Soco, St. Albans, Stecoah, Steinsburg, and Yalesville series. Ashe, Cardigan, Hazel, Lordstown, Steinsburg, and Yalesville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Buladean, Chestnut, Rixeyville, Soco, and Stecoah soils have a paralithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches). Charlton, Dutchess, Riverhead, and St. Albans soils less than 127 cm (50 inches) to the base of the cambic horizon. Delaware soils do not clay films in the cambic horizon and do not have an E and Bt horizon in the lower part of the series control section. Edneyville soils have mica flakes throughout the soil profile and have rock fragments dominated by granite and gneiss. Foresthills, and Greenbelt soils have a layer of anthrotransported natural soil materials within the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gallimore soils are on backslopes of dissected outwash plains of Illinoian age. The slope gradient commonly is 25 to 45 percent but ranges from 18 to 70 percent. The soils formed in loamy outwash and in the underlying sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.3 degrees C (52 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 152 to 244 meters (500 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chetwynd, Parke, and Pike soils on outwash plains, and the Holton soils on flood plains. The well drained Chetwynd soils have more clay in the upper part of the solum and are typically on higher lying backslopes. The well drained, more silty Parke and Pike soils are on summits and shoulders of dissected outwash plains. The somewhat poorly drained Holton soils are on flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and high or very high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for woodland. A few areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 114B in southern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Owen County, Indiana, 1997.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (A, E horizons).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 137 cm (Bt horizon).

A cambic diagnostic subsurface horizon is recognized rather than an argillic horizon because the clay percentage difference between the overlying eluvial horizon and the underlying diagnostic horizon is less than 3 percent, and most of this soil is not plowed.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for the typical pedon S89IN-119-16 at the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.
