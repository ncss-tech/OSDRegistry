GEELS SERIES

The Geels series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains and outwash plains. These soils formed in sandy deposits and the underlying clayey and loamy material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Geels soils are on lake plains and outwash plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The Geels soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. Elevation is 183 to 488 meters (600 to 1,600 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Graycalm, Perecheney, Allendale, Kinross, Loxley and Dawson soils. The somewhat excessively drained Graycalm soils are on similar or slightly higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Perecheney soils are common associates on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Allendale soils and the poorly drained Kinross soils are on slightly lower areas and drainageways. The very poorly drained Dawson and Loxley soils are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 76 to 107 cm (2.5 to 3.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy horizons and moderately low or low in the clayey horizons. Permeability is rapid in the sandy horizons and slow or very slow in the clayey horizons. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are forested. Native vegetation is second growth northern hardwoods and conifers. Common trees are quaking aspen, red maple, black oak, jack pine, red pine, and black cherry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northern Lower Michigan. The series is of small extent.
