GRAZANE SERIES

The Grazane series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to shale.  Grazane soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from quartz diorite and shale on risers of fan terraces.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bacobi (AZ), Frisite (WY), Griffy (WY), Kiki (NM), Neiber (WY), Papoose (NV), Redlands (CO), Saddle (WY), Starmountain (AZ) and Tijeras (NM) series.  Bacobi soils have less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Kiki soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Neiber and Saddle soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 51 degrees F.  Frisite and Griffy soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June.  Redlands, Starmountain and Tijeras soils are very deep.  Papoose soils are dry in the soil moisture control section during the summer months.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grazane soils are on risers of fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from quartz diorite and residuum derived from interbedded Jurassic shale and sandstone. Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,900 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches about half of which falls as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The remainder falls as gentle rain or snow between December and mid-April.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Blackston soil. Blackston soils are loamy-skeletal and are on treads of fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Grazane soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is galleta, Indian ricegrass, shadscale, sand dropseed and black grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Grazane soils are of small extent on the Blanding Basin portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona and northwest New Mexico.  They may also occur in southeast Utah.  LRR-D; MLRA 35.
