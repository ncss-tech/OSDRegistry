GRAVOIS SERIES

The Gravois series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and pedisediment and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from dolomite.  Permeability is moderate in the Bt horizon and slow in the 2Btx horizon.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Soils in similar families are the Rend and Wrengart soils.  Rend soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Wrengart soils are more than 40 inches to subhorizons with more than 15 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Gravois soils are on convex ridgetops and sideslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and pedisediment, and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from dolomite. The contact of the contrasting material is marked by a gravelly erosional surface. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bardley, Clarksville, Gatewood, Goss, Lebanon, Niangua, and Useful series.  Bardley and Gatewood soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches and are on adjacent side slopes.  Clarksville and Goss soils are gravelly throughout and are on narrower ridgetops and adjacent side slopes.  Lebanon soils have a fragipan and are on similar landscapes.  Niangua soils have a gravelly surface layer, bedrock at 40 to 60 inches, and are on adjacent side slopes.  Useful soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and are on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Permeability is moderate in the Bt horizon and slow in the 2Btx horizon. The saturated hydrolic conductivity is low.  The surface runoff index is high to very high.  A perched water table is present at 1.5 to 3.0 feet from winter to early spring in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of these soils are cleared and used for grass and legume pasture or hay crops. The remainder is in forest. Native vegetation was mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Ozark area (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of Missouri. This series is of moderate extent.
