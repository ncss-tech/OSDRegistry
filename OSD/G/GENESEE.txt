GENESEE SERIES

The Genesee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Genesee silt loam, on a nearly level slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 256 meters (840 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bw1--20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

 Bw2--36 to 61 cm (14 to 24 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam with thin stratification of loam and silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; friable; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 Bw3--61 to 81 cm (24 to 32 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam with thin stratification of loam and silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 25 to 81 cm (10 to 32 inches).]

 C--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) stratified loam, sandy loam, and silt loam; massive; friable; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Fayette County, Indiana; about 1/2 mile northwest of Waterloo; 2,150 feet north and 325 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 32, T. 15 N., R. 13 E.; USGS Brownsville, Indiana topographic quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 42 minutes 23.4 seconds N. and long. 85 degrees 6 minutes 31.2 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 662140 easting and 4396900 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the base of cambic horizon: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages between 18 and 27 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam or loam, but some pedons have thin layers of silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy loam 
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam, silt loam, or sandy loam, and may contain strata of silty clay loam, clay loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy sand, or sand in some pedons; below a depth of 50 inches some pedons are sand or loamy sand
Clay content: averages 10 to 25 percent
Sand content: 45 to 70 percent
Rock fragment content: 0 to 14 percent gravel
Reaction: commonly slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but may be neutral in the upper part

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Gessie series. Gessie soils have carbonates within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Genesee soils are on flood plains along streams in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in alluvium washed mainly from areas of calcareous loamy drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 14 degrees C (47 to 57 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Moderately well drained Eel soils, somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils, and very poorly drained Sloan soils are in a drainage sequence with the Genesee soils and are the most common associates. In some areas the somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are an associate on slightly lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is very low or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum. These soils are subject to flooding at periodic intervals unless protected by a levee.

USE AND VEGETATION: Commonly cleared and used to grow corn and soybeans. The native vegetation is deciduous forest, chiefly of beech, elm, hickory, hackberry, buckeye, sugar maple, and ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Indiana, southern Michigan, and western and central Ohio; mainly in MLRAs 111A and 111D, and of lesser extent in MLRAs 98, 99, 108A, 111B, 114A, 114B, 115A, 120C, 121, and 124. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of large extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Livingston County, New York, 1908.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 81 cm (Bw horizon).

Representative data mapunit for this pedon is the Genesee component of DMU ID 153343 in MO 11.

Gravelly and sandy substratum phases are currently recognized. These phases may become new series when subset surveys with these phases are updated.
