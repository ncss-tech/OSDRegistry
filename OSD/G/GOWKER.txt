GOWKER SERIES

The Gowker series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains of river valleys and dissected plains.  Slope range is 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 1117.6 mm (44 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gowker clay loam - pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Bg1--86 to 112 cm (34 to 44 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay; common fine distinct brown mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few 1-2 mm black concretions; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 36 cm [7 to 14 in] thick)

  Bg2--112 to 152 cm (44 to 60 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam; common fine distinct reddish brown mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few fine 1-2 mm. black concretions; very slightly acid. (Combined thickness of B horizons is 61 to 114 cm [24 to 45 in] thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Arrington,  Bosque, Cannon, Elbon, Gowen, Gowton, Kanebreak and Staser series.  
Arrington soils: have fine-silty control sections.  
Bosque and Gowen soils: are dry for longer periods and have ustic moisture regimes.  
Cannon soils: contain 15 to 30 percent coarse fragments in all horizons and have mixed mineralogy.
Elbon soils: have thinner mollic epipedons and are in a fine family.  Gowton soils: lack slowly permeable clay layers in the control section and have mixed mineralogy. 
Kanebreak soils: are wet for longer periods of time and have aquic moisture regimes. 
Staser soils: contain mica flakes, are moist for longer periods of time, and have mixed mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:    
Parent material: loamy and clayey alluvium 
Landscape: River Valleys and dissected plains
Landform: Floodplains
Slope: mainly less than 1 percent; some are as much as 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 1168 mm (46 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 72
Mean annual air temperature: 20.0 degrees C (68 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kanebreak, Kaufman and Trinity series. 

Kanebreak soils: are wet for longer periods of time.  
Kaufman and Trinity soils: have more than 35 percent clay throughout with a very-fine particle-size class.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: moderately well
Permeability class: slow
Runoff: slow to medium
Flooding: frequent frequency, 1 to 3 or more times annually
USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for pasture or hardwood timber.  Native vegetation is an overstory of cottonwood, sweetgum, green ash, and oak trees with an understory of panicums, Virginia wildrye, sedges, rustyseed paspalums, and switch cane.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mostly in east Texas along streams that contain a mixture of sediments from the Blackland Prairies (MLRA 86) and the Coastal Plain (MLRA 133).  Series is of moderate extent.
