GILSTON SERIES 

The Gilston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Gilston soils are on drainageways.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cadrina, Chalkcliff, Muff, and Walknolls soils.  Cadrina and Walknolls soils are on plateau hillslopes and are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Chalkcliff soils are on fan remnants and have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section.  Muff soils are on benches and have a natric horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low runoff; moderate rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, recreation and mining.  Potential native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, spiny horsebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, shadscale, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, and bluegrass.  This soil has been correlated to the Semidesert Gravelly Sandy Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) - 034XY206UT range site in Utah. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  The series is of moderate extent.  LRR D, MLRA 34.
