GLADWIN SERIES

The Gladwin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains, lake plains, valley trains, deltas, and low beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C (44 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Argic Endoaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Gladwin loamy sand, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 10 cm (4 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loamy sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; about 5 percent medium gravel; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) thick] 

 E--10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the lower portion of this horizon; about 5 percent fine and medium gravel; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [5 to 13 cm (2 to 5 inches) thick]

 Bs--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/3 and 4/4) sand; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 10 percent fine and medium gravel; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary. [10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bt--30 to 51 cm (12 to 20 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine and medium roots; clay bridging between sand grains; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 20 percent fine and medium gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 36 cm (4 to 14 inches) thick]

 BC--51 to 64 cm (20 to 25 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine subangular blocky; very friable; few fine roots; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; common fine distinct pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) iron depletions; about 5 percent fine and medium gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 2C--64 to 203 cm (25 to 80 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) stratified sand, gravelly sand, and very gravelly loamy sand; single grain; loose; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common medium distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) iron depletions; about 45 percent fine and medium gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Otisco and Pequaming series. Otisco and Pequaming soils do not have carbonates above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). In addition, Otisco soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gladwin soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, valley trains, deltas, and low beach ridges. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Gladwin soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial material of Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 660 to 889 mm (26 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.5 to 7.7 degrees C (42 to 46 degrees F). Frost-free period is 80 to 160 days. Elevation is 183 to 366 meters (600 to 1,200 feet).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the East Lake, Epoufette, and Mancelona soils. The somewhat excessively drained Mancelona and poorly drained Epoufette soil are in a drainage sequence with Gladwin soils. The somewhat excessively drained East Lake soils are on higher landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between October and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas are cropped to corn, hay, small grains, and beans and some vegetables. Artificial drainage is needed to successfully grow most crops. A large part is in permanent pasture, forest, or is idle cropland. Native vegetation is northern hardwoods such as quaking aspen, paper birch, sugar maple, with some balsam fir, eastern hemlock, and eastern white pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, 96, and 98 in northern Lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
