GOATHAUNT SERIES

The Goathaunt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over till and colluvium derived from mixed metasedimentary material. These soils are on glacial-valley floors and glacial-valley walls. Slopes are 8 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,475 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, amorphic Typic Haplocryands 

TYPICAL PEDON: Goathaunt stony ashy loam, in coniferous forest. This pedon was described on a 40 percent slope at 1,495 meters elevation.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; slightly decomposed needles forest litter.

    A--5 to 23 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) stony ashy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent channers, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones and 2 percent boulders; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw1--23 to 60 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very channery ashy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium and few coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 30 percent channers and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--60 to 116 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very channery ashy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly plastic and slightly plastic; few fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 45 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

    2C--116 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely channery sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine tubular pores; 50 percent channers, 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2).
