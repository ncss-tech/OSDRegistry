GEARY SERIES

The Geary series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  Geary soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Udic Argiustolls

07/2003 WAW Changed to semi-tabular format, update runoff and reaction terminology, added additional data.

10/17/05 JCR Added metric to the description.

08/2012 DJK Added hillslopes for landform in introduction and geographic setting. Changed MAP from 26 inches to 30 inches. Added elevation to typical pedon. Added quad and lat/long to type location. Added depth to argillic and PSCS weighted averages to RIC. Added soil moisture and temperature statement to RIC. Added ranges for BA and BC in RIC. Added clay and sand content for the other horizons. Added CCE for the BC and C horizons. Changed Avans competing series reason. Under geographic setting, added elevation, dropped the upper MAAT from 58 degrees F to 57, changed MAP from 23 to 31 inches to 26 to 33 inches, and added in frost-free period. Removed Hastings and Wells from geographically associated soils. Under Drainage and Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity, changed runoff to include low and changed Ksat from moderately low to moderately high. Added LRR and MLRA to Distribution and Extent. Added KSSL characterization pedons that have been sampled to additional data. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: A pedon was sampled in the same general area as the type location, the data is listed under NSSL sample numbers 79P01687-79P01693, pedon 79P0325 (79KS169002).  Additional KSSL characterization available for pedons 80NE129001, 81NE059011, 84NE129011, 88KS061137, 89KS061004, 89KS061256, 99KS089011, 00KS027005, 01KS149009, and 06KS027001.
