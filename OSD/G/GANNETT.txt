GANNETT SERIES 

The Gannett series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy over sandy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Gannett mucky peat, frequently ponded, on a less than 1 percent slope in native meadow. (Colors are for moist soil, unless otherwise stated.) 

  Oe--0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky peat; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry, slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) thick) 

  A1--5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches); black (10YR 2/1) loam; dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry, weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine and fine and common medium roots throughout; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

  A2--25 to 81 centimeters (10 to 32 inches); black (10YR 2/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; thin layer of organic material; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, very friable; many very fine and fine and common medium roots throughout; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined A horizon is 46 to 97 centimeters (18 to 38 inches) thick) 

  2Cg1--81 to 104 centimeters (32 to 41 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; single grain; loose; few fine distinct brown (10YR 4/3) moist iron masses on ped interiors; few fine and very fine roots throughout; neutral; clear wavy boundary. 

  2Cg2--104 to 137 centimeters (41 to 54 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) fine sand, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; thin layer of loamy fine sand; single grain; loose; few fine and very fine roots throughout; neutral; clear wavy boundary. 

  2Cg3--137 to 200 centimeters (54 to 79 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; single grain; loose; few fine and very fine roots throughout; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy over sandy eolian deposits, 
Landform: swales on interdunes, 
Landscape: sandhills, 
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent
Elevation: 610 to 1066 meters (2000 to 3500 feet) 
Mean annual precipitation: 41 to 64 centimeters (16 to 25 inches) 
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C. (46 to 50 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cutcomb, Elsmere, Gus, Loup, Marlake, Nenzel, and Valentine soils. 
Cutcomb soils are histosols. 
Elsmere soils are slightly higher on swales on interdunes and are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches). 
Gus soils are on similar swales and are fine-loamy in the particle size control section. 
Marlake soils are in lower depressions on interdunes and are very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface and having ponding up to 61 centimeters (24 inches). 
Nenzel soils are higher on flats and hummocks on interdunes and are moderately well drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 91 centimeters (36 inches).
Valentine soils are on higher dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: Poorly drained or very poorly drained
Runoff: negligent
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high
Ponding frequency: frequent on the very poorly drained soil
Ponding duration: long on the very poorly drained soil with a depth of up to15 centimeters (6 inches)            

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and haying. The rangeland native plant community for the wet subirrigated ecological site (RO65XY023NE) is mostly big bluestem, prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, and yellow indiangrass; for the wetland ecological site (R065XY022NE) is mostly prairie cordgrass, northern reedgrass, sedge, rush, bluejoint, and slender wheatgrass.
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Nebraska Sandhills in Nebraska and South Dakota (LRR G, MLRA 65). The series is of small extent.
