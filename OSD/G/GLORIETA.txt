GLORIETA SERIES

The Glorieta series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Glorieta soils are on footslopes and toeslopes of scarps and hills. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Elledge (AZ) and Rotado (NM) series. Elledge soils are moderately deep. Rotado is moderately deep and formed from eolian material over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glorieta soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of scarps and hills. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altezita (NM), Aliante (NM), Ribera (NM), and Verano (NM) soils. Altezita soils are loamy, very shallow, and occur on beveled summits. Aliante soils have a mollic epipedon and occur on toeslopes and footslopes of undulating plateaus. Ribera soils are moderately deep and are on summits of hills. Verano soils are clayey-skeletal and occur on steep north-facing backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Glorieta soils are used for urban development, cord wood products, livestock grazing, and recreation. Present vegetation is twoneedle pion, Rocky Mountain juniper, and ponderosa pine with an understory of narrow leaf yucca, Gambel oak, muttongrass, needlegrass, and fleabane

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Glorieta soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains physiographic province in north central New Mexico. The MLRA is 70A.

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter. Electrical conductivity was determined by ec meter, 1:1 water. pH was determined by pH meter 1:1 water. Texture was determined by hydrometer method.
