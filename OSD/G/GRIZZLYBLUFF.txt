GRIZZLYBLUFF SERIES

The Grizzlybluff series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Grizzlybluff loam in an area of Grizzlybluff loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes under pasture grasses and clover at an elevation of 32 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on August 12, 1993 the soil was moist throughout.

HB&M; Hydesville Quadrangle (7.5 minute series;) WGS84 Decimal degrees 40.5314444 latitude and -124.0590230 longitude; UTM Zone 10 410306mE, 4487284mN, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in normal years.  The soils have a udic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 12 to 15 degrees C. The average summer soil temperature is about 18 degrees C and the average winter soil temperature is about 9 degrees C. The difference between average summer and winter soil temperatures is about 6 to 9 degrees C.
 
Depth to strongly contrasting particle size class: sandy or sandy-skeletal material ranges from 28 to 76 centimeters 

Endosaturation: The water table is at a depth of 100 to 152 centimeters January through March, falling to below 183 centimeters in April through December.

Particle size control section (weighted average): 
Upper-part clay content: 10 to 18 percent
Lower-part strongly contrasting clay content: 2 to 10 percent
Rock fragments: 2 to 60 percent strongly cemented gravels, 2 to 20 percent strongly cemented cobbles

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Grizzlybluff soils are on flood plains near current or former channel banks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevation is 3 to 35 meters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 centimeters. The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. The mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Russ, Arlynda, Worswick, and Weott soils. All of these soils lack the layer of sandy or sandy-skeletal material. In addition the Arlynda, Worswick and Weott soils are very poorly drained and are in concave or lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately high permeability, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity; infiltrating water may back up at the contact with the sandy or sandy-skeletal material, but will infiltrate into this material when sufficient hydraulic head is established. The soils are occasionally flooded for brief periods from December through February.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for pasture and hay. Nearly all areas of this soil have been cleared. The natural vegetation is estimated as a sparse canopy of red alder, cottonwood, and willow with an understory of blackberry, ferns, and grasses. There may have been scattered Sitka spruce and redwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern California coastal areas. The soils are not extensive. MLRA 4B
