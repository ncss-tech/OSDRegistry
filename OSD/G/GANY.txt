GANY SERIES

The Gany series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced colluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Gany gravelly silt loam in forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed plant material

  Oe--3 to 5 cm; moderately decomposed plant material

  A1--5 to 10 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) extremely gravelly silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 60 percent by gravel, 5 percent  cobbles, 1 percent stones; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt wavy boundary.

  A2--10 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine,  common medium, and many coarse roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

  Bk1--36 to 76 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.

  Bk2--76 to 127 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; 60 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary

  Bkq--127 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; many very fine and common fine irregular pores; 80 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 30 percent fine irregular calcium carbonate masses throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
