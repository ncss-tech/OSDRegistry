GREYS SERIES

The Greys series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium from loess. Greys soils are on hills, fan remnants, terraces, moraines, mountain slopes, and footslopes of mountains. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive Alfic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Greys silt loam, quaking aspen, on a mountain slope with 8 percent slope at an elevation of 1,953 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
