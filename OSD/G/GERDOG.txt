GERDOG SERIES

The Gerdog series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite, tuff, and tuff-breccia.  Gerdog soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gerdog very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 4 percent stones.

Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 17 to 19 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anaud, Bellenmine, Celeridge, Cleavage, Cleavmor, Cropper, Gabica, Gaciba, Genoa, Gidwin, Grandeposit, Granquin, Grosschat, Hawkridge, Hutchley, Loope, Majorsplace, Mascamp, Melling, Pernog, Pernty, Realmcoy, Rozara, Shalcleav, Shalper, Slatter, Tractuff, and Tweener series.

Anaud, Bellenmine, Cleavage, Cleavmor, Cropper, Gaciba, Granquin, Grosschat, Mascamp, Pernty, Shalper, Slatter, Tractuff, and Tweener soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Celeridge, Gabica, Gidwin, Grandeposit, Loope, Majorsplace and Realmcoy soils have lithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm.  Genoa soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Hawkridge soils have mean summer soil temperature of 15 to 17 degrees C.  Hutchley soils have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 28 to 35 percent clay.  Melling soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  Pernog soils are dominated by stones and have more than 27 percent clay in some part of the particle-size control section.  Rozara soils are dominated by fine gravel, have rock fragments that are granitic rocks, and have 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Shalcleav soils are dominated by channers and flagstones.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gerdog soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite, tuff, and tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,985 to 2,535 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Celeridge and Loope soils and the Joecut soil.  Joecut soils are very deep and have umbric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gerdog soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and antelope bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 2,400 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRAs 22A and 26.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 28 cm (A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 28 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 28 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 28 cm (A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).

The revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Lithic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.
