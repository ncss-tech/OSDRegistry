GRANFLAT SERIES

The Granflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash and alluvium with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on outwash terraces and low stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Granflat gravelly ashy sandy loam - forestland, on a 3 percent south southwest-facing slope at an elevation of 2,840 feet. (When described on May 4, 1994 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated. All textures are apparent field textures.) 

         Oe--0 to 1 inch; moderately decomposed needles and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

         A--1 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly ashy sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and large roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick) 

         AB--7 to 10 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

         Bw--10 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (6.8); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick) 

         2C1--16 to 26 inches; multicolored extremely cobbly sand; single grain, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; neutral (7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick) 

         2C2--26 to 61 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly sand; single grain, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (6.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Granflat soils are on outwash terraces and on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed mixed volcanic ash mixed with glacial outwash and alluvium. Elevations are 2,600 to 4,000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches. The mean January temperature is 22 to 26 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F., and the mean annual air temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buttoncreek, Goddard, Lekrem, and Sitdown soils. Buttoncreek soils are on fans and footslopes, are cryic, and have an ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick. Goddard soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments and have a 7 to 14 inch thick lighter colored ash mantle. Lekrem soils are on mountain backslopes and are loamy-skeletal. Sitdown soils are cryic, have a lighter colored ash mantle 7 to 14 inches thick and are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very slow to slow runoff; very rapid permeabilty 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, livestock grazing, and timber production. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, grouse blueberry, longtube twinflower, pachystima, pinegrass, common snowberry, kinnikinnik, and strawberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Okanogan County, Washington. Series is of small extent.
