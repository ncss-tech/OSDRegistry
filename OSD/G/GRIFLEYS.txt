GRIFLEYS SERIES

The Grifleys series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from limestone and quartzite. Grifleys soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grifleys soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. These soils formed from mixed alluvium derived mainly from limestone and quartzite. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,690 to 2,070 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Armespan, Jericho, and Summermute soils. Armespan and Summermute soils have durinodes. Jericho soils have a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:: Well drained, medium runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Grifleys soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The potential vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
