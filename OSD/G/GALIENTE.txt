GALIENTE SERIES

The Galiente series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium with a mantle of loess. Galiente soils are on structural benches and hillsides. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Ultic Palexeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Galiente silt loam- forested, on a 21 percent east-facing slope at an elevation of 720 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures).

 A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

 Bt1--3 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

 2Bt2--11 to 38 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 inches thick)

 2Bt3--38 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; very strongly acid (pH 4.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Klickitat County, Washington; about 2 miles northwest of Lyle, Washington; 2,000 feet south and 375 feet west of the northeast corner of section 28, T.3N., R.12E. (Latitude 45 degrees, 43 minutes, 08 seconds N. and Longitude 121 degrees, 18 minutes, 03 seconds W).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Clay content in the particle-size control section averages from 35 to 55 percent and has a 20 percent absolute increase within a vertical distance of 3 inches. Depth to abrupt textural change is 10 to 20 inches.  Solum thickness is 60 or more inches.
The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry,  2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It has 15 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.
The Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It has 15 to 25 percent clay.   Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.
The 2Bt horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist. Texture is clay or clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Olompali series.
Olompali soils - have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.; and are dry for more than 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.
The Bateman, Melbourne, Sauvola, and Spreckels (T) series have similar classifications.
Bateman soils - have an active mineralogy class; are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice; have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F.
Melbourne soils - have a mixed mineralogy class; are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice; have redox concentrations in the lower part of the argillic horizon.
Sauvola soils - have a mixed mineralogy class; are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days;have redoximorphic features throughout the argillic horizon.
Spreckels soils - have a mixed mineralogy class; are very gravelly in the lower part of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Galiente soils are on structural benches and hillsides at elevations of 600 to 2,800 feet. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. These soils formed in old alluvium with a mantle of loess. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches. The average January temperature is 29 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Balch, Cauley, Gunn, and Van Nostern soils. Balch soils are on flood plains and hillslopes and are loamy-skeletal. Cauley soils are on terraces and are fine-loamy. Gunn soils are on plateaus and benches and are fine-loamy. Van Nostern soils are on plateaus and are moderately deep to basalt.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for timber production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine with an understory of common snowberry, creambush oceanspray, deerbrush ceanothus, western hazel, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington; MLRA 6. The series is of small extent.
