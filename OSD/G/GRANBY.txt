GRANBY SERIES

The Granby series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash or sandy glaciolacustrine deposits on outwash plains, lake plains, and glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Granby loamy sand, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 190 meters above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 25 cm; black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (25 to 38 cm thick) 

    Bg1--25 to 41 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bg2--41 to 81 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; common medium faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) and gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions in the matrix; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 30 to 102 cm.)

    Cg--81 to 203 cm (32 to 80 in); light gray (10YR 7/2) sand; single grain; loose; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and few medium faint gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions in the matrix; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION: Ottawa County, Michigan; about 7 miles west and 1/2 mile south of Allendale; 350 feet east and 400 feet north of the center of sec. 28, T. 7 N., R. 15 W.; USGS Borculo topographic quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees 57 minutes 58.42 seconds N. and long. 86 degrees 5 minutes 28.51 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 574106 easting and 4757467 northing, NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: typically 76 to 100 cm, but ranges from 51 to 132 cm

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gumz, Kentland, Loup, and Maumee series. Gumz soils have a lithologic discontinuity with till in the lower part of the series control section. Kentland soils have an organic layer in the middle part of the series control section. Loup soils are in drier climates that receive less than 720 mm of annual precipitation. Maumee soils have a mollic epipedon that is more than 38 cm thick. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Granby soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, and glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Granby soils formed in sandy outwash or sandy glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 in). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C. Frost-free period is 130 to 210 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chelsea, Gilford, Morocco, Oakville, Plainfield, Pipestone, Spinks, Tedrow, and Watseka soils, and the competing Gumz soils. The excessively drained Chelsea, Plainfield, and Oakville soils and the well drained Spinks soils are on nearby beach ridges and moraines. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Gumz soils are on similar landforms. The somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils are associated with Granby soils at the northern extent of its range and are on swells. The somewhat poorly drained Morocco, Tedrow and Watseka soils are on higher positions on the landscape. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm above the surface to 30 cm below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow small grain, hay, corn, soybeans, small fruits, and vegetables. Some areas are in permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is marsh grasses, reeds, sedges, aspen, oak, silver maple, elm, and eastern white pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Primarily in MLRAs 98 and 99, and to a lesser extent in MLRAs 91B, 95A, 95B, 97, 101, 103, 105, 110, 111B, 111C, 141, 142, and 144A in southern Michigan, northern Indiana, northern Ohio, southern Minnesota, southern Wisconsin, northeastern Illinois and New York. The series is of large extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Oswego County, New York, 1917. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon). 
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features immediately below the mollic epipedon and in all underlying horizons. 

Loamy and gravelly substratum phases with loamy or gravelly textures at depths of 100 to 152 cm  are no longer within the series concept. 

A till substratum phase is presently recognized in Ohio and may become a new series as subsets with this phase are updated. The till substrata is dense, has 27 to 42 percent clay, and occurs at depths of 152 to 200 cm. 
Drained and undrained phases are recognized in Indiana to differentiate between those mapunits that have been artificially drained in order to facilitate crop production and those with natural hydrology.
