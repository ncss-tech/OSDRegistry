GOLDIVIDE SERIES

The Goldivide series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in dominantly granitic alluvium. The Goldivide soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, and fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  On Goldivide complex, 2 to 4 percent slopes at an elevation of 3,090 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered by 30 percent gravel.

    A -- 0 to 2 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; noneffervescent; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    C1 -- 2 to 7 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots throughout; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; noneffervescent; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 15 inches thick)

    C2 -- 7 to 21 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium root throughout; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; noneffervescent; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

    C3 -- 21 to 34 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium root throughout; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; strongly effervescent; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

    2Btkb -- 34 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse and very coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine roots throughout; few very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; many distinct discontinuous clay films throughout; very few fine and medium carbonate threads throughout and few prominent carbonate coats on ped faces; slightly effervescent; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Helendale, Searchlight, Sonoita and Tray series. Sonoita soils receive more rainfall and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the moisture control section between July and October.  Helendale soils are not calcareous above 30 inches and have argillic horizons beginning above 15 inches. Searchlight soils are calcareous throughout. Tray soils are calcareous throughout and have strongly or very strongly alkaline argillic horizons with exchangeable sodium percentages (ESP) of 15 to 30 percent in all parts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Goldivide soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The soils formed in material from dominantly granitic alluvium.  Elevations are 1,600 to 4,200 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Granitepass (T) soils on similar landscape positions. Granitepass soils do not have an argillic horizon within 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low or low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Goldivide soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage, Indian ricegrass, big galleta, range ratany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.
