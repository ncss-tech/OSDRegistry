GRINTER SERIES

The Grinter series consists of very deep, well drained, soils on back slopes and shoulders of uplands. Slope ranges from 3 to 10 percent. These soils formed in sandy and loamy eolian material. Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Chelsea, Coloma, Colonie, Lakin, and Millrock soils. 
Chelsea soils have greater than 50 percent fine sands. 
Coloma soils show greater soil development (Bw horizons).
Colonie soils allow for free carbonates the lower in the profile.
Lakin soils are more acidic throughout the profile.
Millrock have coarse fragments in the profile.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES PROPOSED: Douglas County, Kansas, Stranger Creek Watershed Project, 2007. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters.
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 50 centimeters (A1, A2 and AB horizons). 
Lamellae subgroup: Lamellae within 200 centimeters of the soil surface. (E and Bt1 and E and Bt2 horizons).
Redoximorphic features: In the zone from 192 centimeters to 210 centimeters (2C3 horizon).
Top two horizons meet mollic colors; however, it lacks the organic carbon to meet mollic criteria. 

This soil was formerly included with the Thurman series. The Thurman series has an ustic moisture regime.
