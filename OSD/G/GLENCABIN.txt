GLENCABIN SERIES

The Glencabin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and  colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rock. Glencabin soils are on buttes and hills. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Glencabin gravelly ashy loam--on a 35 percent north-facing slope at 1,465 meters elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described in July 1996, the soil was dry throughout.) 

    A1--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick) 

      A2--13 to 28 cm, brown (10YR 4/3) cobbly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick) 

    2A3--28 to 43 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick) 

     2A4--43 to 64 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick) 

    2R--64 cm; rhyolite bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Oregon; approximately 1,200 feet east and 500 feet south of the northwest corner of section 24, T. 24 S., R. 15 E.; USGS Hogback Butte 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 29 minutes 01 seconds N and longitude 120 degrees 52 minutes 09 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Moist in the moisture control section in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C. 
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 70 cm. 
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact. 
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 20 percent
Rock fragments: 15 to 40 percent in the upper part and 50 to 70 percent in the lower part. Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as rhyolite;
Volcanic glass content: 30 to 60 percent in coarse silt through fine sand fractions.. 

A1 horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist
Organic matter content: 1.0 to 3.0 percent

A2 horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry
Chroma: 2 through 3, dry or moist
Texture: Cobbly ashy sandy loam
Clay content:  10 to 20 percent
Rock fragment content:  15 to 35 percent total with 5 to 20 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones
Organic matter content:  1.0 to 2.0 percent

2A1, 2A2 horizons 
Value: 4 or 5 dry
Chroma: 2 through 3, dry or moist 
Texture:  Extremely cobbly ashy loam, extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam, or very gravelly ashy loamy sand
Clay content:  5 to 20 percent
Rock fragment content:  35 to 80 percent total with 10 to 30 percent gravel, 15 to 50 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent stones
Organic matter content:  1.0 to 1.5 percent
Other features: Some pedons have cambic horizons below the mollic epipedon. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clearline, Fulcrum, Hatrock, Linecreek, Lonigan, and Stines series. 

Clearline soils are deep to lithic contacts. Fulcrum soils have cambic Bt horizons with evidence of illuvial clay accumulation and 18 to 38 cm thick epipedons. Hatrock and Linecreek soils are very deep. Lonigan soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and have calcic horizons. Stines soils are deep and very deep to paralithic contacts and have calcic horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glencabin soils are on buttes and hills. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 1,320 to 1,835 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kunceider, Redslide, and Wegert soils. Kunceider soils are shallow to lithic contacts and have an aridic moisture regime. Redslide soils are loamy-skeletal, have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates, and have an aridic moisture regime. Wegert soils are ashy and have an aridic moisture regime. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to very high surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Glencabin soils are used for livestock grazing. The vegetation is mainly western juniper, mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lake County (Northern Part), Oregon, 2006. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 64 cm (A1, A2, 2A3, and 2A4 horizons). 
Lithic contact - The boundary at 64 cm to underlying hard bedrock (2R layer). 
Particle-size control section and ashy-skeletal substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 64 cm (2A3 and 2A4 horizons and part of the A2 horizon). 

The type location was relocated to its original location during the final field review of Lake County, Oregon, Northern Part in early 2005 as the best representation of the series concept.
