GERBANA SERIES

The Gerbana series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated shale and mudstone. These soils are on sedimentary plains. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Gerbana silty clay, 3 percent slope in nonirrigated cropland (colors are for dry soil unless noted otherwise).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt--6 to 15 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; continuous distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist clay films of faces of peds; common distinct pressure faces; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Btk--15 to 30 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; common distinct pressure faces; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk--30 to 35 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; 10 percent small flat and angular shale chips; disseminated lime; common fine seams and masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--35 to 60 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) semiconsolidated shale and mudstone, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; common seams and masses of gypsum in upper part; strongly effervescent.

SERIES PROPOSED: Meagher County, Montana, 1990. Gerbana is a coined name.

REMARKS: Soil interpretation record: MT1463. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 7 inches, mixed (Ap, Bt horizons); an argillic horizon from 6 to 30 inches (Bt, Btk horizons); a paralithic contact at a depth of 35 inches (Cr horizon). Gerbana soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
