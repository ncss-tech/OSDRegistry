SERIES ESTABLISHED: New London County, Connecticut, 2024.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously mapped as water in the state of Connecticut.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include-
Peraquic feature--The zone from 0 to 200 centimeters has positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 1.74 meters of freshwater).
Particle--size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches) is loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.
Frasiwassents- taxonomic great group--electrical conductivity (EC1:5) is less than 0.6 dS/m throughout.
Ochric epipedon--0 to 62 centimeters (Aseg1, Aseg2, and Aseg3 horizons).
Sulfidic soil materials--within 100 centimeters of the mineral soil surface, 0 to 10 centimeters and 40 to 200 centimeters (Aseg1, Aseg3 and Cseg horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:
This pedon was sampled as S2022CT011105 by the University of Rhode Island. Support pedons used to develop this series are S2022CT001015 and S2022CT001017.
