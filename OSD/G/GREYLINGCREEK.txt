Ekuk soils are somewhat excessively drained, have fluviomarine deposites as parent material, and occur between 0 and 15m (0 and 49 ft) elevation on rises in coast plains.
Grassylake soils are somewhat excessively drained and occur between 0 and 8 m (0 and 26 ft) elevation on coastal plain berms. 
Lituya soils are somewhat excessively drained, have variegated extremely gravelly coarse sand as both the surface and subsurface textures, and occur on fluviomarine terraces.
