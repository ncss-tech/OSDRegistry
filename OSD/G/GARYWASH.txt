GARYWASH SERIES

The Garywash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite. Garywash soils are on fan remnants and slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (about 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 24 degrees C (about 75 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aco(CA), Coolidge(AZ), Laveen(AZ), Rillito(AZ) and Toltec(AZ) series. Coolidge, Laveen, Rillito and Toltec soils are intermittently moist in some part of the the soil moisture control section during July through September. Aco soils have fine sand below 45 to 65 inches and have 1 to 20 percent gravel. Coolidge and Laveen soils average 0 to 15 percent gravel in the control section. Coolidge soils are 14 to 40 inches deep to the top of the calcic horizon. Toltec soils have a calcic horizon that consists of a disintegrated hardpan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Garywash soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granite. Elevations are 300 to 450 meters (about 980 to 1475 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, dry winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (about 3 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 21 to 25 degrees C (about 70 to 77 degrees F), and the frost-free season is 320 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Chemehueviand Snaggletooth soils. Chemehuevi soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. Snaggletooth soils have fine-loamy particle-size control section and an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Garywash soils are used for recreational and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Lower Colorado Desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 31. These soils are of small extent.
