GATERIDGE SERIES

The Gateridge series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to soft sandstone interbedded with shale on hillsides.  They formed in residuum derived dominantly from interbedded shale and sandstone.  Slopes range from 10 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gateridge fine sandy loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

      Oi--0  to 3 inches; slightly decomposed pine needles and other forest litter.

      E--3 to 7 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.8) clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

      Bt--7 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few distinct clay skins on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

      2C--15 to 19 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) clay, red (2.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; neutral (pH 6.8). (0 to 6 inches thick)

      3Cr--19 to 60 inches; soft, noncalcareous yellowish brown sandstone interbedded with soft, noncalcareous red shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Natrona County, Wyoming; on pine ridge in the NE corner of the county; 1,850 feet north and 2,220 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 22, T. 40 N., R. 77 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly ironstone and sandstone channers and flagstones.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and 30 to 60 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has 40 to 55 percent clay with less than 25 percent more clay than the overlying Bt horizon. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The Cr is soft sandstone interbedded with soft shale.  It may contain a few ironstone fragments.  It is frequently more than 10 feet thick.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gateridge soils are on steep hillsides.  Elevation is 5,800 to 6,200 feet.  Slopes range from 10 to 45 percent.  They formed in residuum derived dominantly from noncalcareous sandstone and shale.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches and is supplemented by heavy snowpack in most areas.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cushman, Forkwood, Shingle and Taluse soils.  These soils are on adjacent slopes of lower elevations.  They have warmer temperatures and are dryer. Cushman soils are moderately deep.  Forkwood soils are deep.  Shingle and Taluse soils do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff;  moderate permeability above the C horizon and slow permeability in the C and Cr horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine with an understory of Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Wyoming.  The series is of small extent.
