GUADALUPE SERIES

The Guadalupe series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, moderately coarse textured alluvium of recent deposition.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping floodplain of deeply incised stream channels in the Southern High Plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Fluventic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Guadalupe fine sandy loam, on a nearly level floodplain, 0.2 percent slope, in cropland at an elevation of about 713 meters (2,340 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A--13 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common medium to fine pores; common wormcasts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons is 13 to 46 cm)

    Bw1--30 to 63 cm (12 to 25 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few wormcasts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (23 to 55 cm thick)

    Bw2--63 to 76 cm (25 to 30 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common fine and medium pores; common wormcasts; few films and filaments of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw3--76 to 97 cm (30 to 38 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few thin strata of fine sandy loam; few very fine to medium pores; few wormcasts; few films and filaments of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

    C1--97 to 114 cm (38 to 45 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loamy fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grained; loose; few strata of fine sandy loam; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (53 to l00 cm thick)

    C2--114 to 203 cm (45 to 80 inches); very pale brown (10YR 8/4) loamy fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; common distinct yellowish brown mottles; single grained; loose; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Hemphill County, Texas; 0.4 kilometers (0.25 mile) southeast and east on county road from Red Deer Creek bridge on the west edge of the town of Canadian, then 18 meters (60 feet) north of the county road into field; Latitude: 35 degrees, 54 minutes, 30 seconds N; Longitude: 100 degrees, 23 minutes, 52 seconds W; Canadian West, Texas USGS quad; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 190 but less than 220 days, cumulative, in normal years. July through August and December through February are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through June. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 16 to 18 degrees C (59 to 65 degrees F).
Solum thickness: 76 to 150 cm (30 to 60 in).
Particle-size control section: 5 to 18 percent silicate clay.

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam or loam
Effervescence: none or slight 
Reaction: moderately alkaline

Bw horizons:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 8, 3 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam in lower part
Effervescence: slight to strong 
Reaction: moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 8, 3 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam (darker buried layers and thin layers 
of clay loam occur in some pedons)
Effervescence: slight to strong
Reaction: moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the competing Hawley series.  Similar soils include the Bippus, Lincoln, Sprone, and Spur, Yahola series.
Hawley series: moist in the control section for longer periods.
Bippus and Sprone series: have a mollic epipedon and 18 to 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.
Spur: have a mollic epipedon and are moist in the control section for longer periods.
Lincoln and Yahola series: are moist in the control section for longer periods and do not have a cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous, moderately coarse textured alluvium of recent deposition.
Landform: floodplain of deeply incised stream channels.
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 15 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 559 mm (17 to 23 in).
Frost-free period: 180 to 220 days.
Elevation: 670 to 1,143 meters (2,200 to 3,200 ft).
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 25 to 36.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Bippus and Sprone soils and the Likes, Mobeetie, and Texroy series. 
Bippus and Sprone soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Likes soils: are on higher landscape positions and do not have a cambic horizon.
Mobeetie soils: are on higher landscape positions and do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon.
Texroy soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions and have 18 to 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderately rapid permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 2 percent slopes.  These soils are rarely to frequently flooded for very brief periods during the spring and summer months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing with some areas cultivated to bermudagrass, weeping lovegrass, winter wheat, and forage sorghums.  Native vegetation is tall grasses with a small percent of trees, mainly eastern cottonwood and tamarisk. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Bottomland (R-077EY065TX) ecological site in MLRA-77E.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E in LRR H) northwest Texas and possibly northeastern New Mexico.  The series is of minor extent.
