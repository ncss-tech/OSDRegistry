GRUVER SERIES

The Gruver series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping eolian plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 inches), and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Paleustolls

Dumas, Oslo, Perryton, Sherm, and Texline soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Conlen soils: are on summit slopes along draws and have carbonatic mineralogy.
Dalhart and Dallam soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions and have an ochric epipedon.
Hansford, Knoblaw, and Lautz soils: are on the floor of playa basins and are intermittently ponded and have a linear extensibility of more than 6 cm to a depth of 100 cm.
Plack soils: are on landscape positions adjacent to draws and have a petrocalcic horizon.
Sunray soils: are on plains and summit slopes along draws and have 18 to 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section and less than 15 percent (by weight) fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderately slow permeability.  Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated with grain sorghum, winter wheat, and corn the main crops.  Climax vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few mid grasses and includes blue grama and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem, and prairie clover.  This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland (R-077AY001TX) ecological site in MLRA-77A.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A in LRR H) of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.  The series is moderately extensive.
