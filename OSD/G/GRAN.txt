GRAN SERIES

The Gran series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium-colluvium. Gran soils are on pediments, hillslopes and mountain slopes with gradients of 1 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gran very gravelly sandy loam-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; 55 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt--1 to 12 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/8) extremely gravelly coarse sandy clay, red (2.5YR 5/8) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky, hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; common pressure faces; 85 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual irregular boundary. (7 to 16 inches thick)

    2Crt--12 to 36 inches; partially weathered granitic rock (grus), few very fine roots; common thin clay films coating bedrock and in fractures; gradual irregular boundary. (12 to 24 inches thick)

    2R--36 inches; granitic rock.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Granolite (AZ)series. The Granolite soils formed in slope alluvium derived from volcanic and metamorphic rock and have accumulations of calcium carbonate.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gran soils are on pediments, hillslopes and mountain slopes and have gradients of 1 to 65 percent. They formed in alluvium-colluvium weathered from granite and to some extent from rhyolite, andesite, latite and diorite. Elevation is 1,800 to 4,000 feet. The climate is warm and semi-arid continental. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain. Mean annual temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 220 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dixaleta and Wickenburg soils. Dixaleta and Wickenburg soils lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing. The native vegetation is brittlebush, creosotebush, cholla, ironwood, paloverde, mesquite, jojoba, catclaw, triangle bursage, yucca, barrel cactus, saguaro cactus, ocotillo, and graythorn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South Central Arizona. The series is moderately extensive. MLRA is 40.
