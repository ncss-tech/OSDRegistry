GOLDMOUNTAIN SERIES

The Goldmountain series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary sources. The Goldmountain soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 480 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goldmountain very gravelly loam, on an east facing, linear, 25 percent slope under western juniper, pinyon pine, Jeffrey pine, Wyoming big sage and annual grasses at an elevation of 2,091 meters (6,860 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by approximately 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles. 

    A1 -- 0 to 18 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2 -- 18 to 31 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots throughout; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 25 to 75 centimeters)

    Bw1 -- 31 to 41 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots throughout; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2 -- 41 to 51 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots throughout; 60 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of B horizons is 20 to 60 centimeters)

    R -- 51 centimeters; metasedimentary rock.
