GOODCREEK SERIES


The Goodcreek series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from surrounding uplands.  These loamy soils are on flood plains and of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B and 78C).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.

Cottonwood, Knoco, Talpa and Vernon series:  These soils occur on higher upland areas and are less than 40 inches to bedrock.
Kingco, Nipsum, and Quanah series:  These very deep soils are on uplands. 
Wheatwood series:  This soil occurs on flood plains and has an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Moderate permeability.  Runoff is negligible.  This soil is rarely to frequently flooded for very brief periods.   

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for both cropland and rangeland.  The main crops are small grains, cotton, and sorghums.  Native vegetation is blue grama, buffalograss, sideoats grama, western wheatgrass, sand bluestem, and Texas wintergrass.  Mesquite, lotebush, redberry juniper, and prickly pear cactus are common invaders.
