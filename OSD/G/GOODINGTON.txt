GOODINGTON SERIES



The Goodington series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed

in loess over residuum from basalt.  Goodington soils are on basalt

plains and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  Permeability is very slow.

The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average

annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Palexerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Goodington silt loam on a 4 percent slope at an

elevation of 5,300 feet in rangeland.  When described June 14, 1954 the

soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise

noted).

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly

hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots;

many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5

to 8 inches thick)



    A2--6 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6);

clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)



    BA--10 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) silty clay loam, dark brown

firm, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; many fine tubular pores;

pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt coatings on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH

6.4) abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)



    Bt1--12 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay, dark brown

(7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, very

firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; many fine tubular

pores; many slickensides present on ped faces; slightly acid (pH 6.2);

clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)



    Bt2--18 to 26 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay, dark brown

(7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard;

very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common fine

tubular pores; continuous thick clay films on all ped faces; neutral

(pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)



    Bt3--26 to 34 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark brown

(7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard,

very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common fine

tubular pores; continuous moderately thick clay films on all ped faces;

moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches

thick)



    Bk--34 to 56 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark

brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very

hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine tubular pores

nearly continuous pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) lime coating on ped faces

and in pores; strongly effervescent; (20 percent calcium carbonate)

moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 26 inches

thick)



    R--56 inches; hard lime-covered basalt bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bridgecreek, Deer Creek, Harkers,

Lacrol, Mohocken, Norcan, and Rands series.  Bridgecreek and Mohocken

have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Deer Creek and

Harkers have more than 15 percent coarse fragments in the argillic.

Lacrol series is greater than 60 inches deep to the base of the

argillic horizon.  Norcan soils are redder than 7.5YR.  Rands soils do

not have a calcic horizon.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goodington soils are on basalt plains.  Slopes

range from 2 to 20 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,200

feet.  The soil formed in loess over residuum from basalt.  The average

annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow

and early spring rain.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 45

degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Manard, Muldoon, and

Peevywell soils.  Manard soils have a duripan and bedrock at 20 to 40

inches.  Muldoon soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Peevywell

soils are moderately deep to a duripan.  Manard soils occur on the same

landscape.  Muldoon and Peevywell soils occur on fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow to medium runoff; very

slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland and some irrigated

pasture.  Vegetation is Mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass,

Idaho fescue, Nevada bluegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  This series is

inextensive.
