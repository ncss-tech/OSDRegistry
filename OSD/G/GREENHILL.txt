GREENHILL SERIES

The Greenhill series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in deep, sandy, eolian sediments on barrier islands.  These soils are on undulating to strongly rolling foredunes and stabilized back-island dune fields.  These soils are subject to rare flooding by high storm surge from strong tropical storms.  Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Hyperthermic, uncoated Ustic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Greenhill fine sand--on a south facing, convex, 8 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 51 meters (20 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Padre and Panam soils: occur on lower, convex landforms on low stabilized dunes on barrier flats.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained.  Permeability is rapid.  Runoff is very low and negligible for slopes less than 5 percent.  The soil is rarely flooded for very brief periods by high storm surge during strong tropical storms.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily as wildlife habitat and for recreation.  Native vegetation consists mostly of mid to tall grasses and forbs such as bitter panicum, seaoats uniola, seacoast bluestem, camphorweed and partridge pea.  The ecological site is Coastal Dunes, PE 31-44 (R150BY714TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B in LRR T) on barrier islands along the lower Gulf Coast of Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kleberg County, Texas; 2007.  The name is from a USGS benchmark on Padre Island National Seashore.

REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included in the Galveston series or mapped as the miscellaneous area - Coastal Dunes.  The series is separated based primarily on the difference in soil moisture regime and sand mineralogy.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in). (A1 and A2 horizons)
Particle-size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (A2 and C1 horizons)
Masses of oxidized iron: 152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in). (C3 horizon) 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Characterization data from the type location (S03TX-273-001).  TAMU reference sample data for pH, salinity, sodicity and mineralogy on pedons S01TX-273-006 and S01TX-273-007.  Particle-size analysis on 4 pedons and salinity and sodicity tests on 7 pedons at the soil survey project office.
