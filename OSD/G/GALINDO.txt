GALINDO SERIES

The Galindo series consists of very deep soils that formed in stratified clayey and loamy alluvium. Galindo soils are on flood plains of the Rio Grande. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 71 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, calcareous, hyperthermic Ustertic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Galindo clay-cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    Ap--0 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; very slightly saline; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    C1--12 to 29 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium tubular roots; few fine tubular pores; non-saline; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    2C2--29 to 48 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; non-saline; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.  (10 to 40 inches thick)

    2C3--48 to 80 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, loose, non-sticky and non-plastic, few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescence; moderately alkaline.

USGS Quadrangle: Presidio West, TX. Latitude: 29 degrees, 35 minutes, 39.24 seconds North; Longitude: 104 degrees, 26 minutes, 5.10 seconds West; NAD 83. UTM coordinates: 554738 m E, 3273958 m N; Zone 13.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Galindo soils are on the flood plain of the Rio Grande at an elevation of 1,800 to 3,995 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent, but are dominantly 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in stratified clayey and loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Castolon (TX), Lomapelona (TX), and Vicente (TX) series. None of these soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size control section. Castolon soils are in a fine-silty textural family. Lomapelona soils are in a coarse-loamy textural family. Vicente soils are in a coarse-silty textural family. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is slow to moderately slow. Runoff is medium on slopes less than 1 percent and high on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and irrigated cultivated crops and pastures. Cotton, alfalfa, and grains are common irrigated crops. Desert Shrubland vegetative zone. The vegetation consists of creosotebush, prickly pear, salt cedar, and palo verde.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Texas. MLRA 42. This soil is of minor extent.
