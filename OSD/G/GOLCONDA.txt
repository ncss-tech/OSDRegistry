GOLCONDA SERIES

The Golconda series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a mantle of loess high in volcanic ash. The Golconda soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

(10 to 50 cm thick)

    Bqk--91 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/4) weakly silica-carbonate cemented very gravelly loamy coarse sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 55 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Dalzell series. Dalzell soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 13 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Golconda soils are on fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a mantle of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,280 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adelaide, Blackhawk, Dun Glen, Misad, Oxcorel, and Tenabo soils.  Adelaide, Blackhawk, Dun Glen, and Misad soils do not have a natric horizon.  Dun Glen, Misad, and Oxcorel soils do not have a duripan.  Tenabo soils have a duripan within a depth of 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 24, 25.
