GUELPH SERIES

The Guelph series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Guelph loam, on a 3 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable about 2 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches) thick]

 B/E--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam (Bt); common distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; occupies about 80 percent of the horizon surrounded by or penetrated by tongues of brown (10YR 5/3) loam (E); weak fine and medium subangular structure; friable; about 2 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline; clear irregular boundary. [5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bt--30 to 58 cm (12 to 23 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 2 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) thick]

 C--58 to 152 cm (23 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; massive; firm; about 5 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Tuscola County, Michigan; about 1 mile east of the town of Cass City; 1,120 feet east and 300 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 29, T. 14 N., R. 11 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 inches)

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, silt loam, or sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 2 to 10 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

E horizon, when present, and E part of the B/E horizon:
Amount: 15 to 30 percent E material present in the B/E horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, silt loam, or sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 2 to 10 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Bt part of the B/E horizon and Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam
Clay content: 25 to 35 percent
Rock fragment content: 2 to 10 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Bk horizon, where present, or C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam or clay loam
Rock fragment content: 2 to 10 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hortonville and Waymor series. The differentiae separating Hortonville series from Guelph series is unclear. Typically, the Hortonville soils have a redder hue in the Bt horizon but the range overlaps. Additional study will be needed to determine if these series can be separated and on what criteria. Waymor soils are deeper than 64 cm (25 inches) to carbonates. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Guelph soils occur typically on ground moraines and end moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients range from 2 to 35 percent with dominant slopes of 3 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Londo, Marlette, and Parkhill soils. The somewhat poorly drained Londo and the poorly drained Parkhill soils are in a drainage sequence with Guelph soils. Marlette soils, which are deeper to carbonates, are in association with Guelph soils in some areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained or moderately well drained. The moderately well drained phase has a seasonal high water at depths of 76 to 183 cm (2.5 to 6.0 feet) below the surface between December and April in normal year. Potential for surface runoff is medium to very high depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are under cultivation. Corn, beans, wheat, and grass-legume hay are the principal crops. The more sloping areas are generally pasture or hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 98, and 99 in the thumb area of Michigan. The series is of large extent.
