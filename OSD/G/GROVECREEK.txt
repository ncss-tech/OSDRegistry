GROVECREEK SERIES

The Grovecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on eroded fan remnants, landslides and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Grovecreek loam, in forest land (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Bt1--7 to 43 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 15 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 2 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 45 cm thick)

    Bt2--43 to 90 cm; red (2.5YR 5/6) clay, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 35 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 50 cm thick)

    Btk--90 to 110 cm; red (2.5YR 5/6) clay, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; 2 percent prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 15 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 2 percent threadlike calcium carbonate masses in matrix, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate in matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

    Bk--110 to 200 cm; red (2.5YR 5/6) clay, red (2.5YR 5/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 25 percent calcium carbonate masses in matrix and 15 percent threadlike carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).
