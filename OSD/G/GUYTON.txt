GUYTON SERIES

The Guyton series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in thick loamy sediments.  These soils are on Coastal Plain local stream flood plains and in depressional areas on late Pleistocene age terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F)
