MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Potter County, Pennsylvania, 2008.

REMARKS: Germania soils were previously established in Potter County, Pennsylvania and were placed on the inactive list. They were previously unclassified to new taxonomy and no official series description was on record. This OSD is to reestablish the Germania series within its original concept.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 cm (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 210 cm (Bt and 2Btb horizons)
Oxyaquic conditions - the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within
the upper 100 cm of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation for 30 or more cumulative days during the year
Lithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 103 cm
Series control section - the zone from 0 to 122 cm
