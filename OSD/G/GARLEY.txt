GARLEY SERIES

The Garley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Garley soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.  The Cirac, Eghelm, Gilco, Glenton, Ives, Juva, Neskai, Thoroughfare and Yelives series are similar but have a superactive CEC class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sedimentary rock
Landform:  lower stream terraces
Slopes:  0 to 4 6 percent
Elevation:  1,219 to 1,829 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 11.7 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  15.2 to 22.9 cm
Precipitation pattern:  peak periods fromWettest months are  July to October and has even distribution throughout the remainder of the year
driest months are December and June
Frost-free period:  120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Green River, Glenton, Toddler, and Chipeta series.  The Green River soils have a water table at 20 to 60 inches in depth, and are under Fremont cCottonwoods.  The Glenton soils have less salinity and sodiocity and are under basin big sagebrush.  The Toddler soils are fine-loamy and are under black greasewood.  The Chipeta soils are shallow to weathered shale and are on shale hills upslope under mat saltbush.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Wwell drained, low or very low runoff, moderate permeability, rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of March to October.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is black greasewood, alkali sacaton, bottlebrush squirreltail and galleta.  These soils are correlated to Alkali Flat (Black Greasewood) and Alkali Bottom (Alkali Sacaton) ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah; LRR D, MLRA 34B; moderate extent.  About 11,200 acres (4560 hectares) in Emery Area, Utah.
