GOLDEAGLE SERIES

The Goldeagle series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from stratified layers of sandstone, siltstone, or shale. They are on dissected terrace sideslopes of 30 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Colusa County, California; Approximately 8.5 miles southwest of Williams CA, 2200 feet  east and 600 feet south of the northeast corner of section 19, T. 14 N., R. 3 W., 39 degrees 3 minutes 20 seconds N latitude, 122 degrees 13 minutes 50 seconds W longitude, USGS Cortina Creek CA Quadrangle.  

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic contact of soft siltstone, sandstone or shale is 40 to 80 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees F. and the soil is above 47 degrees F. the entire year. The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 31 and is moist in some or all parts from November 1 to May 31. The weighted average clay content of the particle size control section, the top 20 inches of the argillic horizon, is 36 percent clay.

The A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3 or 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 2.5Y 4/2. Some soils have moist values of 3 within in the top 3 inches of the horizon. Texture is sandy clay loam. The clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.

The Bt and Btk horizons have dry color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4 or 4/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4 or 4/6. Texture is clay loam or clay. The clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Carbonates may occur in the lower part.

The Ck horizons have  dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2,  5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7.5YR 4/4 or 2.5Y 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 4/4 or 2.5Y 4/3. Texture is sandy loam or loam. The clay content ranges from 15 to 27 percent. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. 

The Cr material underlying this soil is weathered from soft sandstone, siltstone or shale. 
 
COMPETING SERIES: These are the Artois, Francisquito and Los Banos soils. Artois soils have mottles in the A horizon. Francisquito soils are slight to moderately acid throughout the profile. Los Banos soils are slightly to moderately alkaline in the A horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goldeagle soils mainly occur on dissected terrace backslopes of 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 350 to 1000 feet. The soils have formed in material weathered from stratified layers of sandstone, siltstone or shale. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches. Mean January temperature is 43 degrees F and the mean July temperature is 76 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 58 to 60 degrees F. The frost-free season is 185 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Positas, Dibble and Balcom soils. Positas soils have mollic epipedons. Dibble soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Balcom soils lack argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high and very high runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used as annual rangeland and upland wildlife habitat. The vegetation is soft chess, wild oats, filaree and other annual grasses and forbs along with blue oaks, manzanita, chamise and scattered Foothill pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils occur in the Coast Range foothills of southwestern Colusa County and are not extensive. MLRA 15.
