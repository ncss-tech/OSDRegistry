GARWIN SERIES

The Garwin series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on slightly concave heads of upland drainageways, interfluves on dissected till plains, and treads on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 107 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and Bg4 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

The differences between Sable and Garwin series need further study.
