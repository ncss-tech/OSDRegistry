GOOSEL SERIES

The Goosel series consists of moderately deep over duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks influenced by loess and volcanic ash.  The Goosel soils are on summits and side slopes of volcanic flowrock plateaus and rock pediments.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goosel silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Bqkm--64 to 66 cm; pink (7.5YR 8/4) indurated duripan; massive; 1 to 5 mm thick silica and carbonate laminae; violently effervescent.  (1 to 23 cm thick)

  R--66 cm; unweathered basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Humboldt County, Nevada; approximately 21 miles northeast of Paradise Valley in an unsectioned area of T.43 N., R.42 E.; USGS Whiskey Springs 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 36 minutes 47 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 11 minutes 02 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.6130556 latitude, -117.1838889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, usually dry from July through late October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to indurated duripan: 50 to 90 cm.
Depth to bedrock; 53 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 60 percent.
Rock fragments:  5 to 15 percent; thin subhorizons with up to 35 percent gravel and cobbles are in some pedons.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.
Other features:  Color value and chroma of 5/3 dry and 3/3 moist are limited to the upper 8 cm of the epipedon.

Bt horizons
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Structure:  Prismatic, angular blocky or subangular blocky.
Texture:  Clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.
Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard, dry.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Bqk horizons
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam.
Clay content:  12 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 50 percent, mainly gravel.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or is massive.
Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard, dry.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Cementation:  Continuous brittle matrix or 10 to 60 percent durinodes or strongly cemented discontinuous plates.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dewrust and Hunnton series. 

 Hunnton soils lack bedrock within 150 cm.  Dewrust soils contain 15 to 25 percent rock fragments, lack bedrock within 150 cm and have annual soil temperatures of 13 to 14 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goosel soils are on summits and side slopes of volcanic flowrock plateaus and rock pediments. These soils formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks influenced by loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boger, Burrita and Puett series.  Boger and Puett soils lack argillic horizons.  In addition, Boger soils are shallow to duripans, and Puett soils are shallow over soft rock.  Burrita soils have clayey-skeletal control sections and are shallow to hard bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; Slow to medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 25.
