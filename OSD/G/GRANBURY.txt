GRANBURY SERIES

The Granbury series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey slope alluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone of Cretaceous age. These  gently sloping soils occur on crests of low ridges on hills. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 801 mm (31.5 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17.6 degrees C (64 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Hood County, Texas; 2020. The name "Granbury" comes from the city of Granbury in Hood County, Texas.

REMARKS: 
The series was formerly included in the Lindy series. The series was separated based on the presence of an abrupt textural change and surface texture.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 17 to 59 cm (7 to 23 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 17 cm (0 to 7 in) (Ap horizon)
Abrupt textural change: 17 cm (7 in)
Argillic horizon: 17 to 59 cm (7 to 23 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Redox concentrations: 17 to 59 (7 to 23 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Lithic contact: 59 cm (23 in) (top of 2R layer)
Lithologic discontinuity: 59 cm (23 in) (2R layer)
