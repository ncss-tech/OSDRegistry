GLENBAR SERIES 

The Glenbar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified stream alluvium.  Glenbar soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, hyperthermic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Glenbar clay loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ap--0 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 16 inches thick) 

    C1--15 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common worm casts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 30 inches thick) 

    C2--27 to 48 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) stratified silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few common fine mycelia-like veins of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 12 inches thick) 

    C3--48 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few fine mycelia-like veins of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick) 

TYPE LOCATION:  Maricopa County, Arizona; about 2640 feet northeast of Tolleson, and 160 feet north of canal along west boundary of field; 1980 feet south and 2402 feet west of the northeast corner of section 3, R. 1 E., T. 1 N.  Latitude of 33 degrees, 27 minutes, 31 seconds N., Longitude of 112 degrees, 14 minutes, 48 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section in July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature - 72 to 78 degrees F. 

Calcium Carbonate - Disseminated or as thin filaments; slightly to violently effervescent 

Reaction - Slightly to very strongly alkaline

Salinity - Nonsaline to strongly saline

Sodicity - Nonsodic to strongly sodic

Organic matter - Less than 1 percent decreasing irregularly with depth

A horizon
Value:  5, 6 or 7 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2, 3 or 4, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5, 6 or 7 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, dry or moist
Texture:  stratified clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, silt loam (averages 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section); some pedons have thin strata of contrasting textures
Gypsum:  occurs as crystals between strata in some pedons

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pimer (AZ) series.  Pimer soils contain more than 1 percent organic matter to depths of 20 to 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Glenbar soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in stratified stream alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevations range from 230 feet below sea level to 2500 feet above sea level.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches.  Precipitation falls as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.  The mean annual air temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Antho, Estrella, Gadsden, Gilman, Mohall and Vint soils.  Antho and Gilman soils are coarse-loamy.  Estrella soils have buried argillic horizons.  Gadsden soils are fine textured.  Mohall soils have argillic horizons.  Vint soils are sandy. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to slow runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and where irrigated, for cultivated crops and pastures.  Alfalfa, cotton, grain and vegetables are common irrigated crops.  Vegetation is creosotebush, mesquite, paloverde, ironwood, salt cedar, cacti, annual weeds and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Arizona.  Glenbar soils are extensive.  Total extent is about 327,000 acres.  MLRA is 40.
