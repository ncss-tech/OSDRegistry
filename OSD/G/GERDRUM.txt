GERDRUM SERIES

The Gerdrum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or glacialfluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, till plains, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0286, MT0766.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 4 inches (A, E horizons); natric horizon - from 10 to 22 inches (Btn1, Btn2, Btkn horizons); horizons of accumulations of lime and/or gypsum and other salts (Btkn, Bknyz1, Bknyz2, 2Bknyz horizons); particle-size control section - from the top of the argillic horizon to 22 inches (Btn1, Btn2, Btkn horizons).  Gerdrum soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
