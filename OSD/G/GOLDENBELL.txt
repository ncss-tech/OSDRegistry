COMPETING SERIES: These are the Comobabi (AZ), Kenalduma (CA) and Sal (AZ) series. Comobabi and Sal soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative from July to September. In addition, Sal soils are saline throughout. Kenalduma soils are usually dry in the soil moisture control section and are never moist for 10 or more days, cumulative, from July to September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goldenbell soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and gneiss with an eolian influence. Elevations are 150 to 850 meters (490 to 2,790 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Descent, Rainbowsend, Oldale and Carrizo soils. Descent soils are on adjacent ballenas and more steeply sloping, convex fan remnants. Descent soils are sandy-skeletal throughout the particle-size control section. Rainbowsend and Oldale soils are also on fan remnants. Rainbowsend soils do not have an argillic horizon and are shallow to an indurated pan. Oldale soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and do not have a duripan. Carrizo soils are on adjacent alluvial fans and drainageways, do not have any diagnostic horizons and are sandy-skeletal throughout the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low to low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the duripan, low saturated hydraulic conductivity within the duripan and high saturated hydraulic conductivity below the duripan.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Goldenbell soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly sparse creosote bush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
