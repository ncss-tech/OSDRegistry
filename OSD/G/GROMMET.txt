GROMMET SERIES


The Grommet series are well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources. Grommet soils are on alluvial fans and inset fans. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 410 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Grommet, on a 4 percent slope under in a maintained lawn at an elevation of 87 meters. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 ^A1--0 to 15 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

 A2--15 to 45 centimeters; loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; massive; friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); moderately compacted; clear wavy boundary.

 C1--45 to 95 centimeters; loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; massive; friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular and many very fine interstitial pores; 2 percent slate gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary.

 C2--95 to 190 centimeters; loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; massive; friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; 2 percent slate gravel; neutral (pH 7.3).

TYPE LOCATION: Los Angeles County, California, Westwood Recreation Center, Los Angeles City Parks.  Near Ventura Avenue in southern block of park between several anthropogenic mounds. 34 degrees, 3 minutes, 13 seconds North latitude and 118 degrees, 26 minutes, 41 seconds West longitude, WGS84 - U.S.G.S Quad: Beverly Hills.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:	The soil becomes moist below a depth of about 30 centimeters some time from October to December and remains moist in some part between depths of about 30 to 90 centimeters until April or May.
Mean annual soil temperature: 16 to 19 degrees C (60 to 66 degrees F). The soil temperature usually does not go below 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).
