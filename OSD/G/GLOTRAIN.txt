GLOTRAIN SERIES

The Glotrain series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash and minor amounts of limestone. Glotrain soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Glotrain gravelly coarse sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 20 percent gravel. Lithology of the gravel is welded tuff and some limestone.

(8 to 13 cm thick) 

 Btk1--10 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; common faint clay films bridging sand grains; common (2 percent) secondary calcium carbonate masses throughout; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.

 Btk2--30 to 66 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common faint clay films bridging sand grains; 25 percent gravel; many (25 percent) secondary calcium carbonate masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (13 to 40 cm thick) 

 2Bk1--66 to 102 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel; common (5 percent) secondary calcium carbonate coats around rock fragments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (30 to 64 cm thick) 

 2Bk2--102 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) stratified very gravelly loamy coarse sand and coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; common (5 percent) secondary calcium carbonate coats around rock fragments; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5). 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; approximately 0.75 miles northeast of Put Back Spring and 50 feet west of dirt road in Garden Valley; about 700 feet north and 2,250 feet east of the southwest corner of section 26, T. 2 N., R. 58 E.; USGS Water Gap West 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 00 minutes 07 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 25 minutes 48 seconds W; longitude; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.00194444 latitude, -115.43000 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to summer convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 13 degrees C.
Depth to argillic horizon: 8 to 13 cm.
Thickness of the argillic horizon: 25 to 64 cm.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent in the material less than 2 mm. 
Volcanic glass content: 5 to 25 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction.
Other features: The estimated product of the ammonium extractable aluminum plus half the iron times 60 plus the volcanic glass is 20 to 30.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brinkerhoff, Chacoan, Delp, Enos, Granshaw, Mayqueen, Shiprock, Wallson, and Woolsey series. 
Brinkerhoff soils have secondary gypsum between 50 and 75 cm. 
Chacoan soils are moderately deep over sandstone. 
Delp soils have argillic horizon consisting of lamellae within a sandy matrix.
Enos soils are moderately deep over sandstone. 
Granshaw soils have rock fragments with granitic lithology and do not receive summer moisture. 
Mayqueen soils have sandy C horizons below argillic horizons with 5YR or 7.5YR hue. 
Shiprock soils are nongravelly and have argillic horizons with 5YR or 7.5YR hue. 
Wallson soils 0 to 15 percent gravel throughout. 
Woolsey soils do not receive summer moisture and have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glotrain soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff with a component of volcanic ash, and minor amounts of limestone. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,300 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost free period is 110 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Koyen, Colval, and Slaw series.
Koyen soils do not have argillic horizons. Colval soils occur on basin floors, have argillic horizons with 27 to 35 percent clay and have durinodes.
Slaw soils occur on basin floors and do not have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Glotrain soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes shadscale, winterfat, fourwing saltbush, and Indian ricegrass. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R029XY017NV, Loamy 5-8 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 29.
