GRANDEPOSIT SERIES

The Grandeposit series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum from quartzite and slate. The Grandeposit soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argixerolls
