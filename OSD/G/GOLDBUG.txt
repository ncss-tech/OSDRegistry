GOLDBUG SERIES

The Goldbug series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Goldbug soils are on mountain slopes and hillslopes, and sideslopes of valleys and mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 508 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goldbug very stony fine sandy loam, on a southeast facing, simple, 15 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,121 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on July 1, 1985.

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed organic material of needles, leaves, and roots. (0 to 8 cm thick) 

    E1--3 to 25 cm; pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) very stony fine sandy loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and  nonplastic; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble, 30 percent stones; many fine and  medium roots; few fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    E2--25 to 53 cm; pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) very stony fine sandy loam, pinkish gray  (5YR 6/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and  nonplastic; 5 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble, 20 percent stones; many medium and fine roots; few fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the E horizons is 15 to 56 cm) 

    B/E--53 to 74 cm; (70 percent Bt) light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) stony sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; and (30 percent E) light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) stony fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds of B part; 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble, 15 percent stones; few medium and fine roots; few fine pores; neutral (6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt--74 to 155 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) stony clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; few fine roots; 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8).
