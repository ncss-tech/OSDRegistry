GAMBOGY SERIES

The Gambogy series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium mainly from granitic rock sources. Gambogy soils are on alluvial fans and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Bolfar series. Bolfar soils have segregated carbonates in the A and B horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gambogy soils are on alluvial fans and floodplains with slopes of 0 to 2 percent. They formed in mixed alluvium mainly from granitic rock sources. Elevations range from 190 to 270 feet. The climate is semi-arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 8 inches. The mean annual temperature is 63 to 66 degrees F. The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Biggriz (T), Colpien (T), Hanford and Nord series. All these soils lack aquic moisture regimes. In addition, Biggriz and Hanford soils lack mollic epipedons and Nord and Hanford soils have coarse-loamy families. Also, Colpien soils lack stratification.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; negligible to low runoff; moderately slow permeability. This soil is considered to be drained because of dams and reservoirs in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, pumping from the water table, and filling and leveling of sloughs in the vicinity.  Current depth to water table is greater than 60 inches.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for irrigated cropland growing cotton, alfalfa and grains. It is also used for dairy and cattle production and building site development.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The southern part of the San Joaquin valley.  The soil is not extensive.  MLRA 17.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Tulare County, Western Part Soil Survey, California, 1999.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon -- the zone from the surface to a depth of about 28 inches. (Ap1, Ap2, Ap3, Btg1 horizons)

The Lakeside series in Kings County will be reclassified to be a competing series. The Lakeside, drained soil from Kings County that matches with Tulare County will be changed to Gambogy, drained.
