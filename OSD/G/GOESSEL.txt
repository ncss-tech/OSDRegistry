GOESSEL SERIES

The Goessel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium over loamy alluvium.  Goessel soils are on paleoterraces on river valleys in Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters (32 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).

Updated the classification, competing series and placed in semitab format.  LRM 03/01

JLG 1/2012 Updated to meet MO 5 Soil Technical Note-1 (Revision 3); 
Conversion from English to metric; added the following: longitude and latitude and clay and sand percents to typical pedon, particle-size control section, sand and clay ranges in characteristics, elevation, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Land Resource Region, Major Land Resource Area, Taxonomic Version, precipitation pattern, a couple of diagnostic features, soil moisture, and additional data; divided out upper and lower AC horizons based on lab data for typical pedon.

DJK 05/2014 Revisited and redescribed the type location with new horizonation (Bss, BC, 2C). Updated RIC for new horizonation including redox, EC, gypsum, rock fragments in 2C, and reaction. Changed classification to Udic Haplusterts. Updated competing series for new classification. Changed parent material to clayey alluvium over loamy alluvium.  Changed landform to paleoterrace on river valley based on visiting type location and examining maps and data of area Goessel is mapped. Edited climate data. Added saturation statement to Drainage and Ksat section. Edited diagnostic horizons and features in remarks section for new description. Added gilgai statement. Added KSSL data to additional data section. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Data from typical pedon is from Kansas State University Characterization Laboratory, Manhattan, Kansas; pedon ID 77KS113001. KSSL data available for pedons 59KS015001 and 59KS015002.
