GRANEROS SERIES

The Graneros series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from shale and siltstone.  Graneros soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Graneros gravelly loam, on a south facing, convex, 15 percent slope in mixed conifers at an elevation of 9,880 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 19, 1986 the soil was moist from 0 to 27 inches.  The surface is covered by 5 percent stones.

    Oi--0 to 1 inches; slightly decomposed plant material. 

    A--1 to 3 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    E--3 to 7 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt/E--7 to 13 inches; 60 percent light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; 40 percent light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common thin patchy clay films on faces of peds (Bt); 25 percent gravel; slightly acid pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--13 to 23 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--23 to 32 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and very pale brown (10YR 7/4) parachannery silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; common patchy distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent siltstone parafragments; slightly acid pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 15 to 25 inches thick)

    Cr--32 to 43 inches; soft shale and siltstone.
