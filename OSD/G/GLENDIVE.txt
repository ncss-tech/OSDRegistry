GLENDIVE SERIES 

The Glendive series consists of very deep, moderately well or well drained soils that formed in stratified loamy calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aridic Ustifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Glendive loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    C1--5 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

    C2--10 to 16 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual smooth boundary. 

    C3--16 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam that consists of thin layers of loam, sandy loam and loamy fine sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots grading to few in lower part; common fine pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landforms - flood plains, stream terraces, drainageways. 

Elevation - 1,900 to 5,000 feet. Range elevation to 6000 feet in MLRA 44.

Slope - 0 to 8 percent. 

Parent material - stratified loamy calcareous alluvium. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; hot, dry summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 16 inches, most of which falls in the spring and early summer. 

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F. Range mean annual air temperature to 38 degrees in MLRA 44.

Frost-free period - 90 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hanly, Havre, and Lonna soils.  Hanly and Havre soils are on similar landscapes as the Glendive soils.  Hanly is sandy and Havre is fine-loamy.  Lonna soils are on alluvial fans and terraces above the Glendive soils and are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well or well drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Glendive soils are used mainly for irrigated crops and for pasture.  The potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, thickspike wheatgrass, needleandthread, green needlegrass, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Glendive series is extensive throughout the plains area of Montana.  It is also in the states of North Dakota, Colorado, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0066, MT0185, MT0470, MT0810, MT0817, MT0862, MT0864, MT0872.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  dark colored surface - from 0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon); ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap, C1 horizons); soil horizons that are calcareous - from the soil surface to 60 inches (Ap, C1, C2, C3 horizons); particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (C2, C3 horizons).  Glendive soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
