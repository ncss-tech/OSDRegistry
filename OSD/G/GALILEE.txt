GALILEE SERIES

 The Galilee series is a member of the clayey, mixed, thermic
family of Typic Hapludults.  These soils have grayish brown fine sandy loam A horizons, yellowish red to reddish brown clay B21t
and B22t horizons, reddish brown sandy clay loam B23t horizons,
and mottled yellowish red and brown sandy clay loam B3 horizons on weakly cemented sandstone C horizons.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludults

 TYPICAL PEDON:  Galilee fine sandy loam - forested.
         (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

A1   --  0-8 inches, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam; massive and weak subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine pores; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

     B21t --  8-19 inches, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; few fine pores;
thick continuous dark clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

     B22t --  19-26 inches, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay; moderate medium and coarse blocky  structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots;  few fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid;
gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

     B23t --  26-32 inches, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy clay
loam; moderate coarse blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly
sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse roots; common
fine pores; thin continuous clay films; very strongly acid;
gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 13 inches thick)

     B3   --  32-38 inches, mottled yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and
brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; moderate coarse blocky
structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse roots; common fine pores; peds have thin
continuous clay films of slightly darker color; very strongly
acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

Cr    --  38-50 inches, stratified, weakly cemented sandstone interbedded with mottled reddish  brown (5YR 5/4) and brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/2) fine sandy loam; massive; hard; sandstone can be cut
with spade; very strongly acid.

 TYPE LOCATION:  Walker County, Texas; from the intersection of
Texas Highway 19 and Farm Road 247 in Huntsville, Texas, 10.6
miles north-northwest on Farm Road 247; then east 3.1 miles; then north 2.0 miles and northwest 1000 feet in woods.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact with weakly or strongly cemented sandstone, clay shale, or siltstone.

The A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark brown (10YR 2/2), pale brown (10YR
6/3), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  It ranges from slightly acid
to very strongly acid.

The B21t and B22t horizons are reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/8), brown
(7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4), or red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8).  The
B22t horizon has none to common mottles of red, yellowish red, reddish yellow, brownish yellow, or pale brown.  The B21t and B22t horizons are clay or clay loam and range from medium acid to very strongly acid.

The B23t and B3 horizons are reddish brown to strong brown,
ranging to mottled red, brown, or yellow.  They range from sandy
clay loam to clay and from medium acid to very  strongly acid.

The Cr layer ranges from weakly cemented to strongly cemented sandstone, clay shale, or shaly clay with platy rock structure.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the
Albertville, Arriola, Arundel, Carnasaw, Cuthbert, Enders,
Gritney, Kirvin, Luverne, McQueen, Remlap, Rosenwall, Sweatman, Tatum, Townley, Vance, and Williamsville series.  Albertville, Carnasaw, Enders, Gritney, Kirvin, McQueen, Remlap, Tatum, Vance,
and Williamsville soils lack bedrock within 40 inches of the
surface.  Arriola and Rosenwall soils have gray mottles that are indicative of wetness and in addition, Arriola soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent.  Arundel soils have B2t
horizons of 10YR hues.  Cuthbert soils contain mica flakes and ironstone fragments.  Luverne and Sweatman soils contain mica
flakes.  Townley soils have 5 to 20 percent shale fragments in the B2t horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Galilee soils are on uplands.  Slope gradients are mainly 5 to 15 percent but range up to 20 percent.  The soil
formed in clayey shales, shaly clay, and sandstones of the
Manning, Wellborn, and Yegua Formations.  The climate is subhumid.  The mean annual temperature at the type location is about 68
degrees F., mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E index is about 70.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Arriola and Rosenwall series, and the Gomery and Goreen series.  Gomery
soils have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick and loamy B2t horizons.  Goreen soils are wet in the moisture control section
for longer periods and have gray B2t horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly in forest, with a small acreage in pasture.  Native vegetation consists of an overstory of loblolly
and shortleaf pine, red oak, and post oak, with an understory of eastern little bluestem, indiangrass, longleaf uniola, purpletop,
and low panicums.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Texas.  Series is of small extent.
