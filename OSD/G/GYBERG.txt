GYBERG SERIES

The Gyberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium from sandstone.  These soils are on pediments and have slopes of 3 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gyberg loamy fine sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Bk1--21 to 31 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; many coarse soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (9 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk2--31 to 44 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common medium soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 15 inches thick)

    Cdk--44 to 60 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; common coarse seams of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Yavapai County, Arizona; located about 775 feet north and 930 feet west of the southeast corner of Section 5; T. 15 N., R. 4 E.; 34 degrees, 43 minutes, 10.8 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees, 56 minutes, 31.1 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature:  62 to 65 degrees F.

Clay content: Averages 5 to 18 percent in the particle-size control section

Rock fragments:  Averages less than 5 percent in the particle-size control section

Depth to calcic horizon:  21 to 30 inches

Depth to Cd horizon: 44 to 55 inches

Chroma:  4 through 6, dry or moist
Organic matter:  0.5 to 1 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 25 percent

Cdk horizon
Dense sediments that are intergrades between soft sediments (C material) and soft bedrock (Cr material).  These naturally compacted sediments have been subjected to a slow reduction in volume and increase in density from deep water loading in the geologic past.  These materials easily break down in water and roots can penetrate when moist.  They are root restrictive when dry.
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist
Organic matter: 0.1 to 0.2 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 2 to 25 percent
Texture: loamy fine sand

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Berwolf (TX) series. Berwolf soils formed in sandy sediments (primarily) from weathered sedimentary rocks (redbeds) of Triassic age on the western High Plains of Texas (MLRA 70E) and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gyberg soils are on pediments and have slopes of 3 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and alluvium from sandstone of the Verde Formation.  Elevation ranges from 3,300 to 4,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bilgray, Fetch and Pagesprings soils.  Bilgray soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Pagesprings soils are very shallow to limestone and are loamy-skeletal.  Fetch soils are very shallow to hard sandstone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gyberg soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mesquite, mimosa, threeawn, sand dropseed, tobosa, black grama and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Arizona.  This series is of small extent.  MLRA is 38.  The name is derived from nearby Gyberg Ranch.
