GOLSUM SERIES

The Golsum series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Golsum soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Calciargidic Argixerolls

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring, dry late June through October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 40 cm, includes the Bt1 horizon.

Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Clay content: 18 to 30 percent
Texture: Very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Carstump and Cronks series.

Carstump soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Cronks soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Golsum soils are rock pediments, hills, and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Graley, Pernty, and Sumine soils.  Graley soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Pernty soils are loamy-skeletal and shallow to lithic contacts.  Sumine soils are loamy-skeletal and moderately deep to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Golsum soils are used rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Idaho fescue, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, phlox, balsamroot, hawksbeard, buckwheat, daisy, and penstemon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 24, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 25.
