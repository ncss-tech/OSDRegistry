GOLDBLUFFS SERIES

The Goldbluffs series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial and beach deposits derived from mixed sources. Goldbluffs soils are on narrow ridges on hillslopes and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1780 millimeters (70 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: At this time there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goldbluffs soils occur on narrow ridges on hillslopes. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6 to 309 meters (15 to 1010 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial and beach deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 280 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ossagon and Squashan soils . Ossagon soils are fine-loamy with argillic horizons. The Ossagon soils are on hill slopes. The Squashan soils have argillic horizons and are in similar locations. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity over high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber and is used for recreation, wildlife and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of redwood, Douglas-fir, western hemlock, tanoak, and California huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
