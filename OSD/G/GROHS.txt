GROHS SERIES

The Grohs series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Grohs soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

The soil was dry to 14 inches and slightly moist below 14 inches, when it was described on September 23, 1998.)  The soil surface is covered by a one inch layer of undecomposed or slightly decomposed pine needles and twigs.

TYPE LOCATION:  Klamath County, Oregon; about 2 miles south of Brady Butte, 50 feet south of the State Line Road, and 200 feet east of the telephone repeater road; 400 feet north and 1,500 feet west of the southeast corner of section 23, T. 41 S., R. 14.5 E.; USGS Sagebrush Butte 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 59 minutes 40 seconds north latitude and 121 degrees 1 minute 22 seconds west longitude, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist in winter and spring and dry in summer and fall; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Mean annual soil temperature - 47 to 49 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - 60 to 62 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 20 to 28 inches, includes all subdivisions of the argillic horizon, except for the Bt3 horizon in some pedons.

Argillic horizon thickness - 14 to 28 inches.

Depth to base of the argillic horizon - 20 to 36 inches.

Depth to bedrock - 20 to 36 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic material below the contact is weathered basalt.  Hard, unweathered basalt bedrock is typically within 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adaboi (T), Denbar, Deshler, Deter, Deterson, Esperanza, Jacknife, Medford, Mindego, Nebeker, and Patburn series.  Adaboi, Deter, Deterson, Jacknife, Medford, Nebeker, and Patburn soils are very deep.  Deshler soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have paralithic material of siltstone or consolidated lacustrine deposits.  Denbar and Esperanza soils are deep to duripans.  Mindego soils are deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grohs soils are on hills.  They occur in plateau landscapes.  These soils formed in loess and residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 4,700 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., mean January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Carrbutte soil.  Carrbutte soils are clayey-skeletal, deep to paralithic contacts, and have thick mollic epipedons and argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grohs soils are used for livestock grazing, wood production, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native vegetation is a forest canopy of western juniper and ponderosa pine with an understory of Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, and curlleaf mountainmahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral Oregon.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 21.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Klamath County (Gerber Block of Fremont National Forest Area), Oregon, 1998.  The name is from an old ranch in the area.
