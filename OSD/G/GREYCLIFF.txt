GREYCLIFF SERIES

The Greycliff series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Natrustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Greycliff silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine, common fine and few medium pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)  

    Bt--5 to 11 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) crushed, moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and common fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Btkn--11 to 15 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam; dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and common fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bkn--15 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine and medium pores; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 inches thick) 

    C1--31 to 37 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, slighty sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine and medium pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 14 inches thick)

    2C2--37 to 60 inches; variegated colors, very cobbly loamy sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 20 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana; 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1455. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 11 inches (A, Bt horizons); a natric horizon from 11 to 15 inches (Btkn horizon); a calcic horizon from 15 to 31 inches (Bkn horizon); a particle size control section from 5 to 40 inches (Bt, Btkn, Bkn, C, 2C horizons).  Greycliff soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
