Klawasi soils a very poorly drained, lack cryoturbation, have a histic epipedon, have a loess cap over clayey lacustrine sediments, and occur on lacustrine terraces.
Kluna soils are well drained, lack permafrost, have stratified horizons of sandy and silty alluvium, and occur on stream terraces and floodplains.
Tacaes soils are very poorly drained, lack permafrost, are organic soils, have permafrost, and occur in depressions and drainages.
