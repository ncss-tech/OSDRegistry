GAPMESA SERIES

The Gapmesa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone. Gapmesa soils are on cuestas, hills, ridges, and mesas. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Gapmesa very fine sandy loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate very coarse platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; common very fine vesicular pores; 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bt1--2 to 8 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) gravelly very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; many faint continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 18 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--8 to 21 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) gravelly very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; many faint continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 22 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary (0 to 16 inches thick) 

    Bk--21 to 28 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots in cracks; common irregular carbonate threads throughout; strongly effervescent; 33 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    R--28 inches; hard Dakota sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: Current competitors are the Balon, Blancot, Bowbac, Buckle, Cambria, Cerrillos, Cushman, Decolney, Doakum, Fort, Gapbutte, Hagerman, Los Alamos, Mentmore, Oelop, Olney, Palacid, Pawspoc, Penistaja, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Quagwa, Redpen, Spangler, Spenlo, Sundance, and Teckla series.  Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Gaddes and Yenlo series.  A potential competitor still classified in the Ustollic subgroup is the Harbord series.  Balon, Blancot, Buckle, Cambria, Decolney, Doakum, Fort, Harbord, Mentmore, Oelop, Olney, Palacid, Penistaja, Pokeman, Potts, Quagwa, Redpen, Sundance, Teckla, and Yenlo soils are very deep.  Bowbac and Spangler soils are moderately deep to argillaceous sandstone.  Cerrillos and Spenlo soils have calcic horizons and should be classified as Calciargids. Cushman and Pugsley soils are moderately deep to soft sandstone or shale.  Gapbutte and Pawspoc soils are moderately deep to basalt.  Gaddes soils are moderately deep to weathered granite.  Los Alamos soils are moderately deep to pumice and ash. In addition, the Bowbac, Cushman, Decolney, Fort, Hagerman, Harbord, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance and Tekla soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June.
