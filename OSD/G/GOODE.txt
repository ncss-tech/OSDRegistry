GOODE SERIES

The Goode series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium and glacial drift over glacial drift on valley walls, alluvial fans, fan terraces, and Pleistocene terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent on alluvial fans, fan terraces, and terraces and 25 to 60 percent on valley walls. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bertolotti, Cliffdell, Deroux, Littlejohn, Mesahchie (T), Mountaineer, Pheeney, Pitcher, Roxer, Scotties, and Umpa series. Bertolotti soils contain angular gneiss and granitic rock fragments and lack material of glacial origin. Cliffdell soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section. Deroux, Littlejohn, Mountaineer, Pheeney, and Umpa soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Mesahchie soils have an umbric epipedon.  Pitcher soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section, contain angular rock fragments of extrusive igneous origin, and lack material of glacial origin. Roxer soils have 7 to 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and contain basalt rock fragments. Scotties soils are deep to a lithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goode soils are on valley walls, alluvial fans, fan terraces and Pleistocene terraces at elevations of 350 to 1,200 meters. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash, colluvium, and glacial drift over glacial drift. The climate consists of warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 600 to 1,600 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 70 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Farway, Inspiration (T), Lyall (T), and Mesahchie (T) soils. Farway soils are found on more stable portions of all the same landforms, have andic soil properties in horizons greater than 35 cm thick, and are ashy over loamy-skeletal. Inspiration soils are found on stable portions of the same valley walls,  have andic soil properties in horizons greater than 35 cm thick, and are ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal.  Lyall soils are found on active or young portions of alluvial fans and valley walls and lack andic soil properties. Mesahchie soils have an umbric epipedon and are located on similar landforms under more herbaceous vegetation or a more open coniferous canopy.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for watershed, recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, bigleaf maple, and vine maple with an understory of serviceberry, snowbrush ceanothus, pinegrass, aster, pachistima, birchleaf spirea, and kinnikinnick. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Cascade Mountains, Washington. MLRA 3. Series is of moderate extent.
