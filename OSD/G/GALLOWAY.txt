DISTRIBUTION: New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cumberland County, New Jersey, 1998

REMARKS: Galloway soils were previously mapped with the Klej series. Klej soils originally ranged from somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained. The Galloway soils are established to replace the moderately well drained component of Klej soils.  They are in a drainage catena of sandy soils with Klej soils (seasonal high water table at 1.0 to 2.0 feet); Galloway soils (2.0 to 4.0 feet); Runclint soils (4.0 to 6.0 feet); and Evesboro soils (greater than 6.0 feet).

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soils characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 9 inches (Ap horizon).
Aquic conditions--the zone from 28 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation).
