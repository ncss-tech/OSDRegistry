GOODHOPE SERIES

The Goodhope series consists of well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in firm glacial till.  The soils are on moraines and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, acid Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goodhope silt loam, forest.  (Colors are for moist soil).

     01--3 to 1 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) partially decomposed forest litter; many fine roots; abrupt, smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

     02--1 to 0 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sapric peat; many fine roots; abrupt, smooth boundary.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

     C1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; few, fine, prominent reddish brown mottles; weak, fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common, fine roots; strongly acid; clear, wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

     C2--3 to 10 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) silty clay loam; many large patches of dark grayish brown; weak, thin platy structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

     C3--10 to 44 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) gravelly silty clay loam; many large light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) and dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) patches; massive; firm, sticky, plastic; 15 percent gravel; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Anchorage Area, Alaska; about 1/2 mile west of Birchwood in SE 1/4 SE 1/4 of Section 13, T.15N, R.2W, Seward Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Stoniness class ranges from 0 to 1.  The texture of the upper 10 inches is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Matrix colors of moist soil in the upper 10 inches are in hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, with value of 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Below the 10 inch depth, matrix colors for moist soil are in hues ol 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  A few faint brown or gray mottles may occur in the upper 20 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kenai, Matanuska, and Purches series.  Kenai soils have brown or reddish brown spodic horizons and have formed in silty loess over firm glacial till.  Matanuska soils formed in silty clay loam lacustrine sediments over compact very gravelly drift.  Purches soils have mottled spodic horizons formed in very shallow silty loess over compact very gravelly till.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Goodhope soils occur on moraines and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  Elevations are between 50 and 1,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 14 to 20 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is about 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Purches soils and the Clam Gulch, Homestead, and Spenard soils.  The Clam Gulch soils are strongly mottled.  Homestead soils have a spodic horizon formed in shallow loess and have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Spenard soils have mottled spodic horizons formed in silt loam loess over firm glacial till.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to moderately well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly in forest dominated by white spruce and paper birch;  few areas of urban use.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cook Inlet-Susitna Lowland, Alaska; small extent.
