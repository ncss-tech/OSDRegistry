GANADO SERIES

The Ganado series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains on river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent but are dominantly less than 1. Mean annual precipitation is , mean annual air temperature is about. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Typic Hapluderts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ganado clay--on a nearly level flood plain in pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

Datum:WGS84

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture:  An udic soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section remains most in some or all parts for more than 270 days in normal years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 21.7 to 22.2 degrees C (71 to 72 degrees F)
Solum thickness is more than 152 cm (60 in).
The  25 to 100 (10- to 40- in) control section contains 35 to 60 percent clay.
In virgin areas, gilgai microrelief consists of microknolls 13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 in) higher than the microdepressions, with distance between center of microknoll and center of microdepression being 1.5 to 6.1 m (5 to 20 ft).  When dry, cracks 0.3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) wide extend from the surface to depth of 102 cm (40 in) or more but remain open less than 90 cumulative days each year in most years.  Intersecting slickensides begin at depths of 25 to 91 cm (10 to 36 in).  Most pedons are slightly to strongly effervescent at depths below 61 cm (24 in), and many are calcareous throughout.  
Concretions and masses of calcium carbonate range from few to common below a depth of 64 (25 in) in most pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Laewest and Lake Charles series in the same family. Similar soils are the Navaca, Pledger, Tinn,  and Trinity series.
Laewest soils: allow colors yellower than 10YR; formed in late Pleistocene age fluviomarine deposits; more acidic in the upper part 
Lake Charles soils: have colors redder than 10YR in the lower part; formed in late Pleistocene age fluviomarine deposits; are more acidic in the upper part
Navaca soils: do not have intersecting slickensides; have contrasting particle-size control section
Pledger- are in a very fine family; have colors redder than 10YR in the lower part
Tinn and Trinity soils: have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F): In addition, Tinn soils are clayey throughout; Trinity soils are in a very-fine family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: clayey alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock
Landscape: river valleys
Landform: flood plains
Slope: less than 1 percent, but range to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 1041 to 1219 mm (41 to 48 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 20.6 to 21.7 degrees C (69 to 71 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Navidad, Chicolete, and Zalco series.
Navidad, Chicolete, and Zalco soils: have less than 35 percent clay throughout the control section.  These soils occur on slightly higher convex shaped areas associated with natural levees of streams.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: Moderate well
Permeability class: very slow
Runoff: high slopes less than 1 percent and very high on slopes of 1 to 2 percent.  Water enters the soil rapidly when dry and cracked, and very slow when it is moist.  
Seasonal water table: a perched water table occurs in the A and Bss horizons for periods less than 2 weeks in duration in winter and spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: improved pasture and rangeland.
Native vegetation: pecan, elm, and live oak, with an understory of grasses such as big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, Texas wintergrass, and wild rye.
Ecological sites assigned to phases and components of this series are listed below. Current ecological site assignments are in Web Soil Survey. Components of this series include the following ecological sites:  Clayey Bottomland

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area: Middle Gulf Coastal Prairies of Texas
Land Resource Region: T (Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region)
Major Land Resource Area:  MLRA: 150A (Gulf Coast Prairies)
Extent: small
