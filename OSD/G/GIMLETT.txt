GIMLETT SERIES



The Gimlett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that

formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Gimlett soils are on stream

terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2  percent.  Permeability is moderate

in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  The average annual

precipitation is about 17 inches, and the average annual air

temperature is about 40 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Haploxerolls

Haploxerolls.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Gimlett very gravelly sandy loam on a 1 percent south

facing slope at an elevation of 5,880 feet in rangeland.  When

described on June 27, 1984, the soil was moist below 3 inches.  (Colors

are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

carbonate) on underneath sides of fragments - matrix is noneffervescent

and coatings are slightly effervescent.



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buckcreek, Doodlelink(T), Lamondi,

and Piersonte soils.  Buckcreek soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over

bedrock.  Doodlelink and Lamondi soils contain 20 to 30 percent clay

and lack sandy skeletal layers in the control section.  Piersonte soils

have 18 to 30 percent clay in the control section and have angular rock

fragments in the control section.  Piersonte soils lack sandy skeletal

layers above 40 inches.  Piersonte soils lack sandy-skeletal layers

above 40 inches.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gimlett soils occur on stream terraces and have

slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,000 feet.

The soil formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  The annual

precipitation ranges from 16 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow

and early spring rain.  The annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 42

degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 60 to 75 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adamson, Balaam, Drage,

and Isknat.  Adamson soils have coarse loamy over sandy or sandy

skeletal particle size control sections and occur on lower stream

terraces.  Balaam soils have sandy skeletal control sections and occur

on lower stream terraces.  Drage soils have argillic horizons and

accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate in the subsoil and occur

on fan terraces.  Isknat soils are clayey skeletal and occur on the

same landscape.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow runoff; moderate

permeability in the upper part and very rapid in the lower horizons.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for homesites.  Vegetation is mountain

big sagebrush and Idaho fescue.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gimlett soils are inextensive in south

central Idaho.
