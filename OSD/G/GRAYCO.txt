GRAYCO SERIES

The Grayco series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Grayco soils are on outwash plains and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Haplargids
