GUCKEEN SERIES

The Guckeen series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of clayey lacustrine sediments and in the underlying loamy, calcareous till. These soils are on plane to convex slopes on nearly level to gently undulating till plains or ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aquertic Hapludolls
