GYPIMACK SERIES

The Gypimack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Gypimack soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Calcic Argigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON: Gypimack clay loam, 1 percent slope in an apple orchard at an elevation of 1,433 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Ap--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

	Btk--13 to 25 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots inside and between peds; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and few faint clay films on surfaces along pores; few fine calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 50 cm thick)

	Btky1--25 to 51 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots inside and between peds; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common fine and medium calcium carbonate masses and few fine gypsum masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

	Btky2--51 to 81 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common fine and medium calcium carbonate masses and few fine gypsum masses in the matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Btky horizons is 0 to 69 cm)

	Bky1--81 to 99 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gypsiferous sandy clay loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few fine calcium carbonate masses and common fine and medium gypsum masses in the matrix; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (20 to 43 cm thick)

	Bky2--99 to 200 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few very fine and fine calcium carbonate masses and common fine gypsum masses in the matrix; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - treads and risers of stream terraces
Elevation - 1,372 to 1,768 meters
Slopes - 0 to 10 percent
Parent material - alluvium derived from sandstone and shale
Mean annual air temperature - 10 to 12.8 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation - 152 to 229 mm
Precipitation pattern - significant increases in spring, late summer and early fall

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gyprockmesa and Fruita series which occur on similar landforms. Gyprockmesa soils do not have a gypsic horizon above 100 cm and they have cobbles and stones in the lower part of the subsoil. Fruita soils do not have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow and moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Gypimack soils are used for irrigated cropland, fruit orchard production, and urban development. Native vegetation is Indian ricegrass, galleta, shadscale saltbush and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Gypimack soils are of small extent in western Colorado; MLRA 34B.
