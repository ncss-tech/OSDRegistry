GLENTIVAR SERIES

The Glentivar series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, and shale.  Glentivar soils are on hills or pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 127 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 15 to 30 cm.  (Bt horizon)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 30 cm.  (A, Bt horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 53 to 102 cm.  (Bk2, Bk3, Bk4 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 30 cm.  (Bt horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 102 cm.  (Cr layer)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
