GREENOUGH SERIES

The Greenough series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from tertiary sediment. These soils are on stream terraces and hills. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Udic Haplustalfs  

TYPICAL PEDON: Greenough silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    E--2 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak, very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine pores; 10 percent pebbles, moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 16 inches thick) 

    E/Bt--10 to 24 inches; E part (80 percent) is light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist which interfingers into the B part; B part (20 percent) is light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; texture mixed is silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (14 to 27 inches thick) 

    Bt1--24 to 51 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bt2--51 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - stream terraces; hills. 
Elevation - 3,200 to 4,500 feet. 
Slope - 4 to 35 percent. 
Parent material - alluvium and colluvium from tertiary sediments. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 16 to 22 inches. 
Mean annual temperature - 40 to 44 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 100 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Greenough soils are used for timber production, woodland grazing, homesite development, and recreation. The native vegetation is ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with an understory of pinegrass, common snowberry, and dwarf huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Greenough soils are of moderate extent in western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: St. Regis-Ninemile Area, Montana, 1970. 

REMARKS: Soil interpretation record: MT0151. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 24 inches (E, E/Bt horizons); an albic horizon from 2 to 10 inches (E horizon); a glossic horizon from 10 to 24 inches (E/Bt horizon); an argillic horizon from 24 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 24 to 44 inches (Bt1 horizon). Greenough soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
