REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously published as water in Connecticut  Soil Survey publications.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include--
Peraquic feature--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 1.5 meters of salt or brackish water).
Particle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches) is fine-silty.
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 12 centimeters (Aseg horizon).
Hypersulfidic materials--The zone from 12 to 247 centimeters (Cseg1, Cseg2, and Cseg3 horizons) have oxidized reactions with pH values less than 4 after 16 weeks.
N-value > 0.7--The zone from 0 to 200 centimeters (Aseg and Cseg horizons)
