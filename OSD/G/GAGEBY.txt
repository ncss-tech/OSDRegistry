GAGEBY SERIES

The Gageby series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvium. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on floodplains or draws on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Gageby clay loam--on a less than 1 percent slope in a cultivated field.

Combined thickness of the B horizons is 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in)

  BCk--150 to 203 cm (59 to 80 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few films and threads of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy alluvium
Landscape: dissected plain

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Spur series and the Colorado, Guadalupe, Lincoln, Sweetwater, Yahola, and Yomont series. 
Colorado, Guadalupe, Lincoln, Yahola, and Yomont soils: do not have a mollic epipedon; In addition, Guadalupe and Yahola soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section; Lincoln soils have a sandy particle-size control section; and Yomont soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section
Sweetwater soils: have dark gray A horizons, are poorly drained, and are sandy in the lower part of the control section

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes. The soils overflow for very brief periods about 1 or 2 times a year to once in 10 years.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for both cultivated crops and rangeland. Principal crops are wheat, sorghums, and cotton; in subirrigated areas, alfalfa. Native grasses are blue grama, buffalograss, sideoats grama, western wheatgrass, and switchgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Texas and southwestern Oklahoma. In the Central Rolling Red Plains and Rolling Limestone Prairie (LRR H; MLRA 78). The series is extensive.
