GOTHIC SERIES

The Gothic series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on mountain slopes, fan remnants, dip slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 585 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Gothic loam, on a northeast-facing, concave, 38 percent mountain slope at an elevation of 2,853 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on September 8, 1987, the soil was moist throughout.)

    A1--0 to 20 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.

    A2--20 to 38 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons is 15 to 38 cm)

    Bt1--38 to 46 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many faint and distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 22 cm thick)

    Bt2--46 to 89 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt3--89 to 127 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt2 and Bt3 horizons is 50 to 102 cm)

    Bt4--127 to 168 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).
