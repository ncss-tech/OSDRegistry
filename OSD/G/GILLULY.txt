GILLULY SERIES

The Gilluly series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, eolian and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks.  Gilluly soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 74 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Utah County, Utah, Duchesne Area, Utah, Parts of Duchesne, Utah and Wasatch Counties soil survey area, 2011.  Named for Gilluly Loop, a serpentine RR track near the type location, where you can view a train moving away and moving toward you at the same time.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 83 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 13 to 62 cm.  (Bt and Btk  horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 31 cm.  (A and Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 62 cm.  (Bt and Btk horizons)
Secondary carbonate accumulations:  in the zone from 46 to 73 cm (Btk and Bk horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with interbedded limestone, sandstone and shale at 73 cm.  (R horizon)

The Btk and Bk horizon do not qualify as a calcic horizon due either to insufficient thickness or carbonate equivalent.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
