GRINDALL SERIES

The Grindall series consists of moderately deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in partially decomposed organic material that overlies bedrock of various origins.  Grindall soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of hills and valleysides.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 130 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Dysic Lithic Cryohemists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Grindall peat - on a NW facing ridge of 9 percent slope under muskeg and alpine vegetation at 1400 feet.  (All colors are for moist soils)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; very dusky red (2.5YR 2.5/2) broken face, reddish brown (5 YR 4/3) pressed and rubbed peat (90% fibers undisturbed and rubbed); many fine and very fine roots; extremely acid (pH 3.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Oe1--1 to 4 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) broken face, pressed, and rubbed mucky peat (60% fibers undisturbed, 50% fibers rubbed, and 50% fibers washed); many fine and very fine roots; extremely acid (pH 3.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Oe2--4 to 18 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) broken face, pressed, and rubbed mucky peat (60% fibers undisturbed, 50% fibers rubbed and 60% fibers washed); many fine and very fine roots; extremely acid (pH 3.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

    Oe3--18 to 32 inches; black (5YR 2.5/1) broken face, pressed, and rubbed mucky peat (30% fibers undisturbed, 20% rubbed, and 30% washed); many fine and very fine roots; extremely acid (pH 3.9); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

    Oe4--32 to 36 inches; black (5YR 2.5/1) broken face, pressed, and rubbed extremely gravelly mucky peat (30% fibers undisturbed and 20% rubbed; many fine and very fine roots; 70 percent gravel; extremely acid (pH 3.9); abrupt irregular boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

    R--36 inches; schist bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Ketchikan Area, Alaska.  In the NW1/4, SE1/4, Section 11, T.76S., R.85E., Copper River Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 21 to 36 inches.   Thickness of the organic layers ranges from 16 to 36 inches. The subsurface tier is dominated by hemic material.  Mean annnual soil temperature is below 46 degrees F.  The soil does not freeze below 2 inches in most years due to maritime influence.  pH ranges from 3.2 to 4.0 (0.01M CaCl2).

The value moist of the Oe layers is 2.5 or 3, the chroma moist ranges from 1 to 3.

A C horizon may be present in some pedons.  Hue ranges from 5YR to 10YR; value moist is 4 or 5, and chroma moist is 1 or 2.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hydaburg series which is shallower than 20 inches to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grindall soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of hills and valley sides and is typically associated with structural benches on these landforms.  The climate is humid maritime with an average annual precipitation of about 130 inches.  Snow remains on the ground about 9 months of the year.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is below 46 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Hydaburg series, and the Kina, St. Nicholas, and Wadleigh soils.  Kina soils are very deep organic soils in depressional areas.  St. Nicholas soils are mineral soils on shoulderslopes of mountains.  Wadleigh soils are mineral soils on footslopes of valleysides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly and very poorly drained; Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slow to rapid runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Open muskeg vegetation; Used for wildlife habitat and watershed protection.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Alaska.  The series is of moderate extent.
