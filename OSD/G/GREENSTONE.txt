GREENSTONE SERIES

The Greenstone series consists of shallow, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till overlying sedimentary bedrock on ground moraines and post glacial lake shores.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, isotic, frigid, shallow Fragiaquic Hapludalfs

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no soils in the same taxonomic family.  Taxonomically related soils are the Ensign, Freda, and Zeba series.
Ensign - are underlain by limestone and are in the Lithic Eutrudepts Subgroup
Freda - are in the Lithic Haplorthods Subgroup
Zeba - are underlain by acidic sandstone and are in the Argic Endoaquods Subgroup

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material  loamy till
Landforms  nearly level to depressional ground moraines overlying siltstone and sandstone on 1)bedrock structural benches and 2)post glacial lake shores.
Slope - 0 to 3 percent
Elevation - 180 to 305 meters
Mean annual precipitation - 760 to 860 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Big Iron, Flintsteel, and Nonesuch soils.
Big Iron - are on adjacent landscape positions, deeper than 152 centimeters to bedrock, and in the Aquic Glossudalfs Subgroup
Flintsteel - are on adjacent landscape positions, deeper than 152 centimeters to bedrock, and in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs Subgroup
Nonesuch - are on slightly higher landscape positions and in the Oxyaquic Fragiorthods Subgroup

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage - a seasonal zone of water saturation exists from a depth of 15 to 61 centimeters, perched above the siltstone bedrock, from October to June
(somewhat poorly drained). Internal drainage is impeded by the bedrock.
Surface runoff - low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum.  
 
USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested.  Principal species are quaking aspen, red maple, sugar maple, green ash, yellow birch, hemlock, white pine, and white spruce.  A few areas are used for pasture.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Major Land Resource Area 92  Superior Lake Plain; Ontonagon  County Michigan Subset, January 2007. Proposed in Ontonagon County, Michigan, 2001.  The name is derived from a waterfall in Ontonagon County.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in the typical pedon include: 
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 15 centimeters (Oa and Bw horizons)
Argillic horizon - 15 to 46 centimeters (Bt and Btx horizons)
Paralithic materials - 46 to 53 centimeters (2Crt horizon)
Lithic contact - 53 centimeters (2R horizon)
Aquic feature - iron accumulations at 5 centimeters and iron depletions at 15 centimeters
Fragipan feature - 30 to 46 centimeters (Btx horizon)
Shallow depth class - root limiting paralithic contact at 46 centimeters (2Crt horizon)
Greenstone is not in the Lithic Subgroup because the bedrock is deeper than 50 centimeters.
