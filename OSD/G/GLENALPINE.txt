GLENALPINE SERIES

The Glenalpine series consists of deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic and metamorphic rock. The Glenalpine soils are on mountainsides and glacial valley walls. Slopes range from 50 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Humic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Glenalpine on a south facing (173 degree), 70 percent slope at an elevation of 7457 meters. When described on 06/24/2002 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

(25 to 50 cm thick)

	Bw1--29 to 65 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) extremely cobbly fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine through coarse roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; neutral, pH 7.0 by Bromthymol blue; clear wavy boundary.

	Bw2--65 to 102 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) extremely cobbly fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common medium and few very fine roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel; neutral, pH 6.8 by Bromthymol blue;  gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

	C--102 to 128 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) extremely cobbly fine sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots throughout; 50 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel; neutral, pH 7.0 by Bromthymol blue; (13 to 38 cm thick)

	Cd--128 to 150 cm; dense glacial till

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glenalpine soils are on mountainsides. Slopes are 50 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium weathered from volcanic and metamorphic rock. Elevation is 1895 to 2790 meters. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 840 to 1550 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7.9 degrees C. Frost free season is 40 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rockbound and Callat soils. The Rockbound soils are shallow to hard granitic bedrock and in the glacial valley below.  Callat soils are colder, on the ridge above Glenalpine and are 50 to 100 centimeters deep to dense till.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: excessively drained; low runoff; very rapid permeability above the dense till. The soils are not flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife. Vegetation is shrubs with scattered conifers.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Glenalpine is of minor extent in California in MLRA:   22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: El Dorado County, (Tahoe Basin area), California. Source of name is from the name of a local soda spring which at one time was a popular leisure resort.  The springs were thought to have curing properties.
