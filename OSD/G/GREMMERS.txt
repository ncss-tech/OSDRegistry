GREMMERS SERIES

The Gremmers series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  Gremmers soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, active, mesic, shallow Xereptic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gremmers very gravelly coarse sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 45 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gremmers soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  Slopes are 4 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Zafod and Bienfait soils.  Zafod soils are loamy-skeletal and moderately deep to duripans.  Bienfait soils are sandy, very deep, and have cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability in horizons above the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gremmers soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28A.
