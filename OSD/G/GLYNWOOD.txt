GLYNWOOD SERIES

The Glynwood series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. They formed in a thin layer of loess and the underlying till. These soils are on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cardington, Ellsworth, Geeburg, Mortimer, Pert, Shinrock, and Wyatt series. Cardington, Ellsworth, and Geeburg soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 22 percent in the lower part of the series control section. Mortimer soils average more than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Pert soils have sola less than 63 cm (25 inches) thick. Shinrock and Wyatt soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glynwood soils are on ground moraines and end moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradient is typically 2 to 18 percent, but ranges from 0 to 40 percent. They formed in a thin layer of loess and the underlying clay loam or silty clay loam till. Some areas do not have a loess mantle. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 170 days. Elevation is 244 to 305 meters (800 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Blount, well drained Lybrand, moderately well drained Morley, and very poorly drained Pewamo soils that are in a toposequence with the Glynwood soils. Blount soils are on flatter or more concave positions. Lybrand and Morley soils are on higher positions or more sloping areas along drainageways. Pewamo soils are in depressions and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the solum and low in the dense till. Permeability is slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the dense till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, grass-legume hay, oats, soybeans, and wheat. A relatively small proportion is in permanent bluegrass pasture or in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, principally ash, beech, elm, hickory, oak, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Ohio, southern Michigan, and northern Indiana; mainly in MLRA 111B and less extensively in MLRAs 97, 98, 99, 111A, and 111C. The series is of large extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Miami County, Ohio, 1973.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap, E, BE horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 58 cm (2Bt horizon).
Densic contact: at 81 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons between a depth of 30 and 81 cm (2Bt, 2BC horizons).

A limestone substratum phase is recognized. The thin solum phase mapped in earlier surveys does not fit the series concept. It likely will be recorrelated as a new series when its area of use is updated.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence of densic materials in the 2Cd horizon.

Glynwood map units in lake plain settings will need to be evaluated during MLRA modernization projects.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory are available for the following pedons: AG-1 (type location), AG-8, MC-11, LG-40, MW-16, and SA-30. Laboratory characterization data is also available from the USDA, NRCS, National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.
