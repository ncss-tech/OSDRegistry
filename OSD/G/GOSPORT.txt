GOSPORT SERIES

The Gosport series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 0 to 40 centimeters of silty or loamy materials of unknown origin and in the underlying residuum from brown and gray acid Pennsylvania shales with clayey shale at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters. These soils are on convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams. Slope ranges from 5 to 50 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Indian Creek Project, Iowa, 1938.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 centimeters (A and E horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 18 centimeters (E horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 18 to 69 centimeters (2Bw1, 2Bw2, and 2Bt horizons);
paralithic contact--the contact with clayey shale at a depth of 69 centimeters (2Cr horizon);
udic moisture regime.

The geological origin of the mantle is uncertain; it may be loess, till, loess-till mixture, or residuum from interbedded shale and sandstone.

Drainage class is difficult to assess because of the color inherited from the shale.

The gray colors in the lower half of the series control section are inherited from the shale and were not considered in classification of the series.  The extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  However, available data indicate that the clay mineralogy typically is illitic and the particle-size class is fine family.
