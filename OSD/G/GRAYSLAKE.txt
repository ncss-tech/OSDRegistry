GRAYSLAKE SERIES

The Grayslake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in organic material of water-tolerant plants. Grayslake soils are in bogs of mountain basins.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic Typic Cryohemists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Grayslake peat - on a 0 percent slope. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 17 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) peat; rubbed and pressed fibric material; about 100 percent unrubbed fibers, 85 percent rubbed; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Oe1--17 to 52 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky peat; rubbed and pressed hemic material; about 85 percent unrubbed fibers; 25 percent rubbed; many very fine, fine, and common medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary.  

    Oe2--52 to 81 cm; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat; rubbed and pressed hemic material; about 60 percent unrubbed fibers, 20 percent rubbed; many very fine and common fine roots; very slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    Oe3--81 to 140 cm; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat; rubbed and pressed hemic material; about 50 percent unrubbed fibers, 10 percent rubbed; many very fine and common fine roots; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Oe horizons is 85 to 125 cm thick)

    Oa--140 to 165 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) muck; rubbed and pressed sapric material; about 25 percent unrubbed fibers, 0 percent rubbed; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).

TYPE LOCATION:  Bonneville County, Idaho; about 6.5 kilometers northwest of the Grays Lake Guard Station and 350 meters south of the west end of Bear Island.
