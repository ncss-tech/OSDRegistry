GRAYFORD SERIES

The Grayford series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in less than 56 cm (22 inches) of loess and in the underlying till of Illinoian age and residuum from limestone. They are on dissected till plains and sinkholes. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Ultic Hapludalfs

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grayford soils are typically on shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains and sinkholes. Slope gradient is dominantly 6 to 25 percent, and ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Grayford soils formed in less than 56 cm (22 inches) of loess and in the underlying till of Illinoian age and residuum from limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 122 to 259 meters (400 to 850 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blocher, Caneyville, Cincinnati, Hickory, Ryker, and Stinesville soils. The moderately deep, more clayey Caneyville soils are on lower lying backslopes of hills. The moderately well drained, very deep Blocher and Cincinnati soils are commonly on higher lying summits, shoulders and backslopes and the very deep Hickory soils are on backslopes of dissected till plains. The very deep Ryker and Stinesville soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains and sinkholes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for hay, pasture, and or are in forest. A few areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, and wheat. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 114A, 114B, 121, and 122 in southern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and north central Kentucky. The series is of moderate extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jennings County, Indiana, 1938. 

REMARKS: The classification of this series is borderline between fine-loamy and fine-silty. The typical pedon averages about 14.6 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section. Also data from Owen County, IN (S92IN119-26) places this series in the Typic rather than Ultic subgroup of Hapludalfs. Therefore the classification of this series could change as more data is collected. 

Representative component and horizon data is in DMU# 153531 and 153538. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 15 cm (6 inches) (Ap horizon). 
Argillic horizon: from 15 to 132 cm (6 to 52 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 3Bt5 horizons). 
Lithic contact: at 132 cm (52 inches) (top of the 3R layer).
