Camptown soils: have aquic conditions; in relict meanderbelt channels 
Evadale and Kinder soils: have aquic conditions; on flats  
Glenmora soils: have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; on broad stream divides
Texla soils: have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; on oval to oblong pimple mounds
Vidor soils: have exchangeable sodium percentages greater than 15; on flats

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  moderately well drained. Runoff is low. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very slow in the lower argillic horizon. These soils are saturated within the glossic horizon for more than 30 days during winter and early spring months. Endosaturation occurs in the lower part of the argillic horizon during the winter and early spring months. Redoximorphic features are formed during abnormally wet periods.  
 
USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for woodland and native pasture.  Most areas are in pine and hardwood, mainly loblolly pine, water oak, and sweetgum.  The understory vegetation is mainly yaupon and American beautyberry with andropogon, paspalum, and panicum species.  A few areas have been cleared and used for improved pastures of bahiagrass and bermudagrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas and southwestern Louisiana; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 152B (Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods). The series is of moderate extent.
