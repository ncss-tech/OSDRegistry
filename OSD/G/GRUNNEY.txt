GRUNNEY SERIES

The Grunney series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Grunney soils are on floodplains and valley bottoms and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Grunney soils in an area of Grunney mucky loam on slope of 2 percent at 2280 meters elevation in a meadow.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

  A1--12 to 32 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) gravelly mucky loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4), moist, and yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist, iron-manganese masses; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

  A2--32 to 39 centimeters; very dark gray (N 3/0) crushed, mucky silt loam; black (N 2.5/0), moist; weak medium granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4), moist, and yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist, iron-manganese masses; 10 percent gravel ; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (A horizon thickness: 25-50 centimeters)

  Cg--39 to 150 centimeters; 90 percent light gray (10YR 7/2) and 10 percent very dark gray (N 3/0) stratified loamy sand to sandy loam to silt loam, 60 percent gray (10YR 5/1), moist, and 30 percent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), moist, and 10 percent black (N 2.5/0), moist; massive; very friable; nonsticky, nonplastic; 10 percent medium prominent irregular reddish brown (5YR 4/4), moist, and yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist, iron-manganese concretions; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
