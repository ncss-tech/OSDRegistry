GULCH SERIES

The Gulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium from mixed sources.   Gulch soils are on stream terraces, fan terraces, and relict basin floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amorose (NM), Grizzle (AZ), Headquarters (NM), McAllister (AZ), McNeal (AZ), Redona (NM) and Tinney (NM) series.  Amorose and Redona soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.

Amorose, Redona, Tinney, and McAllister soils have calcic horizons below 20 inches.

Grizzle soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gulch soils are on stream terraces, fan terraces, and relict basin floors at elevations of 3,800 to 4,600 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous alluvium from mixed sources.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Graveyard, Major, Sasabe, Diaspar, Caralampi and Tombstone soils.  Graveyard and Sasabe soils are fine textured.  Major soils have a gypsic horizon.  Diaspar soils are coarse-loamy.  Caralampi and Tombstone soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for military training and as an artillery impact area.  Vegetation includes creosotebush, javelina bush, whitethorn, desert zinnia, bush muhly, black grama and slim tridens.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Gulch soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA is 41.  Name derived from Graveyard Gulch Wash.
