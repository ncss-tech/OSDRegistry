MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES PROPOSED: Orange County, Virginia, 2001.

REMARKS: Grassland soils were previously mapped as Lignum soils. The change from thermic to mesic temperature regime resulted in the Lignum series being moved to due to larger extent in the thermic region. The typical pedon site for Grassland remains as the original site for the Lignum series in Orange County, Virginia.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap and BE horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 28 inches (Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 61 inches
