GARBO SERIES

The Garbo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous rock.  Garbo soils are on alluvial fans, relict stream terraces, beach plains, inset fans, and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Calciargids

(13 to 23 cm thick)

    2C--99 to 152 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 45 percent fine gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Garbo soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, relict stream terraces, beach plains, and inset fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from mixed igneous rock.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1524 to 1768 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Biblesprings, Deerlodge, Denmark, and Sevy soils.  Biblesprings soils have calcic horizons.  Deerlodge soils are moderately deep to duripans.  Denmark soils are shallow to petrocalcic horizons.  Sevy soils have nongravelly argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate or moderately slow permeability (moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity) in the upper part and moderately rapid or rapid permeability below (high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Garbo soils are used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The principal vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Utah.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28A.
