GUNSONE SERIES

The Gunsone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils occur on hills.  Slopes are 3 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 340 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Gunsone loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(8 to 15 cm thick)

(10 to 35 cm thick)

    C--115 to 200 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 10 percent fine reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) mottles and 5 percent fine reddish brown (2.5YR 5/3) mottles in the matrix; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
