TYPICAL PEDON: Greendale silt loam, 0 to 6 percent slopes, occasionally flooded. (Colors are for moist soil)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 10 percent by volume fragments of chert up to 51 mm (2 inches) in size; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (18 to 30 cm thick) 

 Bw1--23 to 56 cm (9 to 22 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; 15 percent by volume fragments of chert up to 51 mm (2 inches) in size; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick) 

 Bw2--56 to 71 cm (22 to 28) inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; 5 percent by volume fragments of chert up to 75 mm (3 inches) in size; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (13 to 30 cm thick) 

 Ab--71 to 86 cm (28 to 34 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; few fine roots; about 10 percent by volume fragments of chert up to 51 mm (2 inches) in size; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick) 

 Bwb--86 to152 cm (34 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly silt loam; few medium distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), and dark brown (10YR 3/3) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; 15 percent by volume fragments of chert up to 75 mm (3 inches) in size; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:
County: Hancock
State:  Tennessee
USGS Quadrangle: Sneedville, TN
Latitude (Decimal Degrees, NAD83): 36.5097222
Longitude (Decimal Degrees, NAD83): -83.1544444
Directions to the pedon: Follow Highway 66 about 2.5 mile south from where it turns south from the Clinch River, turn left on gravel road at Stony Gap Baptist church, then right on the next gravel road. Following the gravel roads about 1 km (0.5 mile) from the church, the site is about 13 meters (40 feet) north of the second gravel road.

Solum Thickness: 63 to 152 cm (25 to 60 inches)
Depth to bedrock: 152 cm or more (60 inches or more)
Depth Class: very deep
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 152 to 183 cm (5.0 to 6.0 feet)
Rock Fragment Content: rounded or subangular chert gravels range from 5 to 30 percent in each horizon
Soil Reaction: moderately acid or strongly acid, unless limed
Other: Redoximorphic features, typically gray iron depletions occur in some pedons at depths below 100 cm (40 inches)

Range of Individual Horizons:
A or Ap horizon:
Color: hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3
Texture (fine earth fraction): silt loam, loam, or rarely sandy loam. A few areas have a layer of recent overwash that is yellowish red or strong brown silty clay loam.

Bw horizon:
Color: hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, hue of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6
Texture (fine earth fraction): silt loam, loam, or rarely silty clay loam or clay loam
The particle size control section typically ranges from 18 to 32 percent clay, with fine sand and coarser ranging from about 10 to 45 percent.

Ab horizon (when present):
Color: hue of 10YR, value of 3, chroma of 2 or 3
Texture (fine earth fraction): silt loam or loam

Bwb horizon (when present):
Color: hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6
Texture (fine earth fraction): silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam
Other: clay films are sometimes present in this horizon. Redoximorphic depletions in shades of gray occur in places.
