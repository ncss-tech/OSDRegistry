GOSLIN SERIES

The Goslin series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in coarse textured alluvium derived from red sandstone.  The Goslin soils are on fan aprons, fan pediments, and alluvial terraces.  Slopes are 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goslin fine sandy loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; slightly effervescent, lime disseminated and as few soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

      C1--2 to 20 inches; Brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; very weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated and as common soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

      C2--20 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots upper 5 inches; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated and as common soft masses; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Sweetwater County, Wyoming; along Daniels Creek in the NE1/4, NW1/4 of sec. 8, T. 12 N., R. 105 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is sandy loam or fine sandy loam modified with 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Clay ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline throughout.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  A surface covering of gravel lag is common in some pedons.

The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Carbonates range from 5 to 20 percent with less than one-fourth as pedogenetic accumulation.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Carmody, Grieves, Riedel, Sham, and Tebbs series.  The Carmody and Riedel soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Grieves and Sham soils have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y throughout.  Sham soils also have loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam profiles.  Tebbs soils have 10YR hue in all C horizons and are more moist in July, August, and September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goslin soils are on fan aprons, fan pediments, and alluvial terraces.  They formed in coarse textured alluvium derived from red sandstone.  Slopes are 3 to 25 percent.  Elevations range from 6,300 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Almy and the competing Grieves soils.  Almy soils have developed Bt horizons and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid permeability depending upon slope; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is needleandthread, big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, thickspike wheatgrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Wyoming and northwestern Colorado.  The soils are of limited extent.

REMARKS:
The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.
