GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are Anguilla, Billington, Fort Neck, Noank, Niantic, Pishagqua, and Quaimbog soils.
Anguilla soils--formed in sandy estuarine deposits overlying sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits, are found on mainland coves and submerged mainland beaches in coastal estuaries and lagoons and have lithologic discontinuities
Billington soils--formed in coarse-silty estuarine deposits overlying highly-decomposed herbaceous organic materials and found on mainland coves in estuaries and bays
Fort Neck soils--formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and found on mainland coves and lagoon bottoms in coastal lagoons and bays and may include a lithological discontinuity with glaciofluvial deposits or glacial till
Noank soils--formed in thick sandy estuarine deposits and are found on coves in estuaries and sounds
Niantic soils--formed in thick sandy marine deposits and are found in open water habitats on bay bottoms and submerged mainland beaches in bays and sounds.
Pishagqua soils--have finer textured materials, are often very fluid, and formed in fine-silty estuarine deposits and are found on lagoon bottoms, mainland coves, and bay bottoms in coastal lagoons, sounds, and estuaries.
Quaimbog soils--formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits overlying highly-decomposed herbaceous organic materials and glaciolacustrine deposits or glaciofluvial deposits
