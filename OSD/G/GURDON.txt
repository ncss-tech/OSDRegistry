GURDON SERIES

The Gurdon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium high in silt. These soils are on Pleistocene terraces in the Western Coastal Plain, MLRA 133B. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Aquic Paleudults

COMPETING SERIES: Gurdon is the only series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gurdon soils are on level to nearly level stream terraces in the Western Coastal Plains. The soil formed in alluvium high in silt. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 52 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amy, Guyton, Smithton, Stough and Una series.
Amy soils occur on similar landscapes at slightly lower positions; have a fine-silty control section, and are poorly drained.
Guyton soils are on flood plains; have a fine-silty control section, higher base saturation and are poorly drained.
Smithton soils occur on similar landscapes; have a coarse-loamy control section, and are poorly drained.
Stough soils are on similar landscapes at slightly higher positions; have a coarse-loamy control section, and slightly more brittleness in the Bt horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Gurdon soils are somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow to medium and permeability is moderate. A perched water table is within 12 to 24 inches of the soil surface from November to April, most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are used for woodland and pasture with limited use for cultivated crops. Native trees are loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, sweetgum, willow oak, and shumard oak. Soybeans are the main cultivated crop. Common pasture grasses are tall fescue and bermudagrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Coastal Plains in Arkansas, Louisiana and possibly Oklahoma and Texas. This series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: TEMPLE, TEXAS

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Felker series.

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon-the zone for the surface to a depth of 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (A and BA horizons)

Argillic horizon- zone form 25 to 183 cm (10 to 72 in). (Bt horizon)

Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 76 cm (30 in) of the soil surface.
