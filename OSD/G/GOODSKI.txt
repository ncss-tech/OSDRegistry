GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goodski soils are on mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granite. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 2,165 to 3,200 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid, with cold, moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm. Mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days.

Brokit soils have 12 to 20 percent clay in the upper part and 3 to 10 percent in the strongly contrasting lower part of the particle-size control section, and they have ground water with an upper boundary at 76 to 100 cm at certain times during normal years.
Kious soils are shallow to a paralithic contact.
Lehman soils are poorly drained and are saturated within 25 cm of the surface during certain times of the year.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Goodski soils are used for recreation, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass and mountain big sagebrush. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY065NV, Shallow Loam 14+ P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
