GOWDY SERIES

The Gowdy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying silty clay loam glaciolacustrine deposits and till on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, active, mesic Arenic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Gowdy loamy fine sand, on a 4 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; about 3 percent fine gravel; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 E1--23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; single grain; loose; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 E2--41 to 71 cm (16 to 28 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; single grain; loose; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the E horizon ranges from 15 to 61 cm (6 to 24 inches).]

 2B/E--71 to 81 cm (28 to 32 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam (Bt); occupies 60 percent of the horizon surrounded or penetrated by tongues of pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam (E); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; about 3 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 inches) thick]

 2Bt--81 to 107 cm (32 to 42 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 5 percent fine gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick]

 2C--107 to 152 cm (42 to 60 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) silty clay loam; massive; firm; about 5 percent fine gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Gowdy soils are on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. Gowdy soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits 51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 inches) thick and in the underlying silty clay loam glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arkona, Ithaca, Perrinton, and Spinks soils. Arkona and Ithaca soils are somewhat poorly drained and in slightly lower positions on the landscape. The moderately well drained Perrinton soils are clayey throughout and are on similar landscape positions. The well drained Spinks soils are sandy throughout and contain lamellae of sandy loam or loamy sand within the profile.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy part and moderately low in the silty clay loam part. Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper part of the soil and slow in the lower part and in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the soil are cropped. The principal crop is corn. Some areas are woodlots or in pasture. Native vegetation is mixed forest cover of pine and deciduous trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 98 in west-central lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
