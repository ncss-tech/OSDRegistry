GUIDA SERIES

The Guida series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Guida loamy fine sand, on convex slope of 2        percent under a hardwood stand at an elevation of about 367 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  A-- 0 to 16 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 centimeters thick). 

  Bw1-- 16 to 37 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  

  Bw2-- 37 to 75 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4); loamy fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

  Bw3-- 75 to 104 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4); loamy fine sand; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 60 to 120 centimeters). 

  E and Bt-- 104 to 144 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3); loamy fine sand (E); weak coarse subangular blocky; very friable; lamellae of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam (Bt); weak medium platy structure; friable; lamellae are 2 to 10 millimeters in thickness with a total accumulation of 8 centimeters; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

C--144 to 203 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3); fine sand;single grain; loose; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) Fe concentrations and many coarse prominent light gray (10YR 7/1) Fe depletions; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION: MLRA 91A Central Minnesota Sandy Outwash; Crow Wing County, Minnesota; about 2 miles north and 1 mile west of Baxter; 1200 feet north and 500 feet east of the southwest corner of Section 25, T. 134 N., R. 29 W., USGS Gull lake, Minnesota Quadrangle; latitude 46 degrees 23 minutes 13 seconds N., longitude 94 degrees 17 minutes 03 seconds W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to carbonates--greater than 200 centimeters
Sand content of the particle-size control section averages--50-80 percent fine sand
Rock fragment content--0 to 2 percent, mixed lithology
Thickness of lamellae--2 to13 centimeters, combined 

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR

COMPETING SERIES: Westoo series.  Westoo soils do not have lamellae in the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform: Glacial lake plain 
Slope: 0 to 6 percent
Elevation: 360 to 375 meters above sea level 
Mean annual air temperature: 3 to 5 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation: 660 to 711 millimeters 
Frost-free period: 110 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barber, Lougee, Rifle and Zimmerman soils. The somewhat excessively drained Zimmerman soils are on summits. The somewhat poorly drained Barber soils are on footslopes and toeslopes. The very poorly drained Lougee and Rifle soils occur on broad flats and in depressions.  The Lougee soils formed in organic material over glaciolacustrine deposits.  The Rifle soils formed in organic material. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:             
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at 75 to 203 centimeters during April through May in normal years, and this saturation is considered apparent.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second in the upper part (A and Bw horizons) 14.14 to 42.34 micrometers per second in the lower part (E and Bt horizons).

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested.  Vegetation consists of oaks, birch, aspen, spruce, red pine; some areas are hayland.

Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic sections--Western lake section
