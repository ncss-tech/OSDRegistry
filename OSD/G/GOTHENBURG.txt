GOTHENBURG SERIES

The Gothenburg series consists of soils that are very shallow over gravelly coarse sand. They are poorly drained soils. These soils formed in alluvium on river valley flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 58 centimeters (23 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Psammaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Gothenburg loamy sand with a slope of 0 to 2 percent. When described, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine and medium roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (3 to 15 centimeters (1 to 6 inches) thick)

  C--8 to 20 centimeters (3 to 8 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose; 3 percent gravel by volume; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 36 centimeters (0 to 14 inches) thick)

  2Cg--20 to 203 centimeters (8 to 80 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; common, medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist iron masses in the soil matrix; single grain; loose; 30 percent gravel by volume; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arloval, Carrolls, Conrad, Dair, Forbar, Junius, Norway, Stafford, Thonet, Tryon, Tyre, and Wanser.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dawson County, Nebraska, 1975.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon-0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches)
Aquic conditions-0 to 200 centimeters (0 to 80 inches)

Before extensive flooding of the Platte River was controlled by 
upstream dams, this soil was unstable riverwash. Since 1940, these areas have become stabilized and vegetated with trees and grasses. In older surveys, these soils were called Loamy alluvial land, Gravelly alluvial land, or Mixed alluvial land. The depth to the water table within these soils is related to the water level in the channel. Periods of drought lower the water table within these soils.
