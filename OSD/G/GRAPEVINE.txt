GRAPEVINE SERIES

The Grapevine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with some gypsum.  Grapevine soils are on fan piedmonts and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 millimeters (5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C. (65 degrees F.).

All these soils lack gypsum influence.  Algerita soils have control sections with 10 to 20 percent carbonate clay.  Cronese soils do not have gypsum in the lower substratum and have 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Guijarral soils are dry from April to January. Kinley and Rillino soils contain 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control sections. Nikey soils have a calcic horizon at depths below 50 centimeters (20 inches) and contain more than 20 percent gravel.  Whitlock soils have calcic horizons at depths of 25 to 41 centimeters (10 to 16 inches). Wink soils have calcic horizons at 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 39 inches). Yippin soils have  calcic horizons at 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grapevine soils are on fan piedmonts and alluvial flats. These soils formed in mixed alluvium with some gypsum. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 520 to 1,100 meters (1,700 to 3,600 feet) in Nevada and 460 to 1,375 meters (1,500 to 4,500 feet) in Arizona. The climate is low latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 230 millimeters (4 to 9 inches); mean annual air temperature is 14 to 21 degrees C. (57 to 69 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 170 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aztec, Goodsprings and McCarran soils. Aztec and McCarran soils have gypsic horizons.  Goodsprings soils have petrocalcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderate permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
