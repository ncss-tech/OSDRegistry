GOLTRY SERIES

The Goltry series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian and alluvial sediments of Quaternary age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on high terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Psammentic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goltry fine sand, on a 0 to 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 358 m (1175 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 23 to 41 cm {9 to 16 in])

     E--30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; many fine roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Thickness of the E horizon is 20 to 91 cm [8 to 36 in])

     E and Bt1--76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist (E), single grain; loose; many uncoated sand grains; with lamellae of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand (B); the lamellae have weak subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; wavy and discontinuous 3 to 75 mm (0.12 to 3 in) thick, and 1.2 to 12.7 cm (0.5 to 5 in) apart; the lamellae have clay bridges between the sand grains; common fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redoximorphic depletions with clear boundaries; neutral; diffuse wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the E and Bt horizons is 50 to 130 cm [20 to 52 in])

     E and Bt2--127 to 203 cm (50 to 80 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist (E); single grain; loose; many uncoated sand grains; with lamellae of strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam (B); the lamellae have weak subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; wavy and discontinuous 3 to 75 mm (0.12 to 3 in) thick, and 2.5 to 12.7 cm (1 to 5 in) apart; the lamellae have bridges between the sand grains; common fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redoximorphic depletions with clear boundaries; moderately alkaline.

Aline, Eda and Eufaula soils: do not have wetness features or a wet season water table within 152 cm (60 in) of the surface, and are somewhat excessively drained  
Bienville soils: have siliceous mineralogy and an udic soil moisture regime  
Dougherty, Meno, and Stidham soils: have a loamy control section  
Eufaula soils: have siliceous mineralogy 
Likes and Tivoli soils: do not have an argillic horizon 
Nobscot soils: have a continuous vertical argillic horizon that is fine   sandy loam and is 20 cm (8 in) or more thick
