GREYBROOK SERIES

The Greybrook series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in lacustrine deposits. The soils are on dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

Crouse, Hickory, Kanawha, and Martinsville soils average more than 5 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section. Gallman soils have rock fragments of dominantly shale lithology in the lower part of the series control section. Princeton, Richardville, and Riddles soils average more than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Skelton soils have a reaction that is more acid than neutral in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Greybrook soils are on backslopes of dissected lake plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 18 to 35 percent. The soils formed in 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) of loess and in the underlying paleosol in lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 152 to 244 meters (500 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dubois, Haubstadt, Otwell and Peoga on lake plains. The somewhat poorly drained Dubois soils and the poorly drained Peoga soils are on flats. The moderately well drained Haubstadt soils are on summits and shoulders. The moderately well drained Otwell soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is high or very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for woodland. A few areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 114B in southern Indiana. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Owen County, Indiana, 1997.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (15 inches)(A1, A2, E, BE horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 157 cm (15 to 62 inches) (2Bt, 2Btg horizons).
Relic redoximorphic features: at 63 to 203 cm (25 to 80 inches). The mottles and matrix colors with chroma of 1 or 2 and the iron concentrations are relic features which do not indicate present drainage conditions.

These soils were mapped Otwell, calcareous substratum, in the 1964 Owen County Soil Survey.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE for the typical pedon S91IN-119-45.
