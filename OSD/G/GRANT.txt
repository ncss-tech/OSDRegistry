GRANT SERIES

The Grant series consist of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in material weathered predominantly from siltstone or silty shale of Permian age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils are on treads and risers of paleoterraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 813 mm (32 in) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

REMARKS: 
Major changes in the OSD were made by Walt Schaefer, as a result of the Soil Data Join Recorrelation Initiative (SDJR) in 06/2013. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) (Ap, A, and BA horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 41 to 81 cm (16 to 32 in) (Bt horizon) 
Paralithic contact: siltstone at a depth 150 cm (59 in) (Cr horizon) 

Edited 08/2017 (JAD-JLD) Changed to tabular format. Updated pedon description, range in characteristics, and other sections.
