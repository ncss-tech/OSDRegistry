GOLDYKE SERIES

The Goldyke series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Goldyke soils are on hills and pediments. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goldyke gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 30 percent angular rhyolite gravel.

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent fine and medium gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    C--8 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; 15 percent fine and medium gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 15 cm thick)

    Cr--15 to 56 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) highly weathered rhyolite bedrock, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist, common fine black mineral stains resembling redox concentrations; strong rock structure; common very fine and fine roots in cracks; few carbonate and silica coats in cracks and on undersides of fragments; violently effervescent. (25 to 76 cm thick)

    R--56 cm; fractured, hard rhyolite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; USGS Gabbs, NV topographic quadrangle;about 100 feet east of Highway 89; 300 feet north and 400 feet east of the southwest corner of section 32, T. 11  N., R. 36 E.; latitude 38 degrees 46 minutes 8 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 57 minutes 46 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.7692778 latitude, -117.962222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during the winter and early spring months, and for 10 to 20 days during July through October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 10 to 25 cm to a paralithic contact. 
Hard bedrock: Within 100 cm.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent gravel, lithology of fragments is volcanic rocks such as rhyolite and rhyolitic tuff.

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

C horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Texture: Sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent gravel.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

Cr layer
Ranges from soft, highly weathered material to hard, highly fractured bedrock yielding rock fragments that can be dug out with a spade.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birdsley, Celeton, Oceanet, Perlor, Roic, Slatery and Somorent series. 

Birdsley and Persayo soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section. Celeton soils have soft fragments of diatomaceous earth and do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Oceanet soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Perlor soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C., have up to 20 percent platy paragravel, and do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Roic soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section, have up to 50 percent paragravel within the control section, and do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Slatery soils have 15 to 20 percent pararock fragments in the control section and do not have hard bedrock within 100 cm. Somorent soils are deeper than 25 cm and lack hard bedrock within 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Goldyke soils are on hills and pediments. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite and rhyolitic tuff. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,300 to 1,890 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Singatse, Stewval, and  Theon soils.  Singatse soils are loamy-skeletal and are very shallow to lithic contacts.  Stewval soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, have argillic horizons, and are in an aridic moisture regime bordering xeric.  Theon soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Goldyke soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Bailey greasewood, galleta, spiny menodora, bud sagebrush, spiny hopsage, shadscale, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 27 and 29.
