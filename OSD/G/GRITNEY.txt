SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia, and possibly South Carolina  
Extent: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Holmes County Florida; l971.

REMARKS: 
Responsibility for Gritney series was transferred to North Carolina in l986.  The classification of this series was changed with the 12/86 revision from clayey, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludults to clayey, mixed, thermic Aquic Hapludults. This is based on selected water table studies. The November 2025 revision moved the type location from Northampton County, North Carolina to Halifax County, North Carolina to a more representative site.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0-6 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 107 centimeters (6 to 42 inches) (Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and iron depletions in the zone from 69 to 152 centimeters (27 to 60 inches) (Bt3, BC, and C horizons)
Characterization analysis for typical pedon (S85NC-131-1) was completed by NCSU.
