GARBUTT SERIES



The Garbutt series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan

terraces, basalt plains, and alluvial fans.  They formed in loess and

silty alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 12

percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the

average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

Torriorthents.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Garbutt silt loam - rangeland, on a 1 percent slope at

2,400 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise

noted.)



    A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark

brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium platy structure; slightly hard,

friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth

boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)



    C1--5 to 27 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam,

dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; violently

effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (16 to 30

inches thick)



    C2--27 to 38 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) very fine sandy loam,

grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, firm; violently

effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20

inches thick)



    C3--38 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam,

dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, firm; violently

effervescent; moderately alkaline.



TYPE LOCATION:  Owyhee County, Idaho; about 16 miles southwest of

Mountain Home; 2,200 feet north and 2,500 feet east of the southwest

corner of section 30, T.4S., R.4E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F

Control section-percent clay - 12 to 18

Texture - very fine sandy loam or silt loam

Reaction - mildly to strongly alkaline

Mineralogy - mixed with 1 or more layers having 20 to 50 percent

volcanic glass in the sand and silt fraction.



A horizon

Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y

Value - 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist

Chroma - 2 through 4



C horizons

Value - 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist

Chroma - 1 through 4

Calcium carbonate - 3 to 15 percent calcium carbonate



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Penoyer, Smaug, and Yipor series.

Penoyer, Smaug and Yipor soils lack layers with 20 to 50 percent

volcanic glass.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Garbutt soils are on alluvial fans, low terraces,

and basalt plains at elevations of 2,000 to 5,400 feet.  They formed in

alluvium dominantly from lacustrine siltstone.  Slopes are 0 to 12

percent.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  Average

annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110

to 165 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baldock, Bramwell,

Owyhee, Stanfield, and Turbyfill soils.  Baldock soils are fine-loamy

and have mottles above 20 inches.  Bramwell soils are fine-silty and

somewhat poorly drained.  Owyhee soils have cambic horizons and are 20

to 35 inches deep to laminated lacustrine sediments.  Stanfield soils

have duripans and Turbyfill soils are coarse-loamy.  Baldock and

Bramwell soils occur on lower, wetter landscape positions.  The other

associated soils are on landscape positions similar to Garbutt soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff;

moderate permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated areas are used for production of beans,

corn, alfalfa, sugar beets, small grains, hay and pasture.  Potential

vegetation in the natural plant community is winterfat, bud sagebrush,

shadscale, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, and Indian

ricegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern and south central Idaho and

eastern Oregon.  The soils are extensive.
