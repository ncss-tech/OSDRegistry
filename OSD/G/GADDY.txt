GADDY SERIES

The Gaddy series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium of Holocene age. These soils are on nearly level or very gently sloping flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Udic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Gaddy loamy fine sand, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 299 m, (980 ft)  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 50 cm [7 to 20 in])

  C1--20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; soft; common thin lenses of brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the C1 horizon is 0 to 38 cm [0 to 15 in])

  C2--51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grain; loose; common thin lenses of brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam; slightly effervescent moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma; about 2 miles east and 1 mile south of Shawnee; about 2,100 feet west and 200 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 28, T. 10 N., R. 4 E.

UTM Easting: 692297 m

UTM Zone: 14

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to bedrock: more than 203 cm (80 in)
Reaction and Effervescence: moderately alkaline and slightly effervescent, throughout the 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in) control section. 

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6 dry or moist
Texture: fine sand to loam 
Other features: Some pedons have mollic colors but do not meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon.

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist 
Chroma: 3 to 6 dry or moist
Texture: loamy fine sand or fine sand, stratified with thin lenses of fine sandy loam to clay loam.  The lenses are less than 2.5 cm (1 inch) thick, are darker in color, and contain more organic matter than the matrix.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Gad series in the same family.
Gad soils: are drier in the moisture control section for longer periods 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: sandy alluvium of Holocene age
Landform: nearly level or very gently sloping flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A)
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean Annual Precipitation: 737 to 1041 mm (29 to 41 in)
Mean Annual Soil Temperature: 15 to 17.2 degrees C (59 to 63 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 198 to 518 m (650 to 1700 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gracemore, Keokuk, Lomill, and Yahola series.
Gracemore soils: have a water table above a depth of 102 cm (40 in) and occur in slightly concave areas closer to the stream channel.
Keokuk soils: have a coarse-silty control section and occur on higher flood plains. 
Lomill soils: have a clayey over loamy control section and are on higher flood plains. 
Yahola soils: are coarse-loamy and usually occur farther from the stream channel and on slightly higher elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: somewhat excessively drained 
Permeability: moderately rapid to very rapid
Runoff: negligible	
Flooding: These soils are subject to occasional flooding for very brief periods mainly during March to October.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for tame pasture. Some areas are used for wheat, alfalfa, grain sorghum, and peanuts. Native vegetation is mostly eastern cottonwood, American elm, green ash, and pecan with an understory of big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and Indiangrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Oklahoma; LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). The series is moderately extensive
