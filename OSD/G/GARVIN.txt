GARVIN SERIES

The Garvin series consists of deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. These level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium sediments of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on narrow to broad nearly level alluvial plains in the Grand Prairie (MLRA 85), and the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Udertic Haplustolls
