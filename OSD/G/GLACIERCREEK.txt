GLACIERCREEK SERIES 

The Glaciercreek series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash or till.  Glaciercreek soils are on outwash terraces, kame terraces, stream terraces or moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Andic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Glaciercreek gravelly ashy silt loam, in coniferous forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly ashy silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots and few medium roots; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--2 to 14 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick) 

    2C1--14 to 44 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 30 inches thick) 

    2C2--44 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 75 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; moderate permeability to a depth of 14 inches and very rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Glaciercreek soils are used for timber production, recreation, watersheds, and as wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting of Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and ponderosa pine with an understory of dwarf huckleberry, common snowberry, and pinegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Glaciercreek soils are of moderate extent in western Montana. MLRA 43A and 44A.
