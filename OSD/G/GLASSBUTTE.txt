GLASSBUTTE SERIES

The Glassbutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolite. Glassbutte soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 20 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Argixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Glassbutte gravelly ashy fine sandy loam--on a hill sloping 30 percent to the north at an elevation of 1,542 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

      2Bk--58 to 117 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly ashy loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common fine, few medium tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 35 percent cobbles; secondary calcium carbonates segregated as many thin (<1 mm) coats on rock fragments and as few fine masses throughout the matrix; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 58 cm thick) 

      2Ck--117 to 155 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely cobbly ashy loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; secondary calcium carbonates segregated as few medium and coarse coats on bottoms of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Oregon; in the eastern Glass Buttes about 0.5 mile south of Wise Flat; approximately 600 feet south and 2,100 feet west of the northeast corner of section 34, T. 23 S., R. 23 E.; USGS Hat Butte 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 32 minutes 25 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 56 minutes 34 seconds W; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cabinspring, Cagas, Derallo, Jacksplace, Roughridge , and Slockey series. 

Cabinspring, Jacksplace, and Slockey soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Cagas soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Derallo soils are deep to paralithic contacts. Roughridge soils have 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and secondary silica cementation at a depth of 40 to 60 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Glassbutte soils are on hills and mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite or rhyodacite. Slopes are 20 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 1,415 to 1,895 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 meters, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Lambring soil. Lambring soils do not have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Glassbutte soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is low sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. Areas where these soils occur are adjacent to mineral claims where cinnabar (Mercury sulfide ore) was mined. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 1,400 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
