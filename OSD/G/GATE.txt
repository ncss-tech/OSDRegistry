4/2017--The Gate series was proposed as a result of an update project. The official series description was developed according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation and laboratory sampling of the alluvial fans and terraces at the interface of the hills and lowlands in MLRA 2 is recommended.
