GLADLOW SERIES

The Gladlow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium derived from shale.  These soils are on mountain slopes and mesas.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gladlow clay loam, on an east facing, simple, 27 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 7,800 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on June 11,1990.

    A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few very fine pores; 1 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--14 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 1 percent gravel; violently effervescent; visible carbonates in patches; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bky--24 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 5 percent shale fragments; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; visible carbonates in patches; visible gypsum crystals; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

    C--31 to 60 inches; variegated colors (due to parent material) of gray (10YR 6/1) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) and brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; 10 percent shale fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no competitors. Similar soils are the Sagedale and Widen series.

Sagedale:  have moist spring months with peak periods of precipitation in May and June.

Widen:  has a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived predominantly from shale
Landform:  mountain slopes and mesas
Slopes:  3 to 30 percent
Elevation: 7,400 to 8,500 feet
Mean annual temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  18 to 20 inches.
Precipitation pattern:
  Wettest months:  July and August receive slightly more precipitation than other months
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, however the soils are still moist from snowmelt.
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dolores, Narraguinnep,
and Ruko series.  The Dolores soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in
the particle size control section.  Narraguinnep soils have a thick
mollic epipedon.  Ruko soils have a paralithic contact at 10 to 20
inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gladlow soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is western wheatgrass, needlegrass, Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Gambel's oak, and mountain snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  The series is of small extent.
