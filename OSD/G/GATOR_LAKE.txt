Buffalo Tiger soils--lack limestone bedrock within 203 centimeters (80 inches) and occur in similar landform positions.
Coopertown soils--have limestone bedrock within 20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Loxahatche soils--are very deep, lack limestone substratum within 203 centimeters (80 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Macks Camp soils--have bedrock at depths of 91 to 130 centimeters (36 to 51 inches) and occur on similar landform positions. 
Plantation soils--have sandy layers below the organic layer and above the limestone bedrock.
Shark Valley soils--have bedrock at depths of 51 to 91 centimeters (20 to 36 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils--have subsurface horizons of freshwater marl that compose less than 1/2 the thickness of the control section and occur in similar landform positions.
