COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Florida Everglades and Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): Talfs, rises, and/or dips in freshwater marshes and swamps of the Everglades and depressions on flatwoods areas.   
Parent material: well decomposed organic materials overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean annual air temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C. (77 to 81 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 1,270 to 1,651 millimeters (50 to 65 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Buffalo Tiger soils have limestone bedrock at 150 to 200 centimeters (60 to 80 inches) and occur in similar landform positions.
Cooper Town soils have limestone bedrock within 18 to 50 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Loxahatche soils are very deep, lack limestone substratum within 200 centimeters (80 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Macks Camp soils have bedrock at depths of 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) and occur on similar landform positions. 
Plantation soils have sandy layers more than 25 centimeters (10 inches) thick below the organic layer and have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).
Shark Valley soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches), are stratified with calcareous silty marl materials, and occur in similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Moderately high to high
Surface Runoff: Negligible.
Flooding frequency and duration: Sawgrass plains are very frequently flooded for very long periods.  During the dry season or periods of drought these may not be flooded. In natural conditions, flooding occurs for very long duration of 9 to 11 months. Tree Islands are occasionally flooded for brief periods during periods of heavy rainfall, severe storms, and hurricanes. Currently flooding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.
Ponding frequency and duration: depressions on flatwoods areas are covered by water (ponded) very frequently for very long duration 9 to 11 months. 

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Dominant vegetation: sawgrass, sedges, lilies, spikerush, willow, elderberry, pond apple, and cypress.
