Yellowstone - medial-skeletal; 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat and watersheds. Potential native vegetation is Douglas fir, western hemlock, red huckleberry, western swordfern, baldhip rose, thimbleberry, salal, Pacific rhododendron, cascade Oregongrape, vine maple, common beargrass, evergreen violet and western brackenfern. Scattered amounts of noble fir, Pacific silver fir, and tall blue huckleberry may occur in some areas at the higher elevations within the frigid zone and are recognized as cool phases. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central portion of the Coast Range Mountains of Oregon; MLRA 1. The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Benton County, Oregon, 2004. The name is taken from Giveout Mountain in Tillamook County, Oregon. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Umbric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 16 inches (A horizon).
Cambic horizon - from depths of 16 to 36 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).
Andic soil properties - from the mineral soil surface to 36 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2 horizons). Based on lab data from associated soils and field observations.
Particle-size control section - from the mineral soil surface to 36 inches. 

Depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer. 

The Giveout series was originally recognized in the Tillamook County, Oregon Soil Survey. Due to its limited extent the tentative series was discontinued from use. The concept of this series was renewed in the Benton County, Oregon Soil Survey Update, and the series type location has been moved to Benton County.
