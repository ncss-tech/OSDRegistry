GRAMIL SERIES

The Gramil series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess and alluvium over lacustrine sediments. They are on lacustrine terraces. Permeability is very slow and slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gramil soils are on lacustrine terraces at elevations of 1,600  to 3,800 feet. These soils formed in loess and alluvium over lacustrine sediments. The slope range is 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches and the frost free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lewhand and Reggear series. Lewhand soils are on floodplains and have a fragipan above 20 inches. Reggear soils are on hills, have a fragipan at 20 to 40 inches and have mixed volcanic ash and loess in the epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; runoff is slow; permeability is very slow.  Some areas may have very brief, rare flooding from March to May.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for crop production and livestock grazing. The main crops are oats and hay; some wetter areas have very limited production of these crops. Potential native vegetation is grand fir, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, creambush oceanspray, snowberry and goldthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho; Gramil soils are not extensive.
