GARNE SERIES

The Garne series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with glauconitic sandstone on hills on bedrock controlled uplands. These soils formed in re-worked (by wind or water, or both) sandy outwash and in loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy residuum, and slow to moderate in the sandstone. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Garne loamy sand, on a convex, south-facing 4 percent slope, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 895 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

 A--10 to 18 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick) 

 AB--18 to 23 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick) 

 Bw1--23 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick) 

 2Bw2--27 to 34 inches; olive (5Y 5/3) very fine sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots; 10 percent sandstone channers; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick) 

 2Cr--34 to 48 inches; olive (5Y 4/4 and 5Y 5/4) and pale olive (5Y 6/4) weakly cemented fine-grained glauconitic sandstone bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Pepin County, Wisconsin; about 1 mile north and 4 miles east of Durand; about 2,000 feet north and 2,330 feet west of the southeast corner of section 18, T. 25 N., R. 12 W.; USGS Durand North topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 38 minutes 46 seconds N. and long. 91 degrees 52 minutes 56 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 15 to 35 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches. Garne soils typically have a paralithic contact (Cr horizon) of glauconitic sandstone 10 inches or more thick that grades to a lithic contact (R horizon) below 40 inches. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy residuum. 

The Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed. 

The A horizon has color like the Ap horizon. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed. 

The AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed. 

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed. 

The 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5G, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the channery analogs. It has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. Reaction naturally is moderately acid or slightly acid, but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed. 

The 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bw horizon above. It is glauconitic sandstone bedrock. 

The 2R horizon has color like the 2Bw horizon above. It is glauconitic sandstone bedrock. Some pedons do not have a 2R horizon. 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Fedji series. A related soil is the Urne series. Fedji soils do not have a paralithic contact within the series control section. Urne soils are coarse-loamy and do not have a mollic epipedon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Garne soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands. Slope gradients range from 2 to 12 percent. These soils formed in reworked (by wind or water, or both) sandy outwash and in loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 850 to 950 feet. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Finchford and Urne soils. The somewhat excessivley drained Urne soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Garne soils where the soil is loamy throughout over the glauconitic sandstone. The excessively drained Finchford soils are nearby on outwash terraces where the soil formed entirely in sandy outwash. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy residuum, and slow to moderate in the sandstone. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cropland. Corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay are the principal crops. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie with a few oak trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Wisconsin. These soils are of small extent.
