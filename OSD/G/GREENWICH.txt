SERIES ESTABLISHED: Calvert County, Maryland, 1942

REMARKS: The Greenwich series was originally established in Calvert County, Maryland, 1942. It was made inactive in 1957 and the soils combined with the Sassafras series in Maryland and Delaware. The series was reactivated in 1992 in Sussex County, DE because of important differences in use and management. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 cm (Ap horizon)
b. Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 74 cm (Bt horizons)

Other features identified with this pedon:
Series Control Section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm
