GRADE SERIES

The Grade series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite. These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 8 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.
