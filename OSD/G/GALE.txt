GALE SERIES

The Gale series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone. These soils are on hills of sandstone bedrock controlled uplands.  These soils formed mostly in loess underlain by siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 millimeters.  Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gale silt loam - on a convex north facing 15 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 305 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine to coarse roots; common fragments of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) subsoil; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 23 centimeters thick)

   Bt1--20 to 30 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine to coarse roots; common distinct dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  

   Bt2--30 to 56 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine to medium roots; many distinct dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

   Bt3--56 to 69 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine to medium roots; many distinct dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 23 to 76 centimeters.)

   2Bt4--69 to 79 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few distinct dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; common prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron coatings on faces of peds; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 centimeters thick)

   3C--79 to 99 centimeters; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sand; single grain; loose; few thin strata of yellowish red (5YR 5/8) loamy sand; about 10 percent sandstone channers; strongly acid.  (2 to 50 centimeters thick)

   3Cr--99 to 152 centimeters; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Tell series. 
Tell--do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 centimeters

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent Material--formed mostly in loess over siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone
Landform-- on hills on bedrock controlled uplands
Slope--0 to 60 percent
Elevation--213 to 427 meters
Mean annual air temperature8 to 11 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation762 to 838 millimeters
Frost Free Days--135 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hixton, Norden, and Seaton soils near the type location. 
Hixton--are nearby on landscape positions similar to those of the Gale soils, the loess mantle is thinner, and the family particle size class is fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal
Norden--are nearby on similar landscape positions, have more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine in the control section and the underlying sandstone is glauconitic
Seaton--are in similar landscape positions where the loess mantle is more than 60 centimeters thick and the family particle size class is fine-silty

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--well drained--a saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during April to June in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--4.23-14.11 micrometers per second (moderate)  
in the silty and loamy mantle, 42.34-141.14 micrometers per second (rapid) in the sandy residuum, and 1.41-14.11 micrometers per second (moderately slow or moderate)in the sandstone

USE AND VEGETATION:   Many of the less sloping areas are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  Other areas are used for woodland or pastureland.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.  Common trees are northern red oak, black oak, white oak, and shagbark hickory.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, 1940.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon include:  
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap);
argillic horizon-- the zone from a depth of 20 to 79 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4 horizons);
paralithic contact--99 centimeters (3Cr);
udic moisture regime; mesic soil temperature regime.

Angular sandstone flagstones and stones are on the surface in some areas and a stony phase is recognized.

Gale has been mapped on the Wonewoc Cambrian sandstone formation and the Ordovician St. Peter sandstone formation in Wisconsin. Future MLRA correlations may separate these mapunits by geologic formation. 

Small areas of Gale soils have been mapped in areas beyond the physiographic concept of the Gale series; future MLRA soil survey updates may investigate and re-correlate these areas.
