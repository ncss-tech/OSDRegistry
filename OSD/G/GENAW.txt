GENAW SERIES

The Genaw series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess mantled residuum from tuffaceous sediments.  Genaw soils are on summits, shoulders and side slopes of rolling hills, plateaus and rock pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Genaw very fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered by 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak moderately thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 18 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly very fine sandy loam,  brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular and interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    Btk--15 to 28 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; common thin and moderately thick clay films on peds faces and lining pores; carbonate is disseminated; slightly effervescent; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bqk--28 to 41 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; common fine and medium carbonate filaments, 10 percent weak durinodes; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 23 cm thick)

    Cr--41 cm; soft tuffaceous sediments.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 26 miles southwest of Battle Mountain, about 800 feet north and 2,400 feet west of the southeast corner of section 6, T. 27 N., R. 42 E.; USGS Fish Creek Basin 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 14 minutes and 13 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 17 minutes and 45 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.2313889 latitude, -117.2908333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 36 to 50 cm.
Other features: Thin Bt horizons are above the Btk in some pedons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 30 percent
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, dominantly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Btk or Bt horizons (when present)
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Loam or clay loam.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.
Carbonates:  Noneffervescent through strongly effervescent
Structure:  Angular or subangular blocky
Consistence:  Very friable or friable, moist.

Bqk horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 through 6.
Texture:  Sandy loam or loam.
Rock fragments:  25 to 50 percent, mainly gravel.
Cementation:  5 to 15 percent weak discontinuous cementation or weakly cemented durinodes.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anowell, Chill, Corral, Ulida and Yuko series.  

Anowell, Chill and Yuko soils have paralithic contacts at less than 36 cm.  Corral soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the Bt horizon. Ulida soils lack durinodes.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Genaw soils are on hills, plateaus and rock pediment summits, shoulders, and stable side slopes.  These soils formed in loess mantled residuum derived from tuffaceous sediments.  Elevations are 1,340 to 2,110 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coztur, Perlor and Puett soils.  Coztur soils have a frigid soil temperature regime. Perlor and Puett soils lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, spiny hopsage and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Nevada.  Genaw soils are of small extent.  MLRA 23,24 and 28B.
