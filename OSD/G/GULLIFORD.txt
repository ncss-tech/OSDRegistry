SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, Oregon; 2018

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Particle size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

The Gulliford soils are saturated with flowing water, without reduction, within 30 cm of the soil surface 30 days or more during spring runoff. The depth of the water fluctuates with streamflow. Although the soils consist of fluvial material, the sand and rock fragments in the lower part are thought to be void of the organic carbon needed to meet the criteria for a Fluvent.
