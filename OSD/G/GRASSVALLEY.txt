GRASSVALLEY SERIES

The Glassvalley series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Grassvalley soils are on lake terraces.  Elevations are 3,200 to 3,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches, much of which fall as snow and as spring rain.  Mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 105 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grassvalley soils are used for irrigated and dryland crops and as pastureland and rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, needleandthread, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Grassvalley soils are of small extent in valleys of western Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Missoula County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 9 inches (Ap horizon); an argillic horizon from 9 to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons); a particle-size control section that is the argillic horizon from 9 to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons).  Grassvalley soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
