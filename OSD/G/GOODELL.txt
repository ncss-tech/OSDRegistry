GOODELL SERIES

The Goodell series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash overlying sandy outwash and loamy till on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Darfur, Dassel, Gilford, Hanska, Jubilee, Lyles, Monon, Mudgepond, Overshue, Toolesboro, Uniongrove, and Whitepost series. Darfur soils averages more than 85 percent fine sand or very fine sand in the particle-size control section. Dassel soils have hue yellower than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section. Gilford, Hanska, and Toolesboro soils have horizons with more than 70 percent sand throughout the lower part of the series control section. Jubilee soils have a high mica content within the series control section and have an aridic moisture regime during the growing season. Lyles and Whitepost soils do not have dominant textures of loam or fine sandy loam in the lower part of the series control section. Monon soils do not have a lithologic contact with till within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Mudgepond soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Overshue soils have hue yellower than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section and are in a climate the mean annual precipitation is less than 76 cm (30 inches). Uniongrove soils are deeper than 127 cm (50 inches) to the base of the cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Goodell soils are on nearly level or depressional areas on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Goodell soils formed in loamy outwash overlying sandy outwash and loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brady, Brookston, Bronson, Budd, Gilford, and Rensselaer soils. The somewhat poorly drained Brady, Budd, and the moderately well drained Bronson soils are on swells. The poorly drained Brookston soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Rensselaer soils are on similar landscapes. The Brookston and Rensselaer soils have argillic horizons. The Gilford soils do not have loamy till within the series control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the outwash and moderately high in the loamy till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper loamy outwash, rapid in the sandy outwash, and moderately slow in the loamy till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly cropped. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, wheat, and oats. Native vegetation is marsh grasses, reeds, sedges, pin oak, and red maple forests.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pulaski County, Indiana, 2001.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap, A horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 81 cm (12 to 32 inches) (Bg horizon).
Aquic conditions: chroma of 2 or less in all horizons below the mollic epipedon.

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 155019 represents the typical pedon in complex with Gilford soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for typical pedon (S98IN131-013) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T98IN-131-122) for the typical pedon is on file in the MLRA project office in Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 80 percent Goodell soils and 20 percent Gilford, till substratum.
