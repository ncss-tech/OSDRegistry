GERRISH SERIES

The Gerrish series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy glacial material on outwash plains, kame moraines and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C (42 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Lamellic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Gerrish sand, on a 3 percent slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 2 cm (1 inch); black (7.5YR 2.5/1) sand, dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many very fine and common fine and medium roots; 2 percent gravel; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [2 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 E--2 to 8 cm (1 to 3 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/2) sand, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; weak medium granular structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; common very fine and fine, and many medium roots; 6 percent gravel; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 8 cm (3 inches) thick]

 Bw1--8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) gravelly sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; 16 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; 33 percent gravel and 7 percent cobbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw3--51 to 66 cm (20 to 26 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very gravelly sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine roots; 33 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of Bw horizon is 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches).]

 E and Bt--66 to 203 cm (26 to 80 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand (E); lamellae of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand (Bt); single grain; loose; lamellae are 3 to 6 mm (1/16 to 1/4 inch) in thickness with a total accumulation of 10 cm (4 inches); 1 percent gravel; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Roscommon County, Michigan; about 1300 feet north and 1950 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 25, T. 21 N, R. 3 W.; USGS Meredith NW, Michigan, topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 10 minutes 45 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 37 minutes 7 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the lamellae: 51 to more than 102 cm (20 to more than 40 inches)
Rock fragment content: 15 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles in the upper part of the series control section, and 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles in the lower part 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: sand or gravelly sand
Reaction: extremely acid to slightly acid

E horizon, when present:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 6
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sand or gravelly sand
Reaction: extremely acid to slightly acid

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 4 to 8
Texture: dominantly gravelly sand or very gravelly sand but also includes individual strata of extremely gravelly sand, cobbly sand or very cobbly sand
Reaction: very strongly acid to slightly acid

E part of the E and Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 3 to 6
Bt part: consists of lamella
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: loamy sand lamella 2 to 13 mm (1/16 to 1/2 inch) thick with a total accumulation of the lamella of less than 15 cm (6 inches)
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

C horizon, where present within the series control section:
Texture: sand or sand with stratified gravel

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Eagleview, Faunce, Grettum, and Zimmerman series. Eagleview and Grettum soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Faunce soils have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Zimmerman soils have fine sand textures throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gerrish soils are on outwash plains, kame moraines, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. These soils formed in sandy glacial material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. Elevation is 183 to 488 meters (600 to 1,600 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grayling, Graycalm, Klacking, Croswell, Au Gres, Deford, Leafriver, Tawas, Dawson, Lupton, and Loxley soils. The very poorly drained Deford, Leafriver, Tawas, Dawson, Lupton, and Loxley soils occur in low adjacent depressions and drainageways. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and moderately well drained Croswell soils occur on lower footslopes and toeslopes. The excessively drained Grayling and somewhat excessively drained Graycalm, and well drained Klacking soils occur on similar landform positions

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Potential surface runoff is negligible to low depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is in forestland. Forest vegetation includes red oak red maple, bigtooth aspen and white pine and lesser amounts of jack pine and black oak. A smaller part is in permanent pasture. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 98 in the central northern part of Lower Michigan. This series is of small extent.
