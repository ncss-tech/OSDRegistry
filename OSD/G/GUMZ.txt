GUMZ SERIES

The Gumz series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash overlying loamy till on outwash plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Gumz fine sandy loam, on a less than 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 219 meters (718 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few very fine and fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--23 to 30 cm (9 to 12 inches); black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate thick platy and moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine and fine roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 inches).]

 Bg1--30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and common medium faint brown (10YR 4/3) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

[Combined thickness of Bg horizon is 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inches).]

 C1--64 to 107 cm (25 to 42 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 C2--107 to 127 cm (42 to 50 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sand; single grain; loose; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the C horizon is 0 to 76 cm (30 inches).]

 2Cg--127 to 203 cm (50 to 80 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam; massive; firm; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Granby, Kentland, Loup, and Maumee series. Granby and Maumee soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity with till in the lower part of the series control section. Kentland soils have an organic layer in the middle part of the series control section. Loup soils are in areas that receive less than 762 mm (30 inches) of mean annual precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Gumz soils are on outwash and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Gumz soils formed in sandy outwash overlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 396 meters (600 to 1,300 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brems, Gilford, Goodell, and Morocco soils, and the competing Granby and Maumee soils. The moderately well drained Brems and somewhat poorly drained Morocco soils are on swells in the landform. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford, Goodell, Granby, and Maumee soils are on similar landforms as the Gumz soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately low in the till. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and slow in the till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly used to grow corn and soybeans. Some small areas are in small grains, hay, permanent pasture, and woodland. Native vegetation is marsh grass, sedges, oak, silver maple, and elm.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pulaski County, Indiana, 2001.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap and A horizons).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present immediately below the mollic epipedon and in all underlying horizons.

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 155028 represents the typical pedon in complex with Maumee soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S99IN-131-004) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data for the typical pedon (T99IN-131-021) is on file in the MLRA project office in Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 50 percent Gumz soils and 50 percent Granby soils.
