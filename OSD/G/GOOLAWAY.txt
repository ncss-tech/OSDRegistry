GOOLAWAY SERIES

The Goolaway series consists of moderately deep, well drained
soils that formed in colluvium weathered from schist.  Goolaway
soils are on mountains and have slopes of 12 to 50 percent.  The
mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean
annual precipitation is about 50 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Goolaway silt loam on a 40 percent north slope in
a forested area of 2,380 feet elevation.  (Colors are for a moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

O--2 inches to 0; partially decomposed leaves, needles and
twigs.

A--0 to 3 inches; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) silt
loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly
plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; base saturation is 49 percent; medium acid (pH 5.7);
abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

BA--3 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam,
light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; moderate fine subangular
blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many very fine and fine roots and common medium
and coarse; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent soft gravel;
base saturation is 37 percent; medium acid (pH 5.9); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick)

Bt1--11 to 25 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silt loam, light
olive gray (5Y 6/2) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular
blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium and
coarse; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay
films on ped faces and in pores; 5 percent soft gravel; base saturation is 74 percent; medium acid (pH 5.7); clear irregular boundary.  (11 to 19 inches thick)

Bt2--25 to 29 inches; olive (5Y 4/3) silt loam, pale olive
(5Y 6/3) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky
structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few
very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few moderately
thick clay films on ped faces and in pores; 10 percent soft
weathered gravel; base saturation is 78 percent; medium acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

Cr--29 inches; highly decomposed schist.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Oregon; about 2 miles east of
Battle Mountain; approximately 2,340 feet east and 1,510 feet
south of the northwest corner of sec. 5, T. 34 S., R. 3 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are
dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days
or more in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The
mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay, 0
to 10 percent soft gravel and less than 15 percent coarser than
very fine sand.  The base saturation is 40 to 60 percent by
ammonium acetate throughout the upper 20 inches of the solum.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist
and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5
or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Goolaway series consists of moderately
deep, well drained soils on mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from schist.  Elevations are 1,500 to 4,000
feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot
dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.
The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The
frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.  Slopes range from 12 to 50 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beekman,
Colestine, Lettia, Musty, Pollard and Siskiyou soils.  Beekman
and Musty soils are loamy-skeletal.  Colestine and Lettia soils
are fine-loamy and have hues of 10YR and 7.5YR.  Siskiyou soils
are coarse-loamy.  Pollard soils are fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production.  Native vegetation is Douglas fir, sugar pine, incense cedar,
canyon live oak, common snowberry, and deerfoot vanillaleaf.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
