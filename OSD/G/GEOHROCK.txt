GEOHROCK SERIES 

The Geohrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustalfs

(5 to 28 inches thick) 

    C2--45 to 60 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent angular gravel; disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Geohrock soils are used mainly for rangeland. Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, needleandthread, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Geohrock soils are moderately extensive in Southwestern Montana.  MLRAs - 43B, 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1979.   

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - from 4 to 18 inches (Bt, Btk horizons)
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - from 18 to 40 inches (Btk, Bk1, Bk2 horizons)

Geohrock soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil interpretation records - MT0612, MT0504.  

Classification changed from Borollic Haplargids to Typic Eutroboralfs in 1994; changed to Aridic Haplustalfs in 1997.

Additional Information: Because the calcium carbonate equivalent in the Bk horizons ranges from 3 to 15% and clay ranges from 10 to 25%, this soil requires further investigation as to whether it has a calcic horizon.
