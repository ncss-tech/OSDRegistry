GARMORE SERIES

The Garmore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in friable, loam or clay loam till. These soils are on plane or slightly convex slopes on intermediate levels of uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clarion, Faxon, Nicollet, and Rolfe soils.
Clarion--are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a mollic epipedon less than 50 centimeters thick
Faxon--are on lower landscape positions on plane or slightly concave slopes on rock-cored terraces or structural benches and have limestone bedrock within a depth of 100 centimeters
Nicollet--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Garmore soils and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.45 and 1 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Rolfe--are on slightly lower landscape positions in depressions, are frequently saturated from the surface of the soil to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation and have a clay content of 35 to 45 percent in the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--in a natural condition, a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 1 and 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10.0 micrometers per second

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Humboldt County, Iowa, 1958.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 53 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 53 to 158 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The Garmore series was set up originally to describe areas where bedrock was within 15 feet or so of the surface, but is this is not series criteria. 

Differentia between Garmore series and Ridgeton series needs further study.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
