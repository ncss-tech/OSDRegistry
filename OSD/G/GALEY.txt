GALEY SERIES

The Galey series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping convex terraces of uplands in the Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A and MLRA 84B).  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 37 inches. Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Ultic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Galey loamy fine sand--cultivated.(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

   E--6 to 14 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

   Bt1--14 to 34 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable; clay films on faces of peds, in pores, and bridging sand grains; moderately acid; diffuse smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick)

   Bt2--34 to 52 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; common coarse distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable; clay films on faces of peds, in pores, and bridging sand grains; moderately acid; diffuse smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

   Bt3--52 to 72 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) sandy clay loam, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) moist; common coarse distinct gray (10YR 5/1), pale brown (10YR 6/3) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and depletions; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, friable; patchy clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; few clean sand grains; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pontotoc County, Oklahoma; about 12 miles northwest of Ada; 2,300 feet south and 100 feet east of the northwest corner of sec.  26, T. 5 N., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Combined thickness of the A and E horizons range from 4 to 20 inches.

The Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly to slightly acid.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture and reaction are the same as the A horizon.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, gray, or brown occur in the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons.  Texture of the Bt horizon is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction of the Bt horizons is strongly acid to neutral. 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Galey soils are on nearly level to sloping convex terraces of uplands in the Cross Timbers.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  The climate is dry subhumid or moist subhumid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 44 to 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Konawa, Dougherty, Eufaula, Stidham, and Vanoss soils.  Konawa soils occur on similar areas or on side slopes below the Galey soils.  Dougherty, Eufaula, and Stidham soils have A and E horizons that combined are more than 20 inches thick and usually occur on slightly lower areas.  In addition, Eufaula soils have siliceous mineralogy and have a sandy control section.  Vanoss soils have a mollic epipedon and have a fine-silty control section.  In addition, Vanoss soils occur on prairie areas similar to the Galey soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; negligible to medium runoff; and moderate permeability.  These soils have a perched water table between 4 and 6 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for tame pasture.  Some of the less sloping areas are cultivated to small grains, peanuts, or grain sorghums.  Some of the more sloping areas are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is mainly post oak, blackjack oak, and hickory trees with an understory of tall and mid grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cross Timbers of Oklahoma and Texas. The series is of moderate extent.
