COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 500 to 1200 meters (1640 to 3935 ft)
Parent material: organic material over silty loess
Landform: peat mounds in depressions and till plains
Slopes: 0 to 6 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 300 to 500 mm (12 to 20 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -4 to -2 degrees C (25 to 28 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 45 to 75 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahtell, Chelina, and Mire series.
Ahtell soils have folistic and umbric epipedons, and occur on hill tops, and hillside positions.
Chelina soils have a cambic horizon and occur on lacustrine terraces.
Mire soils are very poorly drained, have a thick sapric horizon, and occur on string bogs, interdrumlins, hillslopes, and glacial valley floors.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high in the Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons, moderately high in the C horizon.
Permeability: very rapid in the Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons, moderate in the C horizon.
Runoff: negligible

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Use: wildlife habitat, recreation, and subsistence
Native vegetation: water sedge, marsh labrador tea, bog blueberry, white cottongrass

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228 Interior Alaska mountains.
Extent: limited
