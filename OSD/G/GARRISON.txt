GARRISON SERIES

The Garrison series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in glacial outwash with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Garrison soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments and have slopes of 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches (535mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F (9.4 degrees C.).

Lower part of some pedons have Bk or Bq horizons 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Borgeau, Emily, Lenz, Louiecreek, Opportunity, Raisio, Sinlahekin, Speigle, Vanbrunt and Whitestone series. Borgeau soils: are more than 150cm to sandy-skeletal material. 
Emily soils: have more than 27 percent clay in the subsoil. 
Lenz soils: are moderately deep to a lithic contact. 
Louiecreek soils: do not have a sandy skeletal subsoil 
Opportunity soisl: are more than 90 cm deep to sandy-skeletal material. 
Raisio soils: are moderately deep to a lithic contact. 
Sinlahekin soils: have a 2Bk horizon and are 88 to 150 cm deep to sandy-skeletal material 
Speigle soils: do not have a sandy skeletal subsoil 
Vanbrunt soils: are moderately deep to a lithic contact. 
Whitestone soils: are formed in granitic colluvium and are 100 to 150 cm deep to sandy-skeletal material. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Garrison soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces and terrace escarpments at elevations of 1,035 to 2,800 feet (315 to 855 m). Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The soils formed in outwash of mixed mineralogy with component of loess or volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. (9.4 degrees C). The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 25 inches (280 to 635 mm). The frost-free season is about 100 to 170 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedonia, Hallcreek, Hunters, Inchelium, Phoebe, Scala, and Springdale soils. Cedonia soils are fine-silty, do not have a mollic epipedon, and are on lake terraces. Hallcreek soils are sandy-skeletal, have a mantle of volcanic ash 18 to 36 cm thick, and are on outwash terraces. Hunters soils are fine-silty and are on terrace risers and treads. Inchelium soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick, are coarse-silty, and are on terraces. Phoebe soils are coarse-loamy and are on outwash terraces. Scala soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are coarse-loamy, and are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Springdale soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are sandy-skeletal, and are on terraces and terrace breaks. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated and non-irrigated cropland, urban development, grazing, and timber production. Cultivated areas are used for the production of alfalfa, grass seed, and small grain. The potential natural vegetation is scattered ponderosa pine with an understory of snowbrush ceanothus, common snowberry, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, lupine, rose, threadleaf sedge, and phlox. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Washington and northern Idaho. MLRA 43A, 44A. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stevens County, Washington, 1913. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 40 cm (Ap and A horizons) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 40 to 61 cm (Bw horizon) 
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 40 cm (Ap and A horizons) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A horizon, the Bw and part of the C horizon) with a weighted average of 39 percent rock fragments. 

The boundary transition between the Bw and C horizon is more than 12.5 cm and does not meet contrasting family criteria. In addition, the Bw horizon contains more than 50 percent fine sand and coarser and therefore does not meet the loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal contrasting particle-size class. 

Garrison soils mapped in Kootenai County, ID., should be further investigated to determine surface texture (ashy silt loam vs. ashy loam). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for this soil; NSSL pedon numbers 99P331, 99P332 and 08N0409.
