GEBSON SERIES

The Gebson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium.  These soils are on fan remnants or pediments. Slopes are 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

(combined thickness of the Bk horizons is greater than 50 inches)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Accola, Elispring, Glentivar, Madigan, Michelson, Monida, Morset, Northorn, Oro Fino, and Philipsburg series.
 Accola soils have an O horizon, and have an ustic regime that does not border aridic.
 Elispring, Glentivar, Madigan soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.
 Michelson soils have a lithologic discontinuity.
 Monida soils have a xeric moisture regime.
 Morset soils are not well separated; they are not moist in the soil moisture control section in summer and early fall (have a sagebrush plant community).
 Oro Fino soils are sandy in the lower Bk horizon.
 Philipsburg soils have an ustic regime that does not border aridic, and are not moist in summer and early fall.
 Northorn soils have a udic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium and/or slope alluvium from mixed sources, slope alluvium derived from volcanic breccia
Landform: fan remnants, pediments
Slopes: 1 to 25 percent

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Moffat County (Moffat County Area), Colorado, 1992. The type location is in the Teller-Park Area soil survey, where this soil was proposed in 1984.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 6 to 11 inches. (Bt horizon)
Mollic epipedon: from 0 to 11 inches. (A, Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon: from 6 to 11 inches. (Bt horizon)
Calcic horizon: from 11 to 29 inches. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Secondary carbonates: from 11 to 60 inches. (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)
Cryic temperature regime.

The classification when established was fine-loamy, mixed Argic Cryoborolls. Years later it was discovered that the typical pedon did not have an epipedon thick enough for a mollic epipedon, and the classification was changed to Ustollic Haplocryalfs. During the correlation of the Teller-Park Area in 2010, the type location was moved to a pedon that better represented the original concept of this series, and the classification changed to Calcic Argicryolls.

The concept of this series is restricted to grassland plant communities that do not have a significant big sagebrush component. The Gebson series is in areas that do not receive large amounts of winter precipitation and are strongly affected by monsoon rains falling in late July and August; these areas typically do not support big sagebrush. The soil correlated to Gebson in northwest Colorado is no longer considered within the series concept.
