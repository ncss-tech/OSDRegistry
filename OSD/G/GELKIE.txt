GELKIE SERIES

The Gelkie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Gelkie soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amsden, Barbarela, Cific, Coldspring, Croftshaw, Dewville, Gebson, Highrye, Hooligan, Inchau, Kezar, Leavitt, Lucky, Lymanson, Miracle, Monaberg, Morset, Passcreek, Rainbolt, Tripit, Wellsville, Woosley, Youga, and Zade soils.
Amsden and Coldspring soils have a Bt horizon with hue of 5YR or redder.
Barbarela, Cific, Hooligan, Inchau, Lymanson, Rainbolt, Tripit, and Zade soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.
Croftshaw and Youga soils do not have a horizon of secondary carbonates.
Dewville soils do not have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.
Gebson soils have sola to the base of the diagnostic Bt of 20 inches or less thickness.
Highrye soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.
Kezar, Lucky, Miracle, Passcreek, and Woosley soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.
Leavitt, Morset, and Wellsville soils have less than 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the argillic and C horizons.
Monaberg soils are noncalcareous throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gelkie soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from sandstone and silt stone.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches.  Frost-free period is 55 to 75 days.  Elevation is 7,900 to 9,500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coutis, Feltonia, and Silvercliff soils in nearby landscapes.  Coutis soils occur in drainageways below the Gelkie soils.  They lack an argillic horizon.  Feltonia soils are on fans below the Gelkie soils and they have a thicker mollic epipedon, more sand, and a calcic horizon.  Silvercliff soils are on terrace escarpments and side slopes below the Gelkie soils.  They have more than 35 percent coarser fragments and a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to low runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland.  Native vegetation consists of Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Parry's oatgrass, slender wheatgrass, and some western wheatgrass.  When the range deteriorates blue grama, Kentucky bluegrass, and fringed sage are common.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and southern Colorado in MLRA 48A and 48B.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jackson County, Colorado; 1973. The original type location was in Sublette County Wyoming; it was moved to Custer County, Colorado in 1978.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon:  from 0 to 15 inches.  (A1, A2, and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon:  from 15 to 40 inches.  (Bt, Btk horizons)
Secondary carbonate accumulations: from 28 to 45 inches (Btk, Bk horizons)
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 15 to 35 inches.  (upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon)

Classification of the Gelkie series when established was fine-loamy, mixed Argic Cryoborolls.

The 03/2007 revision narrows the series to its original landforms and parent material. Soils on mountains and glacial moraines are no longer considered within the series. Also excluded from the series are soils with peak periods of moisture in spring and early summer, which typically have sagebrush plant communities.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
