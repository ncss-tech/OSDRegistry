COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grabbler soils are on alluvial fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,524 to 1,829 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lonecabin, Lousight and Toejom soils. Lonecabin soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Lousight soils have an aridic soil moisture regime, less than 10 percent clay in the particle size control section and have no argillic horizon. Toejom soils have less than 10 percent clay in their particle size control section, an ochric epipedon and paralithic contact at depths of 36 to 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 76 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between March and July. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between December and September.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Grabbler soils are used for livestock grazing, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly Nevada bluegrass, sedge, meadow barley, rush and perennial forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range and in the western part of the Great Basin. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
