GROVELAND SERIES

The Groveland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic rock. These soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants and valley floors in intermontane basins. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

Fuertes (CO) - does not have a calcic horizon.
Millburne (WY) - has an aridic soil moisture regime that borders on ustic.
Voldseth (MT) - has a loamy-skeletal subsoil. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: alluvium or colluvium derived from sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rock
Landform: stream terraces, fan remnants, and valley floors
Slope: 0 to 8 percent
Elevation: 1,350 to 1,950 meters
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; short summers
Mean annual temperature: 3 to 7 degrees C. 
Mean annual precipitation: 350 to 480 millimeters 
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation falls most during spring and early summer 
Frost-free period: 70 to 90 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Voldseth, Hereimcreek, Martinsdale, and Meagher soils.  The Voldseth soils have a loamy-skeletal subsoil and are on similar positions.  The Hereimcreek soils have gleyed horizons and are on terrace treads and drainageways.  Martinsdale and Meagher soils do not have redox features.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Groveland soils are used for rangeland and irrigated and nonirrigated cropland. The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, green needlegrass, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Groveland soils are of small extent in west-central Montana. MLRA 44B, 46

SERIES PROPOSED: Meagher County, Montana 2007.  The Groveland name is a named railway stop on the Groveland Topographic Quadrangle. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 28 cm (Ap and Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon from 12 to 60 cm (Bt and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon from 60 to 102 cm (Bk horizon)
Particle-size control section from 12 to 60 cm (Bt and Btk horizons)

Groveland soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
