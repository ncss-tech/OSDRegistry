GRATTAN SERIES

The Grattan series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy drift on lake plains, outwash plains, moraines, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 mm (35 in), and mean annual temperature is about 9.0 degrees C (48 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Entic Haplorthods 

TYPICAL PEDON: Grattan sand, on a 3 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of about 207 meters (679 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 8 cm (3 in); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common medium and fine roots; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [2.5 to 13 cm (1 to 5 in) thick] 

    E--8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; single grain; loose; common fine roots; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. [5 to 23 cm (2 to 9 in) thick] 

    Bs1--15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in); dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

    Bs2--46 to 81 cm (18 to 32 in); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sand; single grain; loose; about 3 percent fine gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bs horizons is 20 to 106 cm (8 to 42 in).] 

    C--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose; about 1 percent fine gravel; moderately acid.

Some pedons have loam or clay loam material at depths greater than 102 cm (40 in). 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lynnwood series. Lynnwood soils were formed under higher annual precipitation with a mean annual of greater than 1,020 mm (40 in).  The closely related Copemish soils are in the ortstein family, and have an ortstein content of greater than 50 percent in the Bs horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Grattan soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, moraines, or beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Grattan soils formed in sandy drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 508 to 914 mm (20 to 36 in). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). The difference between mean annual summer and mean annual winter temperature ranges from 6.1 to 15.0 degrees C (43 to 59 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chelsea, Covert, Granby, Kaleva,  Kingsville, Oakville, Plainfield, and Pipestone soils. Covert, Granby, Kingsville, and Pipestone soils form a common drainage sequence with Grattan soils. The moderately well drained Covert and somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils are on nearly level areas of the landscape while the very poorly drained Kingsville and Granby soils are in depressional areas. Chelsea, Kaleva, Oakville, and Plainfield soils are common associates and are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Much of the Grattan soil was cleared at one time and used for pasture or cropland. Much is idle or in pine plantations. Specialty crops are grown on intensively managed areas. Native vegetation is dominantly quaking aspen, eastern white pine, red maple, white oak, northern red oak, and black oaks. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 97, 98, 99, and 142 in Lower Michigan and New York. The series is of large extent with over 130,000 acres mapped.

REMARKS: The concept of some pedons having a Bhs horizon in the Grattan series has been changed. This is now the Kaleva series. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
1. Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 8 cm (3 in) (A horizon). 
2. Albic horizon: from a depth of 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in) (E horizon). 
3. Spodic horizon: from a depth of 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) (Bs1 horizon).
