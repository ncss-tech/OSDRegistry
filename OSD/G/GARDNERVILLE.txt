GARDNERVILLE SERIES

The Gardnerville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Gardnerville soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Nodur series.  Nodur soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C and do not have redox concentrations or endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gardnerville soils are on stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with minor surface additions of eolian material.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,405 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dangberg, Fettic, Ormsby, and Turria soils.  Dangberg soils are moderately deep to duripans.  Fettic soils are fine-silty.  Ormsby soils are sandy and do not have natric horizons.  Turria soils are fine-loamy and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between 122 and 150 cm (deep internal free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common or Persistent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gardnerville soils are used for livestock grazing and urban development.  Small areas are cropped to alfalfa hay, small grains, and grass-legume hay.  The present vegetation in rangeland is mainly basin big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, black greasewood, bottlebrush squirreltail, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled in 1959 and characterized by the soil survey laboratory in Riverside, CA as sample number S59Nev-3-1.  A separate adjacent pedon was also sampled as sample number S59Nev-3-2.  Data for both pedons is published in SSIR Report No. 23.
