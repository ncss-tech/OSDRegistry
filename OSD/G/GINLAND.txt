GINLAND SERIES

The Ginland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified stream alluvium.  Ginland soils are on flood plains and have 0 to 1 percent slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, calcareous, hyperthermic Vertic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ginland clay - cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ap--0 to 13 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick) 

    A--13 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; many fine roots; common and fine tubular pores; few calcium carbonate filaments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 22 inches thick)

    2Btkb1--24 to 35 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay bridges; common fine irregular calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 12 inches thick)

    2Btkb2--35 to 56 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few fain clay bridges; common fine irregular calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 24 inches thick)

    2Btk3--56 to 60 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay bridges; common fine irregular calcium carbonate masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  1500 feet south and 500 feet east of the northwest corner of section 36, T. 6 S., R. 6 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-August and December-January.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature - 72 to 78 degrees F.

Rock fragments - 0 to 5 percent; less than .5 inch diameter

Depth to contrasting material - 20 to 39 inches

Reaction - Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline

Soil Cracking - Cracks are 1 cm or more wide at 20 inches for extended periods each year

Shrink-swell - COLE of 0.05 or more in the upper 20 to 39 inches

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 5 to 15 percent

A or C horizon
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture:  Clay, silty clay  (40 to 55 percent clay)

2B horizon
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist
Chroma:  2 through 8, dry or moist
Texture:  Clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam  (20 to 30 percent clay)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ginland soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in stratified stream alluvium from granite, schist, rhyolite and basic igneous rocks.  Elevations are 500 to 2000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 250 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cashion, Gadsden and Glenbar soils.  Gadsden and Glenbar soils do not have a strongly contrasting particle-size class and buried B horizons.  Glenbar soils also average less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Cashion soils do not have buried B horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for growing irrigated cotton and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA is 40.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Pinal County, Arizona, Western Part; 1984.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Contrasting material - 20 to 39 inches of Holocene alluvium overlying a Pleistocene age buried soil that has an argillic horizon.

Entisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons

Vertic subgroup - COLE of 0.05 or more and cracks each year
