Where drained, these areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans.  Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture. The native vegetation is herbaceous marsh species tolerant of excessive wetness such as, cattails, bulrushes, giant burreed, giant reed grass and hydrophytic sedges.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dakota County, Minnesota, 1945.

REMARKS:

MLRA SSO 10-5 (Albert Lea, Minnesota).

Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon-the zone from the surface to a depth of 99 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 99 to 127 centimeters (Bg horizon); 
cumulic subgroup-mollic epipedon is more than 60 centimeters thick;
aquic moisture regime-low chroma immediately below the A horizons.

Formerly a stratified substratum phase with silt loam, sand, sandy loam, and loamy sand textures below 102 centimeters was included with this series. However, with changes in the latest Soil Taxonomy extending the series control section to 150 centimeters, another series (Shandep) with similar properties would best fit this concept.

The type location was moved from Steele County, Minnesota to Jackson County, Minnesota in 5/09 to clearly describe the series concept within the MLRA.

Based on current investigations, elevation range in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meters above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296 has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
