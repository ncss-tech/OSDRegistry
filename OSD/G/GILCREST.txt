GILCREST SERIES

The Gilcrest series consists very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Gilcrest sandy loam - irrigated cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; neutral, clear smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

  Bt--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; thin patchy clay films on peds and on sand grains and as bridges between sand grains; approximately 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 16inches thick)

  Bk--15 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly light sandy loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; visible calcium carbonate occurs as concretions and as coatings on gravel fragments; 20 percent gravel; clay bridging and coatings on sand grains; calcareous moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

  2Ck--22 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand and gravel, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose; weak to moderate accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate principally as coatings on the underside of pebbles in the upper part of horizon; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Morgan County, Colorado; 2,600 feet south and 700 feet west of the NE corner of Sec. 12, T. 4 N., R. 59 W.

Rock fragments: 15 to 30 percent. 
Size: gravel 

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR 
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist,
Chroma: 1.5 through 3

COMPETING SERIES:
Current competitor series are the Betonnie, Bijou, Terro, Terry, Tintero, and Vonalee series.
Betonnie and Tintero soils typically have redder hues.
Bijou soils are noncalcareous throughout.
Bijou, Terry and Vonalee soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments.
Terro and Terry soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depth of less than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: alluvium 
Landform: nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and alluvial fans.
Slope: 0 to 6 percent 
Mean annual temperature: 53 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 inches 
Precipitation pattern: 8 to 9 inches of which falls during the months of April through August.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Glenberg, Haverson and Vona soils and the competing Bijou soils.
Glenberg and Haverson soils lack an argillic horizon.
Vona soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well to somewhat excessively drained
Runoff: low
Permeability: rapid

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used as irrigated and dry cropland, and as native pastureland.  Native vegetation is mainly blue grama, needle grass, and some cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent.
