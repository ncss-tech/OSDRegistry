GRANTCENTER SERIES

The Grantcenter series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on old stream meanders and natural levees on flood plains. These soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 675 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A, AB, Bg1, and Bg2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (A, AB, Bg1, Bg2, BCg, and Cg horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 58 centimeters (Ap, A, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 58 to 142 centimeters (Bg and BCg horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
