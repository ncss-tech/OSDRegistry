GINEX SERIES

The Ginex series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on side slopes of hills. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ginex very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with about 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

    A--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Btk1--5 to 10 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; common thin clay films bridging sand grains; 30 percent gravel; common thin carbonate coats on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    Btk2--10 to 18 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; common thin clay films bridging sand grains; 45 percent gravel; common thin carbonate coats on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Cr--18 cm; highly fractured, moderately weathered shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 28 miles south of Battle Mountain, about 2,500 feet east and 2,100 feet north of the projected southwest corner of section 1, T. 25 N., R. 43 E.; USGS The Cedars 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 1 minute 22 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 4 minutes 58 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.0638889 latitude, -117.0850000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring, dry from early June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 13 to 36 cm.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, increasing with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  18 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent when mixed, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Effervescence:  Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.

Btk horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 through 6.
Texture:  Very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam.
Effervescence:  Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.
Carbonates:  Thin coats on undersides of gravel or fine filaments and threads.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alcan, Armoine, Berit, Bouncer, Entero, Flex, Penelas, Ravenell, Stodick, and Zyzzi series.  

Alcan and Entero soils have a noneffervescent control section and mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 15 degrees C.  Armoine and Stodick soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 36 to 50 cm.  Also, Armoine soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 14 degrees C and Stodick soils have a noneffervescent Bt horizon.  Berit soils have a neutral or slightly acid control section with 50 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Bouncer soils have a neutral control section.  Flex, Ravenell, and Zyzzi soils have noneffervescent Bt horizon.  Also, Ravenell also have a Bt horizons with 35 to 45 percent clay and Zyzzi soils have a Bt horizon with 50 to 75 percent gravel.  Penelas soils have 60 to 75 percent thin flat rock fragments throughout the soil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ginex soils are on side slopes of hills.  These soils formed in residuum from sedimentary rock that is influenced by calcareous dust.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,710 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.; and frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Burrita series.  Burrita soils have a clayey-skeletal argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Utah juniper, Wyoming big sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24.
