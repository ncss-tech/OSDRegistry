GUISER SERIES

The Guiser series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from quartzite and conglomerate. Guiser soils are on mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Guiser extremely cobbly loam--forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 Oe--0 to 3 cm; black (10YR 2/1) moist; partly decomposed needles and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick) 

 A1--3 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (17 to 35 cm thick) 

 A2--20 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 60 cm thick) 

 Bt--41 to 94 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on face of peds; 35 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (38 to 76 cm thick) 

 C--94 to 155 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 75 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Badgercamp, Bakscratch, Boneyard, Chamberlain, Cowlow, Crandal, Forsey, Fourme, Hiridge, Itow, Jackflat, Packer, Scuffe, Stopatoe, Successloop, Tagum, Toquima, Winada, and Zeebar series. 
Badgercamp, Bakscratch, and Highridge soils are shallow. 
Boneyard, Cowlow, Itwo, Scuffe, Stopatoe, Tagum, Toquima, Winda soils are moderately deep.
Chamberlain soils formed in alluvium that averages less than 60 percent rock fragments and the rock fragments are rounded. 
Forsey and Packer soils have an argillic horizon with a lower boundary less than 70 cm. 
Fourme, Crandal, and Zeebar soils have mean annual soil temperature that averages less than 6 degrees.
Jackflat soils average less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and a reaction that ranges to slightly acid. 
Successloop soils average 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Guiser soils are on mountains. These soils formed in colluvium from quartzite and conglomerate. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 2,350 to 3,350 meters. The climate is cold and moist during the winter and early spring months and cool and dry during the summer months. Mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is 500 to 610 mm, in most years the snow pack melts by mid-June. The frost-free period is 50 to 75 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hackwood and Hardzem series. Hackwood soils have thick mollic epipedons and lack argillic horizons. Hardzem soils are moderately deep. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is white fir, limber pine, some bristlecone pine, and curlleaf mountain mahogany. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountains in Eastern Nevada. Guiser soils are of moderate extent. MLRA 28B
