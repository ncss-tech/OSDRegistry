GLADEL SERIES

The Gladel series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and eolian material derived from sandstone.  Gladel soils are on mesas and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Gladel flaggy fine sandy loam.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) flaggy fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; 10 percent channers and 10 percent flagstones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bw--5 to 10 inches, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) flaggy fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; 15 percent channers and 15 percent flagstones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bk--10 to 15 inches, pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) flaggy fine sandy loam, pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; 15 percent channers and 15 percent flagstones; common fine irregular carbonate threads and coatings on rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick) 

    R--15 inches, hard reddish brown sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: residuum and eolian material derived from sandstone
Landform: mesas and hills
Slopes: 1 to 50 percent
Elevation: 5,800 to 7,400 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 46 to 50 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer. 
Frost-free period: 100 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pulpit and Wetherill series.  Pulpit soils are moderately deep and have an argillic horizon.  Wetherill soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, negligible to high runoff, moderately rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as grazing land.  Native vegetation is mainly pinyon, juniper, sage, western wheatgrass, cactus, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado and southeast Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dolores county, (San Miguel Area). Colorado.

REMARKS: Reclassification due to changes in the moisture regime as a result of the Four Corners Climate Conference of 10/92  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from 0 to 5 inches.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon: from 0 to 10 inches. (Bw horizon) This zone shows evidence of the removal of carbonates and has higher chroma than the underlying horizon.
Lithic contact: at 15 inches.  (R layer)
Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 15 inches. (Bk)
