GRANDMORE SERIES


The Grandmore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devol, Grandfield, Headrick, McKnight, and Ozark series.

Devol series: Occur on higher ridges and have a course-loamy textural control section.
Grandfield and McKnight series: Occur on slightly higher broad convex areas.
Headrick series: Occur on slightly lower broad flat to concave areas and have a perched water table within 40 inches of the surface.
Ozark series: Occur on similar areas but have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Moderately slow permeability. Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes and medium on 1 to 3
percent slopes. A perched water table is 40 to 60 inches below the surface during the months October to May of most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as cropland. Wheat, grain sorghum, cotton, alfalfa, improved bermudagrass, and weeping lovegrass are the principal
crops. Native vegetation is mid and tall grasses.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harmon County, Oklahoma, 1982 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 10 to 30 inches (Bt1 & Bt2 horizons).

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon). 

Argillic horizon: 10 to 80 inches (Bt & 2Btb horizons).

Episaturation (perched water table): Zone of saturation at 40 to 80 inches during some part of the year (Bt3 & 2Btb horizons).

Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Btb horizon.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred by laboratory data from similar associated soils from Jackson County, Oklahoma.
