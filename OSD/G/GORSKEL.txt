 A--0 to 13 cm; very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; 5 percent stones, 30 percent cobbles, and 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary

 Bt1--13 to 20 cm; gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 25 percent gravel; few faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary

 Bt2--20 to 33 cm; very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary

 2Bkqm--33 cm; indurated, silica-cemented duripan
