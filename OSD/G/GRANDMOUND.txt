11/2016--The Grandmound series was established as part of an update project. The official series description was developed according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation and laboratory sampling of the glacially modified river valleys and outwash plains in MLRA 2 is recommended to determine distribution.
