GOLDPEAK SERIES

The Goldpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in granitic alluvium. Goldpeak soils are on fan remnants, pediments and footslopes of hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dovecanyon (CA), Goldivide (CA), Helendale (CA), Searchlight (NV), Sonoita (AZ), Tray (CA), and Wingap (CA) series. Dovecanyon soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 18 to 22 degrees C. Goldivide, Helendale, and Searchlight soils receive summer precipitation and are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms. Searchlight soils are also calcareous throughout. Sonoita soils receive more rainfall and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the moisture control section between July and October. Tray soils are calcareous throughout and have strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline argillic horizons with exchangeable sodium percentages (ESP) of 15 to 30 percent. Wingap soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 centimeters. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Goldpeak soils are on fan remnants, pediments and footslopes of hills.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in granitic alluvium. Elevations range from 1,130 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 230 millimeters, mostly in the form of winter precipitation.  The mean annual air temperature is 13 to 16 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 165 to 220 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Birdcanyon , Dovecanyon , Pinyonpeak and Wingap  soils.  Birdcanyon soils occur on fan aprons and are sandy throughout. Dovecanyon soils occur on fan remnants at lower elevations and have a mean annual soil temperature between 18.1 to 22 degrees C. Pinyonpeak soils occur on hills and are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Wingap soils occur on the lower part of hills and are deep to a paralithic contact. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low runoff on the gentle slopes and medium on the steep slopes; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, spiny hopsage, Sandberg bluegrass, Nevada ephedra, and horsebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Mojave Desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 29. The soils are of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kern County, California, 2007; Jawbone-Butterbredt Off-Highway Vehicle Area, part of the Mojave Desert Area, Northwest Part, California. The name is coined from Gold Peak which is located within the soil survey boundary.
