GOLDVALE SERIES

The Goldvale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvial fan sediments derived from reddish brown arkosic sandstone and interbedded sandstone and shale. Goldvale soils are on side slopes of alluvial valleys, mountains, hogbacks and homoclinal ridges. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:Goldvale stony coarse sandy loam - woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; undecomposed organic material, chiefly needles, bark and twigs.

    Oe--5 inches to 10 cm; partially decomposed organic material like that of the overlying horizon.

    A--10 to 15 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stony coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine crumb structure; soft, very friable; 20 percent reddish brown arkosic flagstone; many medium and coarse angular granite sand; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

    E--15 to 71 cm; pink (5YR 8/3) stony coarse sandy loam, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocks and then to fine granules; slightly hard, very friable; vesicular; 20 percent reddish brown flagstones; many medium and coarse angular granite sand; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

    E/B--71 to 86 cm; mixed colors including pink (5YR 8/3) and reddish brown (5YR 5/4) stony light sandy clay loam; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) moist and reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very friable, slightly plastic; horizon consists of nodules and seams of clayey material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a lighter colored matrix like that of the overlying horizon; 20 percent reddish brown arkose flagstones; many medium and coarse angular granite sand; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt--86 to 137 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) stony coarse sandy clay, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, very sticky, plastic; thick continuous clay films on peds and as coatings and fillings inside root channels and pores; 20 percent reddish brown arkose flagstones; many medium and coarse angular granite sand; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (50 to 100 cm thick)

    BC--137 to 175 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) stony sandy clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, slightly plastic; thin patchy clay films on peds and as linings inside some root channels; 25 percent reddish brown arkose flagstones; many medium and coarse angular granite sand; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    C--175 to 200 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) stony coarse sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, very friable, 25 percent reddish brown flagstones; many medium and coarse angular granite sand; slightly acid.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:Boulder Area, Colorado, 1971.

REMARKS:Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Albic horizon--15 to 71 cm (E horizon)
Argillic horizon--86 to 137 cm (Bt horizon)
These soils have transitional E/B or B/E horizons--71 to 86 cm (E/B horizon)
