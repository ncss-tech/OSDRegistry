GILLINGHAM SERIES

The Gillingham series consists of well drained soils deep to sandstone bedrock.  These upland soils formed in eolian sands, loamy slope alluvium, and in loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone.  These soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  Permeability is rapid in the eolian sand, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy slope alluvium and in the loamy residuum, and slow to moderate in the sandstone.  Slope ranges from 6 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Arenic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Gillingham loamy fine sand, on a convex, west-facing slope of 11 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 790 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw1--8 to 20 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy fine sand; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--20 to 29 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) loamy fine sand; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and many fine roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

    2Bt1--29 to 42 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    3Bt2--42 to 50 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) fine sandy loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common faint olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 5 percent glauconitic channers; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    3Cr--50 to 80 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) and dark greenish gray (5G 4/1) weakly cemented fine-grained glauconitic sandstone; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Richland County, Wisconsin; about 5 miles southwest of Richland Center; about 1,650 feet east and 900 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 10, T. 9 N., R. 1 W.; USGS Richland Center topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 15 minutes 55 seconds N. and long. 90 degrees 28 minutes 57 seconds W., NAD 27.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Delton, Okee, Puchyan, Rohrbeck, and Seward series.  The Delton, Okee, Puchyan, Rohrbeck, and Seward soils do not have a paralithic contact within the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian sand, loamy slope alluvium, and in loamy residuum from the underlying fine-grained glauconitic sandstone
Landform: hills in bedrock controlled uplands
Geologic formation: typically the Tunnel City sandstone that is identified, in part by it's high content of glauconitic minerals
Elevation: 780 to 840 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 48 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 30 to 34 inches
Frost-free period: 135 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Urne and Windward soils near the type location.  The Urne soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  The Urne soils do not have sandy textures in upper part of the solum.  The Windward soils are lower on the landscape.  The Windward soils do not have a paralithic contact with bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Permeability: Rapid in the eolian sands, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy slope alluvium and in the loamy residuum, and slow to moderate in the sandstone
Runoff: Very low to low

USE AND VEGETATION: The less sloping areas are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay.  The higher sloping areas are used for pastureland and woodland.  Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Wisconsin.  MLRA 105.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-10 (La Crosse, Wisconsin).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richland County, Wisconsin, 2002.  Name comes from an
unincorporated town in Richland County.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap); 
Cambic horizon--the zone from 8 to 29 inches Bw1, Bw2); 
Argillic horizon--the zone from 29 to 50 inches (2Bt, 3Bt); 
Paralithic contact--50 inches (3Cr).

These soils were originally mapped as Hixton in Richland County, Wisconsin with sand spots in many of the map units.  The Gillingham soils are located on the hills on the east sides of larger valleys.
