GERMANGULCH SERIES

The Germangulch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks mixed with volcanic ash in the surface.  These soils are on mountains, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Germangulch cobbly ashy sandy loam, in rangeland on a 52 percent slope at 1,951 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter.	

    E--3 to 23 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine interstitial and irregular pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt--23 to 58 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; friable, hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 50 cm thick)

    BC--58 to 84 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 45 cm thick) 

    Cr--84 cm; weakly cemented tuffaceous rhyolite.
