GEROW SERIES

The Gerow series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic ash, basalt, rhyolite and tuffs. Gerow soils are in wet meadows, swales, drainageways and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquandic Cryaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Gerow ashy silty clay loam - wet meadow, on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of about 5,200 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise specified.) 

  A1--0 to 6 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong medium and coarse platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine to medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick) 

  A2--6 to 10 inches, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) ashy silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium and coarse platy structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine through medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

  A3--10 to 15 inches, black (10YR 2/1) ashy silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium prismatic parting to strong medium platy structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine through medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct brown coatings on ped faces and lining pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick) 

  A4--15 to 25 inches, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) ashy silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium platy structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine through medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct brown coatings on ped faces and lining pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

  2A5--25 to 36 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

  2Bw--36 to 60 inches, brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2)
