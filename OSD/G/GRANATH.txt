GRANATH SERIES

The Granath series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Granath soils are on mesas, hills, and stable alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackdog, Farland, Morton, and Xavier series.
Soils that may be competitors when the classification is updated are the:  Dingle and Hanaker series.

Blackdog, Farland, Hanaker, and Xavier:  have hues of 10YR or yellower in all horizons.
Morton:  have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.
Dingle: are calcareous throughout and formed in stratified lacustrine deposits.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  eolian deposits derived from sandstone
Landform: mesas, hills, and stable alluvial fans
Slopes:  0 to 15 percent
Elevation: 7,100 to 8,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  43 to 47 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 22 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period:  80 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ilex and Ricot soils.  Ilex soils have more than 35 percent clay in their argillic horizons and lack mollic epipedons.  Ricot soils have more than 35 percent clay in their argillic horizon and have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the profile. Both are on similar landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to very high runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  They are used as grazing land or for dry and irrigated cropland.  Native vegetation is mainly oakbrush and scattered ponderosa pine with an understory of native bluegrass and needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.
