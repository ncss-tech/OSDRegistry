GYPTUR SERIES

The Gyptur series consists of deep and very deep, well drained saline-sodic soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from siltstone and shale.  Gyptur soils are on toeslopes of undulating plateaus and on dissected fan terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Leptic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Gyptur very fine sandy loam--on an east facing toeslope of 1 percent at 5,190 feet elevation--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described, the pedon was dry throughout.)

   A--0 to 2 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong very thick platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine vesicular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

   2AB--2 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to strong very fine granular; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine vesicular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

   3By--5 to 17 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gypsiferous loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; secondary silt-sized gypsum crystals segregated in common fine irregularly shaped filaments on faces of peds, few coarse sand-sized primary gypsum crystals; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary.  (9 to 16 inches thick)

   3BCy--17 to 26 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gypsiferous loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; few very fine random tubular pores; secondary silt sized gypsum crystals segregated in few fine irregularly shaped filaments, few coarse sand-sized primary gypsum crystals throughout; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

   3C--26 to 46 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gypsiferous loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive, platy rock structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine irregularly shaped pores; 5 percent soft siltstone fragments; few coarse sand-sized primary gypsum crystals; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 27 inches thick)

   3Cr--46 inches; soft siltstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gyptur soils are on toeslopes of undulating plateaus and on dissected fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from thinly interbedded Cretaceous siltstone and shale.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 5,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 percent inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fordbutte (T), Littlehat (T), Nataani (T), Persayo and Ravola soils.  Fordbutte and Littlehat soils are moderately deep and lack gypsic horizons.  Nataani soils are coarse-silty and moderately deep.  Persayo soils are shallow.  Ravola soils are stratified, lack diagnostic horizons, and are on floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Gyptur soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is mat, mound and sickle saltbushes, Castle Valley clover, shadscale, alkali sacaton, Indian ricegrass, prickly pear cactus and halogeton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gyptur soils are of small extent on the Four Corners Platform portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and possibly southwest Colorado.  LRR-D; MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Shiprock Area, Parts of San Juan County, New Mexico and Apache County, Arizona; 1993.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches.  (A horizon)

Gypsic horizon - The zone from 5 to about 17 inches.  (3Bky horizon)

Paralithic contact - The presence of soft sedimentary bedrock at about 46 inches.  (3Cr horizon)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  SAR values are bracketed around one pedon for which data is available.  Salinity values were determined on five pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge or an Instant EC kit.  Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with a field volume calcimeter.
