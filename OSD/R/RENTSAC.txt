RENTSAC SERIES

The Rentsac series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sandstone and limestone.  These soils are on mountains, escarpments, bedrock-floored plains, fan remnants, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rentsac channery loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many medium and fine roots; 15 percent sandstone channers; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--2 to 7 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) channery loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 30 percent sandstone channers; disseminated lime; continuous distinct lime casts coating channers; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk2--7 to 18 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) extremely channery loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and fine roots; many fine and very fine pores and few medium pores; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent channers, 20 percent flagstones; disseminated lime; continuous distinct lime casts coating channers; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    R--18+ inches; calcareous sandstone.
