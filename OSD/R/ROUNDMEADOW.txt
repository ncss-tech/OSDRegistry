ROUNDMEADOW SERIES

The Roundmeadow series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on mountain backslopes. Roundmeadow soils formed in a thin volcanic ash mantle over colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and mean annual temperature about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Andic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Roundmeadow ashy silt loam--forested, on a 40 percent northfacing slope at an elevation of 5,010 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  Soil textures are apparent field textures.)

 Oi--0 to 1.5 inches; slightly decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves

 Oe--1.5 to 2 inches; moderately decomposed organic matter

 A--2 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; common fine roots; few fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 8 inches thick)

 Bw--3 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick)

 2Eb--14 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and coarse, and many medium roots; common fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

 2Bwb--23 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary. (9 to 16 inches thick)
