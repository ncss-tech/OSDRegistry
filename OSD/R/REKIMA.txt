REKIMA SERIES

The Rekima series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils on basalt plains and buttes. They formed in thin eolian and alluvial deposits. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rekima very stony fine sandy loam on a 3 percent southwest facing slope at 3,350 feet elevation in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw1--3 to 6 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw2--6 to 15 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine  and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

    2Bkq--15 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots as mats on lime and silica coated basalt fragments; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--18 to 19 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) indurated duripan, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 25mm thick)

    3R--19 inches; lime and silica coated basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boger (T), Gravden, Gunnel, Jericho, Karpp and Lein series. Boger soils have duripans 3 to 15 inches thick.  Gravden, Gunnel, Jericko, Karpp and Lein soils are all greater than 20 inches to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rekima soils are on basalt plains and buttes, at elevations of 3,200 to 4,700 feet.  The soils formed in thin eolian and alluvial deposits.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  The climate is semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches, average annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ackley, Deerhorn, Wako(t), Wendell(t), and Wildors soils. All of these soils are greater than 20 inches to duripan or bedrock. Ackley an Wendell soils occur on the same landscape. Deerhorn and Wildors soils occur on buttes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for rangeland.  Some minor areas are irrigated and used for pasture. Potential vegetation in the natural plant community is Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Idaho.  The series is of small extent.
