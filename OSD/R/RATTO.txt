RATTO SERIES

The Ratto series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic rocks.  Ratto soils are on lava plateaus and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Actem series.  Actem soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 76 cm from the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ratto soils are on lava plateaus and fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks in Oregon and in alluvium derived from mixed rocks strongly influenced by the Newark Canyon Formation in Nevada.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,780 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm that comes primarily as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coglin and McConnel soils.  Coglin soils are very deep and do not have duripans.  McConnel soils are sandy-skeletal, very deep, and have cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ratto soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.  Scattered Utah juniper grows on these soils in central Nevada.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon and central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The original series concept is in MLRA 28B in Nevada, while the main acreage and new type location occurs in MLRA 23 in Oregon.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Eureka County (Diamond Valley Area), Nevada, 1971.

REMARKS:  This revision of March 2004 updates the taxonomic class from Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Haploxeralfic Argidurids based on use of the series in Oregon.  The type location is moved to a more representative area in Lake County, Oregon.  Future study is needed of the Ratto soils as mapped in Eureka County, Nevada to determine both the degree of cementation in the duripan and whether the typical depth class is actually moderately deep instead of shallow. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A and AB horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 33 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 33 to 152 cm (Bk, 2Bkqm, and 2Bk horizons).
Duripan - The zone from 38 to 48 cm (2Bkqm horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 33 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
