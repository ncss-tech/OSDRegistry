RICHFIELD SERIES

The Richfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loess. Richfield soils are on tableland plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 46 centimeters (18 inches) and mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Richfield silt loam, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary. Horizon thickness ranges from 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches). 

  Bt--15 to 41 centimeters (6 to 16 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; sticky and plastic; common fine faint clay films; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. Horizon thickness ranges from 20 to 36 centimeters (8 to 14 inches).

  BCk1--41 to 51 centimeters (16 to 20 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few soft accumulations of carbonate; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

  BCk2--51 to 76 centimeters (20 to 30 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak granular structure; slightly hard, friable; few soft accumulations of carbonate; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. Combined thickness for BCk horizons ranges from 46 to 127 centimeters (18 to 50 inches). 

  C--76 to 152 centimeters (30 to 60 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; porous; strong effervescence; strongly alkaline.

This horizon is usually calcareous loess, but in some pedons when the loess mantle is thin, contrasting material is between depths of 102 and 152 centimeters (40 and 60 inches). In some pedons the substratum contains buried horizons.

Mean annual air temperature: 7 to 14 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 33 to 56 centimeters (13 to 22 inches)
Precipitation pattern: peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months
Frost-free period: 140 to 201 days.
Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index: 24 to 34 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Keith, Satanta, Colby, Ulysses, Goshen, Ryus, and Ness, soils. Keith soils are fine-silty and are on similar positions. Satanta soils are fine-loamy and are on similar positions. The Colby soils are fine-silty and occupy steeper slope positions. Ulysses soils are fine-silty and are on upland hillslopes. Goshen soils have a thicker mollic epipedon and are on lower positions. Ryus soils are on lower positions. Ness soils are more clayey and are in upland depressions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high
Runoff: low or medium 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Richfield soils are cultivated to winter wheat and sorghum. Native vegetation is mainly short and mid grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Kansas and Nebraska, eastern Colorado, southwestern South Dakota and the Oklahoma Panhandle. The series is of large extent.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: the zone from the surface to 41 centimeters (16 inches) (A and Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon: the zone from 15 to 41 centimeters (6 to 16 inches) (Bt horizon)
Three sets of lab data support a borderline fine and fine-silty family, but range of characteristics presents a fine family soil.
