RALTON SERIES

The Ralton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on valley flood plains and have slopes that range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 43 centimeters (17 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ralton loam with a slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

Duroc soils are well drained, fine-silty and above Ralton soils on the landscape.
Chappell soils are well drained, coarse-loamy and above Ralton soils on the landscape.
Bayard soils are well drained and above Ralton soils on the landscape.
