RATIOPEAK SERIES 

The Ratiopeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from fine grained sandstone or fine grained igneous rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, hills, mountain slopes, ridges and landslides. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

Slope - 0 to 50 percent
Parent material - alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from fine grained sandstone or fine grained igneous rock 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 40 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cheadle and Tiban soils. Cheadle soils are shallow, do not have an argillic horizon and are on more convex postions. Tiban soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on similar landform positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Ratiopeak soils are primarily used for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Columbia needlegrass, rough fescue, yarrow, lupine, mountain big sagebrush, and stoneseed.  Some areas have widely spaced Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ratiopeak soils are of moderate extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B and 46.
