RADERSBURG SERIES

The Radersburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan remnants, and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Radersburg very cobbly loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots and pores; 55 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt--10 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots and pores; common distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 40 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 38 cm thick)

    Bk--38 to 76 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common distinct calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 45 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 51 cm thick)

    C--76 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) cobbly loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 55 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
