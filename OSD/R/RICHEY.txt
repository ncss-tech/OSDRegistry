RICHEY SERIES

The Richey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Richey silty clay loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic staining on faces of peds; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine and few medium roots; many fine and few medium pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--13 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; few fine threads and masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk2--20 to 29 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; common fine soft masses of segregated lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Byz1--29 to 46 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; common masses of gypsum and other salts; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 18 inches thick)

    Byz2--46 to 68 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam with thin strata of silt loam and loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine pores;  few fine threads and masses of gypsum and other salts; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fergus County, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Records:  MT0355 and MT0701.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon; a cambic horizon from 7 to 13 inches (Bw horizon); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation from 13 to 29 inches (Bk horizons); horizons of gypsum and salt accumulation from 29 to 68 inches (Byz horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2, Byz1 horizons).  Richey soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
