REDONA SERIES

The Redona series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in moderately fine textured calcareous alluvium derived from red siltstone, shale, and sandstone of Triassic age.  These soils are on hillslopes, alluvial fan terraces, and valley side slopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Redona fine sandy loam, on northeast facing, side slope, 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 1,170 m (3,850 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: An aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 205 days to 270 days, cumulative, in normal years.  The soil is intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section May through October.  The soil is driest November through April.  July and August are the months when the soil is moist for the longest periods.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amarose (NM), Grizzle (AZ), Gulch (AZ), Headquarters (NM), McAllister (AZ), McNeal (AZ), and Tinney (NM) series.

Amarose soils: have an argillic horizon that extends to 200 cm or more.
Headquarters soils: have a calcic horizon at 25 to 50 cm.
McAllister, McNeal, Grizzle, and Gulch soils:  are intermittently moist in the soil moisture control section between July to September and December to February.  These soils also support a distinctively different vegetative community characteristic of the Sonoran Desert environment.
Tinney soils: are calcareous to the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in moderately fine textured calcareous alluvium derived from red siltstone, shale and sandstone from the Triassic period.
Landform: on slightly convex alluvial fans, terraces, and valley slopes.
Slope: 0 to 5 percent.
Mean annual temperature: 15 to 21 degrees C (58 to 70 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 406 mm (12 to 16 in).
Frost-free period: 180 to 220 days. 
Elevation: 1,100 to 1,620 meters (3,600 to 5,300 ft).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ima, La Lande, Montoya, and Tucumcari series.
Ima and La Lande series: do not have an argillic or calcic horizon. 
Montoya and Tucumcari series: are fine textured in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Moderate permeability.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for livestock grazing and irrigated crop production.  Irrigated crops are alfalfa, cotton, feed grains, and broom corn.  Native vegetation is principally blue grama, sideoats grama, buffalograss, tobosa, yucca, mesquite, and cholla cactus.  This series has been correlated to the Sandy Plains (R070XB055NM), Sandy Loam (R070XB054NM) and Loamy (R070XB052NM) range sites in MLRA-70.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Upper Pecos River Valley (MLRA 70B in LRR G) of east-central New Mexico and western Texas).  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Quay County (Tucumcari Area), New Mexico, 1969.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm.  (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: 25 to 71 cm.  (Bt horizon)
Calcic horizon: 71 to 200 cm.  (Bk horizon)
Additional comments: Where the upper horizon meets the color requirements of a mollic epipedon, it is either too thin or does not have sufficient organic carbon.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data from Quay County, NM (S91NM-037-010, S91NM-037-006, S91NM-037-005), Guadalupe County, NM (S91NM-019-002), and San Miguel County, NM (S91NM-047-002).
