RUPS SERIES

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar soils are the Asher, Ashport, Retrop, and Spur series.
Asher and Ashport series: These soils are well drained, nonsaline, and in a moister climate.
Retrop series: Have an ochric epipedon, nonsaline, and do not have a cambic horizon. 
Spur series: Well drained, nonsaline, and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Recent alluvium along small creeks and streams that drain silty Pleistocene age terraces and Permian age redbed sediments in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78).
Landform: Flood plain.
Slope: 0 to 1 percent.
Mean annual temperature: 59 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 28 inches.
Frost-free period: 200 to 230 days.

Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 44. 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hollister, La Casa, Roark, Spur, Tillman, Tilvern, and Westill series. 
Hollister series: These soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick, a fine particle-size control section, and are on higher terrace positions.
La Casa, Roark, Tillman, and Westill series: These soils have an argillic horizon, a fine particle-size control section, and are on higher terrace and upland positions.
Tilvern series: These soils have a ochric epipedon, have a fine particle-size control section, and are on higher upland positions.
Spur series: These soils are on similar flood plain positions. 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Moderately slow permeability. Runoff is low. Frequently or occasionally flooded for brief or very brief periods during the months of April to October. Apparent water table is at 1.5 to 3.3 feet below the surface for at least 20 or more continious or 30 or more cummulative days during the months October to May. 
USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in rangeland, but some occasionally flooded areas have been cropped. Native vegetation is mainly alkali sacaton, inland saltgrass, and western wheatgrass. Tamarisk is a common invader. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Oklahoma and Northwestern Texas; LRR H; MLRA 78C and 78B; Extent is small. 
MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas. 
SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jackson County, OK; 2000. 
REMARKS: These soils were mapped as Spur-wet in an earlier soil survey (Series 1958) of Jackson Co., OK. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches (A2, Bkz1, and Bkz2 horizons). 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 15 inches (A1 and A2 horizons). 
Cambic horizon: 15 to 48 inches (Bkz1 and Bkz2 horizons). 
Redoximorphic depletions: 15 to 30 inches (Bkz1 horizon). 
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation at 24 to 60 inches (Bkz1, Bkz2, and Ckz horizons). 
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils.
