REDMORE SERIES

The Redmore series consists of deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils on hills on plateaus.  They formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Alturas series.  Alturas soils are very deep and have redoximorphic concentrations below a depth of 30 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redmore soils are on hills on basalt plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Elevation ranges from 2,450 to 2,800 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches, average annual temperature is 49 to 50 degrees F., and the frost free period is 130 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Broadax, Bryden, and Nez  Perce series.  Broadax soils are on north- and east-facing hillsides and  are very deep and do not have a natric horizon.  Bryden soils are on  similar landform positions at lower elevations, and are moderately deep  to a duripan.  Nez Perce soils are on similar landform positions at  higher elevations, and are very deep and have an albic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for cropland, mainly for wheat, barley, and peas.  Native vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  This soil is of small extent.
