RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is moist intermittently May through August, dry December through February; Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 48 to 54 degrees F
Mean summer soil temperature: 68 to 73 degrees F
Depth to paralithic contact: 20 to 40 inches to shale
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 0 to 3 inches
Gypsum content: ranges from 0 to 30 percent with major concentrations confined to the horizon above and including the paralithic contact.  The gypsum is not pedogenic, but inherited from the residuum shale bedrock.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 30 percent.  CCE generally is high in the surface horizon and decreases with depth primarily due to the alluvial nature of the soil.
Thickness of the cambic horizon: 18 to 27 inches
Vertic features: Cracks extend from the shale bedrock to the surface horizon.  Cracks range from 1 to 5 mm in width. Linear extensibility ranges from 4 to 6 cm. Wedge shaped aggregates and slickensides are present.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is from the Rito Azul drainage.

REMARKS: The soil was formerly included in the Litle series.  Litle soils have a soil moisture control section that is dry for longer periods of time and occur in an aridic moisture regime. Evaluation of laboratory data and field data supports the classification of Aridic Haplusterts.  Calcium carbonate in the solum decreases with depth and is considered primary, not secondary.  Gypsum in the BCk/Cr is primary to the shale parent paterial.  Smectitic mineralogy based on field observations during September, 2002 Progress Field Review.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: 10 to 36 inches.
Particle-size control section: 10 to 36 inches.  (lower part of the Bss1 and the Bss2, BCk and BCk/Cr horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon: 3 to 29 inches.  (Bss1 and Bss2 horizons)
Paralithic contact: Shale bedrock at 36 inches.  (Cr horizon)
Vertic features: The presence of wedge shaped aggregates and slikensides from 3 to 29 inches (Bss1, Bss2, and BCk horizons)
Other features: Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
