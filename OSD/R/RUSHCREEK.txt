RUSHCREEK SERIES

The Rushcreek series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils on high flood plains.  They formed in 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loamy alluvium deposited over gravelly coarse sands.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Fluventic Haplustolls

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: nearly level and are on high flood plains  
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Parent material: 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loamy alluvium deposited over gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand or coarse sand
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. (47 to 53 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Bayard, Jankosh, Lewellen and Scoville soils.  
Bayard soils are coarse loamy and are higher on the landscape.  
Jankosh and Lewellen soils are strongly alkaline and are lower on the landscape.  
Scoville soils are sandy and higher on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: moderately well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:     Moderately
Water table: 0.9 to 1.8 meters (3 to 6 feet)  
Flooding: rare

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for cropland and are mostly under gravity irrigation.  
Corn and alfalfa are the principal crops.  
Native vegetation is dominated by alkali sacation, inland saltgrass, blue grama and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Of small extent in western Nebraska.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Garden County, Nebraska, 1994.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches) (Ap and A horizons) 
Cambic horizon: 28 to 86 centimeters (11 to 34 inches) (the Bw horizon) 
Organic carbon: irregular decrease 25 to 127 centimeters (10 to 50 inches)

In cultivated areas irrigation has caused the A horizon to be more leached of carbonates and other salts than in areas that remain in native grass. These soils were previously mapped with McCook, saline-alkali.

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
