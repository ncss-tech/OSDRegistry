SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Nacogdoches County, Texas, 1976, Nacogdoches county soil survey area, Texas, 1976. 

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Leefield series.  The series was separated based on cation exchange activity class.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 74 to 124 in.  (29 to 49 horizon) 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 74 cm (0 to 29 in).  (A and E horizons) 

Argillic horizon: 74 to 191 cm (29 to 75 in).  (Bt and Btv horizons)

Redoximorphic concentrations: 53 to 195 cm (21 to 75 in).  (E2, Bt, Btv horizons)
Redoximorphic depletions: 53 to 195 cm (21 to 75 in).  (E2, Bt, Btv horizons)
Episaturation:  The zone of saturation at 53 to 104 cm (21 to 41 in).  (E2 and Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions: 53 to 104 cm (21 to 41 in)
Other features: plinthite 5 percent or more 104 to 191 cm (41 to 75 in)

Additional Comments: 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from S86TX-423-005 from Smith County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis tests were performed at the project office on 2 pedons.  Base saturation tests were performed at the project office on 10 pedons.
