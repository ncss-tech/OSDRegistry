MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina, 2003. 

REMARKS: Redbrush soils were previously mapped with the Zion series. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Redbrush series as a mesic counterpart. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 8 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 25 inches (Bt and C/Bt horizons)
Paralithic contact--bedrock contact at a depth of 25 inches (top of the Cr horizon)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 25 to 37 inches (Cr horizon) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Presence of hard bedrock--bedrock contact at 37 inches (R horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 35 inches
