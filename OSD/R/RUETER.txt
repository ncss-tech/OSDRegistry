RUETER SERIES 

The Rueter series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from cherty limestone on steep side slopes and narrow ridgetops.   Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, mesic Typic Paleudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Rueter very gravelly silt loam, on a 22 percent southeast facing slope in a hardwood forest at an elevation of 1,190 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed leaves, roots and twigs. (0 to 2 inches thick)

 A--1 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly silt loam; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium, and common coarse roots; 45 percent chert gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

 E--6 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly silt loam; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; friable; many fine and medium, and common coarse roots; 40 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 22 inches thick)

 Bt1--14 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many medium and few coarse roots; very few faint clay films on the faces of peds; 20 percent chert cobbles and 25 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Bt2--23 to 35 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) extremely gravelly silt loam; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium and common fine roots; few faint clay films on the faces of peds; 65 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt3--35 to 43 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) extremely gravelly silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint clay films on the faces of peds; 70 percent chert gravel; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 15 to 50 inches)

 2Bt4--43 to 54 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) very gravelly clay; moderate very fine and fine angular blocky structure; very firm; common distinct clay films on the faces of peds; 55 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 2Bt5--54 to 72 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) and red (2.5YR 5/6) very gravelly clay; moderate fine angular blocky structure; very firm; many distinct clay films on the faces of peds; 40 percent chert gravel; very strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hailey series.  Series in similar families are Clarksville, Coulstone, Goss, and Noark.  Clarksville and Coustone soils are ultisols. Goss and Noark soils are clayey-skeletal. In addition, Noark soils are ultisols.  Hailey soils do not have an argillic horizon within 40 inches of the surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rueter soils are on steep side slopes and narrow ridgetops.  Slope gradients range from 3 to 70 percent, but are dominantly 15 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from cherty limestone or interbedded sandstone and cherty dolomite.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Clarksville and Noark soils, and the Hailey and Scholten soils.  Clarksville soils have less than 35 percent base saturation and are on ridgetops and similar side slopes.  Noark soils are clayey-skeletal, have less than 35 percent base saturation, and are on ridgetops and similar side slopes.  Hailey soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on similar positions.  Scholten soils have a fragipan and are on gently sloping ridgetops. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained.  Runoff potential is low to high.  Permeability is moderate. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the soil is in second growth timber similar to the original forest.  Some areas are used for pasture.  Native vegetation is oak/hickory forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks (MLRAs 116A and 116B) region of Missouri.  The series is of moderate extent.
