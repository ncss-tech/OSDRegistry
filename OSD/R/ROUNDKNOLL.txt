ROUNDKNOLL SERIES

The Roundknoll series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra. Roundknoll soils are on kipukas on recent basalt plains and associated with lava flows.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The permeability is rapid. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Typic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Roundknoll gravelly ashy loamy sand - on a 10 percent slope at an elevation of 5,600 feet in rangeland. When described on June 3, 1997, the soil was dry. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly ashy loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; about 15 percent cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

	A2--3 to 10 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly ashy loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; about 30 percent cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

	Bw--10 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly ashy loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium interstitial pores; about 60 percent cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

	Bk1--15 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose; few very fine roots; many very fine , fine and medium interstitial pores; about 50 percent cinders; carbonates are on the cinders and are violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

	Bk2--20 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly ashy loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose; few very fine roots; many very fine, fine and medium interstitial pores; about 60 percent cinders; carbonates are on cinders and are violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

	Bk3--30 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly ashy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose; many very fine, fine and medium interstitial pores; about 80 percent cinders; carbonates are on cinders and are violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roundknoll soils are on kipukas on recent basalt plains and associated with lava flows. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 5,800 feet. The soil formed in wind deposited volcanic tephra. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain. The mean annual air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are lava flows. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Rapid runoff. Rapid over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for wildlife. Vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, lava fernbush, snowberry, bitterbrush, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Idaho. This series is of limited extent.
