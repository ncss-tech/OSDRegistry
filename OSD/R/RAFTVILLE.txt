RAFTVILLE SERIES

The Raftville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and stream alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping strath terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Typic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Raftville silt loam  on a convex 3 percent slope in a fescue pasture at an elevation of 1,120 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 10 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine platy structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; common very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 5 percent chert gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick).

  Bt1--10 to 22 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent chert gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt smooth boundary.

  2Bt2--22 to 29 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) very gravelly loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 60 percent chert gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.1); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt and 2Bt horizons is 12 to 30 inches)

  2BC--29 to 37 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly loam; massive; loose; few fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 70 percent chert gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

  3R--37 inches; sandstone

TYPE LOCATION:  Texas County, Missouri; about 6 miles southwest of Houston; 200 feet south and 150 feet west of the northeast corner of Sec. 6, T. 29 N., R. 11 W.; Bucyrus USGS quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees, 14 minutes, 58 seconds N., longitude 92 degrees, 10 minutes, 38 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.    

The Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture is silt loam, sandy loam, or loam or their gravelly analogs.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.  Reaction is neutral to very strongly acid.

Some pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam, or their gravelly analogs.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam, or their gravelly analogues.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.  

The 2Bt and 2BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogs of sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. Rock fragments range from 15 to 80 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid.

The 3R horizon consists of layers of very hard chert and sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alonzville, Bailegap, Beersheba, Gunstock, Hambrook, Harmiller, Jefferson, Keener, Lily, Lonewood, Marr, Riney, Sassafras, Shinbone, and Sunnyside series. Alonzville, Bailegap, Beersheba, Gunstock, Hambrook, Harmiller, Keener, Jefferson, Lonewood, Marr, Riney, Sassafras, Shinbone, and Sunnyside soils do not have a lithic contact within 40 inches.  In addition, Beersheba, Gunstock, and Harmiller soils have a paralithic contact.  Lily soils have fewer rock fragments in the lower part of the profile.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Raftville soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping strath terraces.  They formed in colluvium and stream alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bender, Kaintuck, Lecoma, Racket, and Razort series, and the competing Lily series.  Bender soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments and are on ridgetops and sideslopes.  Kaintuck and Racket soils are very deep and are on floodplains.  Lecoma and Razort series are very deep and are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is low to medium.  Permeability is moderate.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.  It is subject to rare flooding on low terrace levels.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used mainly for hay and pasture.  A few areas are used for corn and small grains.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Ozarks region (MLRA 116A) of south central Missouri and possibly north Arkansas.  The series is of moderate extent.
