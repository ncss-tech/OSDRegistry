RICHOLLOW SERIES

The Richollow series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone, dolomite, calcareous siltstone or calcareous sandstone.  Richollow soils are on north and east slopes of hills, mountains and summits. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Calcicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Richollow very gravelly silt loam, extremely stony--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk--7 to 13 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely cobbly silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; many fine and medium threads and carbonate masses; violently effervescent; 30 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick)

    R--13 inches; limestone. 

TYPE LOCATION: Bear Lake County, Idaho; approximately 2.9 miles southwest  of Paris; about 2,300 feet south and 1,350 feet west of the northeast corner of section 17, T. 14 S., R. 43 E.; USGS Paris 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 42 degrees 12 minutes 23.7 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees 26 minutes 57.6 seconds west longitude, NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Soholt series.  Soholt soils have a udic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: hillslopes, mountain slopes, and summits (dominantly north and east aspects)
Elevation: 6,000 to 7,700 feet
Slope: 5 to 50 percent
Parent material: colluvium and residuum from limestone, dolomite, calcareous siltstone or calcareous sandstone
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry, summers. 
Average annual precipitation: 16 to 24 inches
Average annual temperature: 36 to 41 degrees F. 
Frost-free season: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Danburn, Grunder and Swan Flat soils.  Danburn soils are very deep and fine-loamy. Grunder soils are moderately deep over hard bedrock and are fine-loamy. Both have a surface O horizon and overstory vegetation.  Swan Flat soils are very deep and are mainly on mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Richollow soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, arrowleaf balsamroot and twisted leaf.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. These soils are of small extent. MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008. The name is coined from nearby Rich Hollow. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A horizon). 

Calcic horizon - The zone from 7 to 13 inches (Bk horizon).

Richollow soils have a cryic temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
