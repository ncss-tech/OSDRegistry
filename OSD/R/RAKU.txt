RAKU SERIES

The Raku series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Raku soils are on plains, drainageways, depressions, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Raku silt loam, on a north facing, nearly level, 1 percent slope in grass at an elevation of 5675 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common patchy distinct clay films on all faces of peds; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--11 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist and crushed; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocks; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common continuous distinct clay films on all faces of peds; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.
