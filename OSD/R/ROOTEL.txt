ROOTEL SERIES 

The Rootel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium weathered from calcareous argillite and limestone bedrock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rootel channery loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots and pores; 15 percent channers; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bk1--3 to 7 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) channery loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine roots and pores; 15 percent channers; continuous faint lime casts on underside of channers; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk2--7 to 23 inches; white (10YR 8/2) channery loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots and pores; 15 percent channers; continuous faint lime casts on undersides; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick) 

    R--23 inches; fractured hard calcareous argillite bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: 

Redrock (CO) - is very deep. 

Whitesage (UT) - is very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - bedrock-floored plains, hills, and mountains. 
Elevation - 3,500 to 5,000 feet. 
Slope - 0 to 35 percent. 
Parent material - materials weathered from calcareous argillite and limestone bedrock. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches. 
Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 90 to 125 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rootel soils are used primarily as rangeland; some areas are used for dryland crops.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, blue grama, Sandberg bluegrass, and fringed sagewort. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Rootel soils are of moderate extent in western and central Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Broadwater County, Montana, 1971. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0508.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon when mixed to 7 inches (A, Bk1 horizons); a calcic horizon from 3 to 23 inches (Bk horizons); a lithic contact at 23 inches (R horizon).  Rootel soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
