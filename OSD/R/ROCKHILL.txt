ROCKHILL SERIES

The Rockhill series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in argillite and quartzite colluvium or residuum with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Lithic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Rockhill very gravelly silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--1 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic;   common very fine and fine roots; 5 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 5 percent cobbles, 50 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 15 inches thick)

    2C--14 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; 10 percent cobbles, 65 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    R--19 inches; fractured argillite and quartzite bedrock.

Mean annual precipitation - 24 to 32 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rockhill soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine. Understory vegetation is mainly oceanspray, snowberry, mallow ninebark, pinegrass, heartleaf arnica, Saskatoon serviceberry, and other grasses, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Rockhill soils are of moderate extent in the mountains of northwestern Montana.  MLRA 43A.
