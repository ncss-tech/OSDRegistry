ROUNDOR SERIES

The Roundor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous materials derived from weakly consolidated sandy and silty sedimentary beds or in alluvium over the sedimentary beds.  These soils are on escarpments, sedimentary plains, hills and strath terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Roundor loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few medium roots; many fine vesicular pores; about 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 5 percent gravel with common distinct lime coats on undersides; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 26 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; common medium and fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 16 inches thick)

    2Bk2--26 to 31 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; stratified parting to weak medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; 10 percent soft shale fragments; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Cr--31 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) semiconsolidated shale; pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).
