RAINBOWSEND SERIES

The Rainbowsend series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Rainbowsend soils are on sideslopes of fan remnants. Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carpetflat (CA), Cheme (NV), Cherioni (AZ), Cipriano (AZ), and Tyro (AZ) series. Carpetflat soils are 18 to 36 centimeters to the upper boundary of a very strongly cemented duripan. Cheme, Cipriano, Cherioni and Tyro soils do not have a rock C horizon above the A horizon. In addition, Cheme soils have semi-consolidated gravelly sediments below the duripan and Cipriano and Cherioni soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative from July to September. In addition, Cherioni soils are formed in volcanic materials and have a lithic contact within a depth of 15 centimeters. Tyro soils are on pediments with a lithic contact between 15 and 48 centimeters and have a calcic horizon above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rainbowsend soils are on sideslopes of fan remnants. Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Elevations range from 515 to 800 meters (1,690 to 2,625 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Goldenbell and Blackeagle soils. Goldenbell soils are on flat, broad summits of fan remnants and have an argillic horizon above the duripan. Blackeagle soils are on sideslopes of nearby hills and mountains. Blackeagle soils have a diagnostic cambic horizon and are shallow to a lithic contact. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; high runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the duripan and low saturated hydraulic conductivity within the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rainbowsend soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly brittlebush, creosote bush and white ratany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California.  MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
