ROSSTON SERIES 

The Rosston series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level playa floors, and closed drainage depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 13.9 degrees C (57 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Ustic Epiaquerts  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rosston clay - on a 1 percent slope in native rangeland at approximately 658 m (2160 ft) elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil Moisture: This soil has an Aquic soil moisture regime due to ponding and episaturation. The regime of the general area where this soil occurs is an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic. 
Solum thickness: 100 to greater than 200 cm (40 to greater than 80 in)
Depth to aquic conditions and redoximorphic features: 0 to 50 cm (0 to 20 in) 
Depth to slickensides: 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in)
Depth to secondary carbonates (where present): 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in)
Depth of episaturation: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) from May to November
Vertic features: 0 to 122 cm (0 to 48 in); when dry, seasonal cracks 0.5 to 5 cm (0.2 to 2 in) wide extend through one or more horizons. Also, a layer greater than 15 cm (6 in) thick with wedge-shaped peds and/or slickensides. Gilgai micro-relief is commonly observed in undisturbed areas.

Additional comments:
  Most sites meet the qualifications of hydric soil under one or more criteria.
