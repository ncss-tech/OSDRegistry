REGCRUST SERIES

The Regcrust series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on alluvial fans and in drainageways of a lava plateau.  These soils formed in alluvium from ash and pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Lapine, Wickiup and Chocknott soils.  Lapine soils are on adjacent lava plateaus.  They formed in volcanic ash and pumice, are excessively drained and have a xeric moisture regime.  Wickiup soils are in nearby depressions.  They are poorly drained, average greater than 35 percent pumice paragravel in the particle-size control section and have common or many redox accumulations within 5 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Chocknott soils are on nearby alluvial fans, stream terraces and drainageways.  They are poorly drained and have an umbric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - moderately well drained 
Permeability - very rapid
Flooding - rare
Ponding - occasional
Water table - an apparent water table is at its uppermost limit form April to June

USE AND VEGETATION:  Regcrust soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The potential natural plant community is the lodgepole pine/kinnikinnick plant association (CLM2-11).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 6.  Series is of small extent.
