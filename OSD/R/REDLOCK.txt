REDLOCK SERIES 

The Redlock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and terraces in valleys. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.
