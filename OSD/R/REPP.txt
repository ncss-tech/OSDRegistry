REPP SERIES

The Repp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from argillite, quartzite, siltstone or limestone. These soils are on mountain slopes and hills. Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Repp very gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter.

    E1--2 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 40 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

    E2--15 to 33 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; 45 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the E horizons is 15 to 40 cm)

    Bw--33 to 64 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; few lime coatings on gravel, mainly on underside; 50 percent gravel; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 45 cm thick)

    Bk1--64 to 104 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; thin lime coatings on gravel, mainly on underside; 70 percent gravel; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 90 cm thick)

    Bk2--104 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; lime coating on gravel, mainly on underside; 65 percent gravel; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:
Lamedeer (MT) - have rock fragments that are channers and flagstones
Redfist (MT) - are moderately deep to a lithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain slopes and hills
Elevation - 880 to 1,725 meters
Slope - 0 to 80 percent
Parent material - colluvium derived from argillite, quartzite, siltstone or limestone
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 430 to 650 mm
Mean annual temperature - 3.8 to 7.2 degrees C.
Frost-free period - 70 to 105 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Repp soils are used mainly for timber production and understory grazing.  Potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, elk sedge, pinegrass, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Repp soils are of small extent in western Montana and parts of Utah.  MLRAs - 43A, 44A and 46.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 33 cm (Oi, E1, E2 horizons);
Cambic horizon - 33 to 64 inches (Bw horizon);
