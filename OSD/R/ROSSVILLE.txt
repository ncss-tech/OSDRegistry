ROSSVILLE SERIES

The Rossville series consists of very deep well drained soils. They formed in silty alluvium on flood plain-steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 91 centimeters (36 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Rossville silt loam in a cultivated field. (Colors are dry soil unless otherwise stated)

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A1--18 to 36 centimeters (7 to 14 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

 A2--36 to 53 centimeters (14 to 21 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. 

 Bw1--53 to 99 centimeters (21 to 39 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary

 Bw2--99 to 145 centimeters (39 to 57 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 46 to 91 centimeters (18 to 36 inches) thick)

 BC--145 to 203 centimeters (57 to 80 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Allison, Anthon, Huntsville, Ivan, Judson, Kahola, Kennebec, Kenridge, Lindstrom, Napier, Sturkie, and Worthen series. 
Anthon soils formed in loess or silty alluvium over sand and gravel.
The Allison, Anthon, Huntsville, Judson, Lindstrom, and Napier soils are less than 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) in the soil temperature control section. 
Ivan soils are calcareous throughout. 
Kahola soils are calcareous between depths of 38 to 102 centimeters (15 to 40 inches).
Kennebec soils do not have a Bw horizon. 
Kenridge soils are moderately well drained.
Sturkie soils have have redoximorphic features, and have 0 to 10 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section
Worthen soils are drier in the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: derived from silty alluvium
Landform:  floodplain steps
Flooding: very rare
Duration: brief
Months: March to July
Slopes:  0 to 2 percent
Range of annual temperature: 11 to 13 degrees C. (52 to 55 degrees F.)
Range of annual precipitation: 86 to 102 centimeters (34 to 40 inches)
Frost-free period: 170 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chase, Kimo, Muscotah, Reading, and Wabash soils.
The Chase soils are somewhat poorly drained and somewhat lower on the floodplain. 
The Kimo soils are somewhat poorly drained and lower on the floodplain.
The Muscotah soils are somewhat poorly drained and are slightly lower on the floodplain. 
The Reading soils have an argillic horizon and are moderately well drained. 
The Wabash soils are poorly drained and lower on the floodplain.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shawnee County, Kansas, 1999.  This series is named for a town in Shawnee County in the Kansas River Valley.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 102 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (A1, A2, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 53 centimeters (0 to 21 inches) (Ap, A1, A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon: 53 to 145 centimeters (21 to 57 inches) (Bw1, Bw2 horizons)

These soils were formerly included with the Judson and Muir series. Pedon used for series is 94KS177011 (SS880-886).

Occasionally, there are buried soils deeper than 178 centimeters (70 inches) that contain higher clay content than the series allows. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available from the Lincoln, Nebraska, National Soil Survey Laboratory on Pedons S53KS177891, (SS2001-2007) and S53KS177892, (SS2008-2015). Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory 95KS087002 (SS892-SS897), 95KS087002 (SS892-897) and 96KS149013 (SS1157-1162).

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
