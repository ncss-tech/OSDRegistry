REDSTONE SERIES

The Redstone series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in loamy and sandy glacial till underlain by fragmental material.  They are on hills and mountain sides.  These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the solum and rapid permeability in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fragmental, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Redstone fine sandy loam - forested, very stony.  (Colors are for moist soil.)

 Oe--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed forest litter.

 E--2 to 5 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; few roots; 10 percent gravel up to 1 inch in size; strongly acid; abrupt broken boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

 Bh--5 to 7 inches; very dusky red (2.5YR 2/2) fine sandy loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; few roots; 10 percent gravel up to 1 inch in size; strongly acid; abrupt broken boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

 Bs1--7 to 10 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) gravelly fine sandy loam; moderate fine granular structure; friable; few roots; 20 percent weakly cemented (orstein); 20 percent gravel up to 1 inch in size; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Bs2--10 to 14 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; few roots; 45 percent gravel up to 1 inch in size; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 5 to 15 inches.)

 BC--14 to 19 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loamy sand; weak fine granular structure; friable; few roots; 25 percent gravel up to 1 inch in size; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

 C--19 to 67 inches; variegated dark brown (10YR 3/3) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravel; single grain; loose; 70 percent gravel up to 1 inch in size; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Carroll County, New Hampshire; Town of Conway.  Hurricane Mountain Road, 220 feet west and 100 feet south of parking area at the height of land on Conway State Forest.  USGS North Conway, NH-ME; 15 minutes Quadrangle; 44 degrees 4 minutes 12 seconds N and 71 degrees 4 minutes 14 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and the depth to fragmental material ranges from 11 to 25 inches; rock fragments range from 0 to 50 percent in the solum.  Rock fragments and very coarse sand range from 60 to 90 percent in the underlying fragmental material.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid throughout the soil.

The 0e horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Some pedons have an Oi horizon and some have an Oa horizon.

Some pedons have an A horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.

The E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.

The Bh or Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The B horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is similar to the B horizon.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is gravel.  The sand size is dominantly very coarse and coarse uncoated particles.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family.  The Becket, Colton, and Hermon soils are in related families.  Becket soils have firm substrata within the series control section.  Colton and Hermon soils have more than 5 percent fine-earth in the underlying material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redstone soils are on glaciated hilly uplands and mountains.  Slopes typically are 15 to 50 percent, but range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, and the frost-free season ranges from 60 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the shallow, somewhat excessively drained Canaan, and Lyman soils, the very deep, somewhat excessively drained Hermon soils, and the very deep, well drained Berkshire, Marlow, and Monadnock soils.  All of these soils occupy similar landscape positions.  The Berkshire and Marlow soils formed in loamy glacial till.  The Hermon and Monadnock soils are underlain by sandy glacial till.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Almost all areas are forested.  Forest vegetation is mainly Eastern white pine, sugar maple, red spruce, white spruce and American beech.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  White Mountains of New Hampshire.  The series is of slight extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carroll County, New Hampshire, 1974.

REMARKS:  The Redstone soils are not considered to be prime farmland.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1.  Albic horizon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Oe and E horizons).
2.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 7 to 14 inches (Bs horizon).  The Bh horizon does not meet the depth criteria for a spodic horizon.
