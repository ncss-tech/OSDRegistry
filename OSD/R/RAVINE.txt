RAVINE SERIES

The Ravine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale.  Ravine soils are on plains, fans and pediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, mesic Ustic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ravine silty clay loam, on a northeast facing, convex, 2 percent slope in grass at an elevation of 5235 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 17, 2001 the soil was dry throughout.

    Btk2--14 to 21 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silty clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very firm, extremely hard, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots throughout; 40 percent continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 8 percent medium distinct irregular carbonate masses; 2 percent angular gravel; violent effervescence (19 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 12 to 25 inches)

    Btk3--21 to 28 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong coarse prismatic parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very firm, extremely hard, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots throughout; 45 percent continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent medium and coarse distinct irregular carbonate masses; 2 percent angular gravel and 10 percent flat weakly cemented 2 to 75 millimeter shale fragments; violent effervescence (12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--28 to 40 inches; thin platy fractured, gypsiferous shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the fine smectitic family.  Similar series in the mixed family are the Alesna(NM), Hano(AZ), Keeseha(AZ), and Poley(AZ) series.   
Alesna soils: have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches
Hano soils: are moist December through March
Keeseha and Poley soils: do not have a paralithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium and residuum derived from shale
Landform:  plains, fans, pediments

SERIES PROPOSED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is a type of gully.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 3 to 23 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 3 to 28 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 28 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 14 to 21 inches.  (Bt2 horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with ? at ? inches.  (? horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with shale at 28 inches.  (Cr horizon)
Other features:  ustic aridic moisture regime.

Remarks:  This soil was separated from the Razor series due to the presence of calcic and argillic horizons.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
