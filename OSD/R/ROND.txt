ROND SERIES

The Rond soils consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone and limestone with some local influence from quartzite. Rond soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep plains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Gila County, Arizona.  NW 1/4 of Sec. 3, T6N, R16E, 1 mile north of Cottontail tank, Fort Apache Indian Reservation. (Note: - County is unsurveyed. Location is approximate and based on extended grid from surveyed areas.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Depth to bedrock: more than 40 inches

Depth to the Btk horizon: 36 to 50 inches

Soil moisture: These soils are dry for 90 cumulative days or more in most years in some subhorizon of the soil between 7 and 20 inches but are not continuously dry in all parts of the soil between these depths for as long as 60 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Mean annual soil temperature: 48 degrees F. to 56 degrees F.

A1 horizon
Hue: 5YR thru 10YR
Value: 4 and 5 dry and 2 and 3 moist
Chroma: 2 and 3
Texture: loam, silt loam, gravelly silt loam, very fine sandy loam, gravelly loam, clay loam, gravelly clay loam and cobbly clay loam

upper Bt horizon
Hue:5YR and 7.5YR
Value: 4 and 5 dry and 3 moist
Chroma: 2 and 3.
Texture: clay loam, heavy gravelly clay loam, cobbly clay loam, clay, gravelly clay and cobbly clay

lower Bt horizons
Hue: 5YR and 2.5YR
Value: 4 and 5 dry and 3 and 4 moist
Chroma: 3 thru 6. 
Texture: clay loam, heavy gravelly clay loam, cobbly clay loam, clay, gravelly clay and cobbly clay

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abrazo (NM), Cantina (NM), Carnero (NM), Celsosprings (NM), Charette (NM), Concho (NM), Cueva (NM), Judd (NM), Remunda (NM), Roundtop (AZ) and Philmont (NM) series. Abrazo, Carnero, Cueva and Roundtop soils have bedrock are moderately deep. Celsosprings, Charette, Cocho, Judd, Remunda and Philmont soils are very deep. Cantina soils have a lithic contact of basalt bedrock at 54 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rond soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep plains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils are formed in place in residuum from cherty limestone and limestone with some local influence from quartzite. Elevations range from 4500 to 6000 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 degrees F. to 58 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the Roundtop, Showlow, Dye and Jacks series these include the Lynx and Tortugas series. Lynx and Tortugas soils are dark-colored and lack the argillic horizon that is characteristic of the Rond soils, and Tortugas soils are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: These soils are well-drained. Runoff is medium and permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazing of livestock. Native vegetation includes pinon pine, juniper, shrub oak, blue grama, bear grass, mountain mahogany, ring muhly, sideoats grama and snakeweed with ponderosa pine at the higher elevations.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Gila County, Arizona and possibly Navajo and Apache Counties.  The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 39.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ft. Apache Indian Reservation, Gila Co., Arizona, 1971.  The name Rond is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 14 inches. (A, Bt1 horizons)

Argillic horizon: The zone from 3 to 48 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

Classification changed to Aridic subgroup in 2007. The change was made to be consistent with the moisture regime.

The Rond series was created to be the deeper counterpart to the Roundtop series.
