COMPETING SERIES:
Massapog series--occur on flood tidal delta flats in coastal lagoons; less than 5 percent gravel content throughout the profile

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--sandy lagoonal deposits
Landscape--Coastal estuaries, bays, and lagoons
Landform--Washover fan flats
Slope--0 to 5 percent
Mean annual precipitation--1023 to 1320 millimeters (40 to 52 inches)
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 13 degrees C (39.2 to 55.4 degrees F)
Water salinity range--18 to 30 parts per thousand
Frost free period--350 to 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anguilla and Napatree soils.

Anguilla soils--in mainland coves and have sulfidic materials within 50 centimeters of the soil surface.  These soils are underlain by glaciofluvial deposits.
Napatree soils--in submerged headlands and are underlain by glacial till deposits

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is permanently inundated with saline and brackish water with considerable tidal exchange which limits the development of sulfidic soil material.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses--Supports benthic aquatic habitat and is used for fishing and recreational and commercial shellfish harvesting; species are smelt, small cod, flounder, scup, menhaden, white perch
Native vegetation--Native algae and eelgrass (Zostera marina); vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 35 percent 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island coast
Land Resource Regions--R - Northeastern Forage and Forest Region; S - Northern Atlantic Slope Diversified Farming Region
MLRA(s)--MLRA 144A, 149B
Extent--Small
