RIN SERIES

The Rin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess. These soils are on hills and mountain slopes.   Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Rin silt loam, cultivated, on a 13 percent slope at an elevation of 1838 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Ap--0 to 19 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and common medium irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.

	A--19 to 51 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and common fine and medium tubular pores; few (5 percent) very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist krotovinas;; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 20 to 80 cm)

	AB--51 to 87 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine, fine, and medium and few coarse and very coarse tubular pores; common (25 percent) very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist krotovinas; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 37 cm thick)

	BA--87 to 104 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few (5 percent) very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist krotovinas; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 17 cm thick)

	Bw1--104 to 128 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and few medium tubular pores; common (30 percent) dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist krotovinas; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.

	Bw2--128 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few medium tubular pores; few pressure faces; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).

A or Ap horizons
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR moist
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry and moist

AB or BA horizons
Value: 2 or 3 moist

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lantonia series. Lantonia soils have secondary carbonates immediately below the cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
  Landscape: plateaus, alluvial plains, and mountains  
  Landform: hills and mountain slopes
  Elevation: 1615 to 2134 meters
  Slope: 0 to 45 percent, dominantly 2 to 20 percent
  Parent material: loess
  Mean annual air temperature: 2.2 to 5.0 degrees C. (cryic soil temperature
  regime)
  Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 635 mm
  Frost free period: 30 to 60 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tetonia, Lostine, and Kucera soils. All of these soils occur on the same landforms. Tetonia are on linear or convex positions on steep north slopes, and have a calcic horizon. Lostine and Kucera soils have a frigid soil temperature regime. Lostine soils are in swales. Kucera soils have a calcic horizon

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: well
Runoff: medium
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: dryland wheat, barley, hay, and grazing; irrigated wheat, barley, and seed potatoes
Dominant native vegetation: bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Nevada bluegrass, mountain big sagebrush, threetip sagebrush, snowberry, and balsamroot.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Teton County, Idaho, 1975; Teton Area, Idaho-Wyoming Soil Survey

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from a depth of 0 to 104 cm
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 104 to 152 cm
Particle-size control section: from a depth of 25 to 100 cm
