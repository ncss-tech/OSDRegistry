RAPADO SERIES

The Rapado series consists of moderately deep to petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, dominantly from volcanic tuffs and minor amounts of limestone.  The Rapado soils are on summits and side slopes of fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustalfic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rapado very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is partially covered with 35 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles.

(5 to10 cm thick)

    Btk1--8 to 28 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure: hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common fine carbonate coats on undersides of rock fragments; 35 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

    Btk2--28 to 61 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores; many fine carbonate filaments and soft masses; common fine  carbonate coats on undersides of rock fragments; 48 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 36 cm thick)

   Bk--61 to 81 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; many fine to coarse carbonate coats and pendants on vertical and undersides of rock fragments; 55 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

   Bkqm1--81 to 99 cm; white (10YR 8/1) indurated petrocalcic horizon with alternating lenses of strongly carbonate and accessory silica cemented material; 2 to 4 mm discontinuous laminar cap at top of pan, gradual wavy boundary.  (18 to 30 cm thick)

   Bkqm2--99 to 152 cm; white (10YR 8/1) strongly carbonate and accessory silica cemented petrocalcic horizon with common lenses of very gravelly loamy coarse sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand; light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rapado soils are on summits and side slopes of fan remnants and ballenas.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from volcanic tuff and minor amounts of limestone. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,160 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, intermittently moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pahroc and Leo soils. The Pahroc soils lack an argillic horizon.  Leo soils lack an argillic horizon and a petrocalcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, Nevada ephedra, banana yucca, and Joshua tree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Nevada.  Rapado soils are of limited extent.  MLRA 29.
