RUMPLE SERIES

The Rumple series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone.  These gently to moderately sloping soils occur on backslopes of low hills on dissected plateaus.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (degrees 65 F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, active, thermic Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rumple gravelly clay loam--rangeland.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 2.5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky and granular structure; very hard, firm; many roots; 15 percent angular chert fragments mostly 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  Thickness is 8 to 23 cm (3 to 9 in)

    Bt1--13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 in); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; many roots; few patchy clay films; 25 percent angular chert fragments less than 2 inches in diameter; few chert cobbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  Thickness is 10 to 18 cm (4 to 7 in)

    Bt2--25 to 66 cm (10 to 26 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) extremely gravelly clay, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm; common roots; 65 percent chert fragments less than 2 inches in diameter; few chert and limestone cobbles; common thin clay films on peds; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 36 to 79 cm (14 to 31 in)

    R--66 to 117 cm (26 to 46 in); white and gray indurated limestone, coarsely fractured; red clay in crevices.

The R layer 
Cementation: indurated or strongly cemented limestone and is dolomitic in some pedons. Chert and quartz fragments are embedded in the limestone in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Brico series in the same family. Similar soils are the Bexar, Georgetown, Rowden, Scullin, and Swenson series.
Brico soils: are more than 102 cm (40 in) deep over granitic materials.
Bexar, Georgetown, Rowden, Scullin, and Swenson soils: contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Georgetown and Scullin soils also occur in a more moist climate.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: Residuum and colluvium derived from limestone.
Landscape: Dissected plateaus
Landform: Summits, shoulders, and backslopes of Low hills
Slope: dominantly 1 to 4 percent, but ranges up to 8 percent
