GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Radioville soils are on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Radioville soils formed in loamy sediments overlying silty or clayey lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762  to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 466 meters (600 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gilford, Headlee, Medaryville, Rensselaer, Whiskerville, and Whitepost soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford, Rensselaer, and Whitepost soils are on similar landforms. The somewhat poorly drained Headlee and Medaryville soils are on swells. The moderately well drained Whiskerville soils are on higher swells.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy sediments and moderately low or low in the lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderate in the loamy sediments and slow or very slow in the lacustrine sediments.

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly used to grow corn, soybeans, and small grain. Native vegetation is swamp grasses and deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S98IN-131-010) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, NE. Transect data for the typical pedon (T98IN-131-068) is on file in the MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 50 percent Radioville soils, 40 percent Rensselaer soils, and 10 percent Whitepost soils.
