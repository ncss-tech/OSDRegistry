REDTOP SERIES

The Redtop series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite and schist. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains with slopes of 9 to 50 percent at elevations of 47 to 1391 meters (154 to 4564 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary rocks, schist and phyllite. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2030 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F). The mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The growing season is about 150 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Darkwoods, Firmountain, and Oakside soils. Darkwoods and Firmountain soils are loamy-skeletal with greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Oakside soils are shallow, 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) from the soil surface to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; high to very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone, Cascade barberry, and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. This series is of moderate extent.
