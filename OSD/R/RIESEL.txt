RIESEL SERIES

The Riesel series consists of very deep to gravelly alluvium, well drained soils that formed in clayey over gravelly alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, or siltstone of Cretaceous Age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on ancient treads of stream terraces on dissected plains. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 856 mm (33.7 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.1 degrees C (68.2 degrees F).

Axtell soils: have mottled B2t horizons, COLE of more than .07, and cracks more than 1 cm. wide that extend below 51 cm (20 in) depth.  
Lewisville and Venus soils: have mollic epipedons and lack argillic horizons.
Minwells soils: occur on positions similar to that of Riesel soils
Payne soils: occur on lower broad stream terrace positions
Travis sois: occur on sideslopes and ridges adjacent to Riesel soils

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Well; 
Permeability class: Slow
Runoff: medium on slopes less than 1 percent and high on slopes of 1 to 5 percent; slow internal drainage

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for pasture.  A very small acreage is cultivated to sorghums or oats for winter grazing.  Many areas are being mined for road gravel.  Native vegetation is mostly bluestems and indiangrass with an overstory of post oak and elm trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in central Texas in small areas along major streams. This soil occurs primarily in the Texas Blackland Prairies, Northern Part (MLRA 86A) and to a minor extent in the Grand Prairies (MLRA 85).  The series is of moderate extent.
