COMPETING SERIES:
Fauquier soils-have red Bt horizons, moderate permeability and is mapped in MLRAs 130, 147, and 148).
Lenberg soils--have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches, and formed in residuum of acid clayey shale, and occurs in the Pennyroyal and Western Coal Field Regions of Kentucky.
Montalto soils--have a red subsoil and occur on uplands of the northern Piedmont Plateau and Blue Ridge.
Needmore soils--have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches, formed in residuum from calcareous shale, and occur in the Ridge and Valley sections.
Norton soils--formed in fine textured till or colluvium, and occur in Triassic Basins of the northern part of the Piedmont Plateau in New Jersey.
Orenda soils--occur in the northern part of the Piedmont Plateau and have a moderate shrink-swell potential.
Peabody soils--have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches and formed in residuum derived from interbedded olive yellow siltstone and red clayey shale.
Pisgah soils--have a moderate permeability and formed in residuum weathered from limestone bedrock.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2005 

REMARKS: Rasalo soils were previously mapped as Enon soils. They replace Enon soils in the new mesic Piedmont region. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 30 inches (Bt horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
