SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Virginia and North Carolina
Extent: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2005

REMARKS: Rasalo soils were previously mapped as Enon soils. They replace Enon soils in the new mesic Southern Piedmont MLRA (136).  The September, 2025 revision updated the format.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 centimeters to 76 centimeters (6 to 30 inches) (Bt horizons)
