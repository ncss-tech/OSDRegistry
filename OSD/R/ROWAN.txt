SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rowan County, North Carolina, 2009.
REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with the Mocksville series which was reclassified as occurring in a mesic temperature regime. Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon).
Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 inches to a depth of 20 inches (Bt horizon).
