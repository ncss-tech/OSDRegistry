ROSENWALL SERIES 

The Rosenwall series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in clayey marine sediments derived from interbedded shale and sandstone.  They occur on uplands mainly within the Caddell, Manning and Wellborn Formations.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F); mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in).
