REDHOME SERIES

The Redhome series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Redhome soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redhome soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and footslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff, andesite, or basalt with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 5,400 to 6,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dosie, Menbo, and Softscrabble soils.  Dosie soils are clayey-skeletal, deep to bedrock, and have thick mollic epipedons.  Menbo soils are clayey-skeletal.  Softscrabble soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, and have thick mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Redhome soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, squawapple, Douglas rabbitbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 3,900 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
