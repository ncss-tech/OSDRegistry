RATHBUN SERIES

The Rathbun series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils occur on summits of interfluves, side slopes, and treads on high stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 2 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Appanoose County, Iowa, 1970.

REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 43 to 93 centimeters;
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon include:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 43 centimeters (A, E, and BE horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 142 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and Btg5 horizons);
udic moisture regime

This update relocates the type location to better represent the central concept of the Rathbun series.  The series has been reclassified because it does not meet the criteria for an Aqualf.
