ROCKYBUTTE SERIES

The Rockybutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over weathered porcelanite.  Rockybutte soils are on structual fans, terraces, broad ridges and plateaus.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arnor, Arwite, Celavar, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Evpark, Flugle, Fort Collins, Gateson, Iwela, Oldwolf, Olnest, Orlie, Parkelei, 
Rauzi, Stoneham, Toluca and Wagonhound series. None of these series have fragmental material at depths of less than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rockybutte soils are on lower sideslopes of structural fans and terraces and board summits of ridges and plateaus.  They formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over weathered porcelanite or very channery slopewash derived from porcelanite.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations ranges from 3,800 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deekay, Ironbutte, Moorhead and Muleherder soils.  Deekay and Moorhead soils are are on similar position on the landscape as Rockybutte soil.  They do not have fragmental material at depths of less than 40 inches.  In addition, Moorhead soils are fine.  Ironbutte soils are on narrow summits and ridges. They do not have argillic horizons and are shallow to fragmental material consisting of porcelanite.  Muleherder soils are on sideslopes.  They do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope; moderate over rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are utilized for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, needleandthread, blue grama and green needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Rockybutte soils occur in northeast Wyoming.  The series is of small extent.
