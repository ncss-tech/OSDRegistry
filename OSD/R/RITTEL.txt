RITTEL SERIES

The Rittel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on hills and sides of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rittel loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oe--0 to 5 cm; forest litter of partially decomposed needles and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.

    A--5 to 8 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots and common medium roots; 5 percent angular gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 13 cm thick)

    E--8 to 16 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thin and very thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; many light gray silt and sand skeletons on faces of peds; 10 percent angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 33 cm thick)

    Bt/E--16 to 26 cm; Bt part (90 percent) pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3); E part (10 percent) light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bt1--26 to 44 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium and coarse subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--44 to 67 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silty clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium and coarse subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual smooth boundary.
