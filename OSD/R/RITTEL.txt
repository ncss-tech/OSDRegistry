RITTEL SERIES

The Rittel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1987.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1177.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the surface to 4 inches (A and E horizons); an albic horizon from 1 to 4 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 4 to 32 inches (Bt/E and Bt horizons); a particle-size control section from 4 to 24 inches (Bt/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons); and a paralithic contact at a depth of 32 inches (Cr horizon).  The Rittel soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

Classification changed to Typic Haplustalfs in 1997.
