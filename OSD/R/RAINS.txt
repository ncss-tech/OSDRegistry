MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Berkeley County, South Carolina, 1948 

REMARKS: The central concept for the Rains series does not include a flooding hazard. However, the series has been correlated in flood plain positions. Additional research is needed to determine if areas of Rains soils that are subject to flooding have haplic or pale clay distribution. 

Diagnostic horizons, soil characteristics, and special features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 12 inches (A, E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 12 to 62 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)
Aquults feature--dominant chroma of 1 in the matrix of the argillic horizon, with masses of oxidized iron
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 0 to 80 inches of the soil surface at some time during the year (endosaturation)
Lithologic discontinuity--abrupt textural change starting at a depth of 79 inches (2Cg horizon)
