RAPID SERIES

The Rapid series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium weathered from rhyolite.  Rapid soils are on side slopes of canyons and have slopes of 20 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Palecryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rapid silt loam on a side slope of a canyon with 49 percent slope at an elevation of 1,783 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones.

 Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed fir needles; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Oe--3 to 8 cm; black (10YR 2/1) moderately decomposed plant material, black (10YR 2/1) moist; about 20 percent fiber; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the O horizons is 6 to 8 cm)

 A1--8 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

 A2--25 to 45 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, coarse and very coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 40 to 70 cm)

 AB--45 to 65 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and coarse, and few fine and very fine roots; common very fine irregular, fine tubular and dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

 Bt1--65 to 90 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium roots and few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and irregular pores; few (5 percent) skeletans on all faces of peds and very few (2 percent) faint clay films; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 25 cm thick)

 Bt2--90 to 152 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely stony clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; few medium roots; common very fine tubular, irregular, and dendritic tubular  pores; few (15 percent) distinct clay films; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 40 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8).
