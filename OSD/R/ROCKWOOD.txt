ROCKWOOD SERIES

The Rockwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy lodgment till of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  These soils are on convex slopes on shoulders, summits, and backslopes of drumlins and moraines.  These soils are deep to a densic contact.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 680 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Wadena County, Minnesota, 1929.

REMARKS:  
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 40 to 90 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 141 centimeters. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 40 centimeters (Ap and E horizons);
glossic horizon--the zone between 40 and 95 centimeters (B/E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 40 to 116 centimeters (B/E and Bt horizons);
base saturation--greater than 60 percent

The upper part of the profile appears to have been modified and stone lines have been identified in the field.  

The classification of Rockwood was changed in 2013 from Glossic Hapludalfs to Haplic Glossudalfs, due to the assumption that a B/E horizon contains 15 to 85 percent material from the B and E horizons, meeting the criteria of a glossic horizon instead of "interfingering of albic materials" which requires less than 15 percent E material in the argillic horizon.
