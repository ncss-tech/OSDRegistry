RUBICK SERIES 

The Rubick series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from coarse-grained igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on ridges and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 25 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rubick cobbly coarse sandy loam, very stony, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--2 to 0 inches; forest litter of partially decomposed needles, twigs and moss roots. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    E1--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. 

    E2--3 to 8 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; many very fine, fine and medium and common coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of E horizons is 3 to 11 inches thick). 

    Bw--8 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; many very fine, fine and medium and common coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary (15 to 30 inches thick). 

    BC--27 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely stony loamy coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist, single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium pores; neutral (pH 7.0).

Hiore (MT) - has less than 15 percent cobbles and stones throughout the profile; does not have E horizons. 

Millswitch (CO) p 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. 

Pergrin (CO) - is 20 to 40 inches deep to granite bedrock. 

Scout (UT) - has a udic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - ridges and sideslopes of mountains. 
Elevation - 5,500 to 8,000 feet. 
Slope - 25 to 60 percent. 
Parent material - colluvium and slope alluvium derived from coarse-grained igneous rocks. 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short cool summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 30 inches. 
Mean annual temperature - 36 to 40 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caseypeak, Tepecreek, and Worock soils. Caseypeak soils are shallow and on more convex positions. Tepecreek soils are moderately deep and have an argillic horizon. Worock soils have an argillic horizon. Tepecreek and Worock soils are on similar landform positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rubick soils are used primarily for timber production, watersheds and wildlife habitat.  The potential vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, pinegrass, common juniper, heartleaf arnica, Oregon grape, strawberry, woods pussytoes and elk sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Rubick soils are of small extent in Southwestern Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT3033. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (E1 and E2 horizons); a cambic horizon from 8 to 27 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw and BC horizons).   Rubick soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
