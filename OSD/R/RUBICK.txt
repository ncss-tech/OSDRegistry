RUBICK SERIES

The Rubick series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from coarse-grained igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on ridges and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 25 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rubick cobbly coarse sandy loam, very stony, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; forest litter of partially decomposed needles, twigs and moss roots. (3 to 8 cm thick) 

    E1--5 to 13 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. 

    E2--13 to 26 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; many very fine, fine and medium and common coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of E horizons - 8 to 30 cm). 

    Bw--26 to 74 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; many very fine, fine and medium and common coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary (35 to 75 cm thick). 

    BC--74 to 158 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely stony loamy coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist, single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium pores; neutral (pH 7.0).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT3033. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon--5 to 26 cm (E1 and E2 horizons)
Cambic horizon--26 to 74 cm (Bw horizon)
Particle-size control--25 to 100 cm (part of the E2, all of the Bw and part of the BC horizon)

Rubick soils have a cryic temperature regime and have an ustic soil moisture regime. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.

Converted to metric, updated formatting, and O horizons were updated to start at zero. Competing series section was not updated. 9/2022
