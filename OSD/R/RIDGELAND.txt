Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand 
Other features-- The A1 or Ap horizon commonly rests directly on the Bh horizon, but some pedons have a discontinuous E horizon of less than 2 inches 

Bh horizon:
Color-- hue of 5YR, and 7.5YR, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 4; or 10YR, value 3 with a chroma of 1, or value 2 or less with chroma 1 or 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand 
Other features-- These horizons are firm and somewhat brittle, and most sand grains are coated with organic matter 

E horizon (if it occurs):
Color-- hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand 
Other features--.  Many pedons have fragments of Bh material in this horizon 

Eg horizon (if it occurs):
Color-- hue of 7.5YR, 10yr or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 1 or 2
hue of 7.5YR, 10yr or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 1 or 2

Color-- hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand 
Other features--.  In some pedons, located under the Bh

Cg horizon (if it occurs):
Color-- hue of 7.5YR, 10yr or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 1 or 2
