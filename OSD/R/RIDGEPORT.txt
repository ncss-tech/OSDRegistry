RIDGEPORT SERIES

The Ridgeport series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of moderately coarse textured alluvium and the underlying calcareous sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on nearly level to convex slopes on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (Ap, A, and BA horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 99 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, and 2BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
