READING SERIES

The Reading series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium.  Reading soils are on flood-plain steps and stream terraces in Nebraska and Kansas Loess-Drift Hills, MLRA 106.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters (36 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

12/00 BCE, JCR
Range of Characteristics: Changed the "Depth to redox concentrations" back to the original series concept. Added a statement, that some pedons may have a BC Horizon.
Updated the competing series section
Restated ranges for mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature. 

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

09/2008 GJJ removed English units and made some format changes.

1/2015 DJK Updated climate data using 1981-2010 data. Updated RIC of mollic thickness, depth to redox, and PSCS clay content. Updated horizon ranges; split Bt into upper and lower, combined BC with C, changed to reaction classes rather than values. Updated competing series, distribution and extent, and additional data sections.
