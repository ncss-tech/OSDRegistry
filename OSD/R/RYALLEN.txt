RYALLEN SERIES

The Ryallen series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from igneous rock overlying lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ryallen extremely gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent cobble, 50 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary (2 to 5 inches thick).

    Bt--4 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobble, 40 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary (5 to 8 inches thick).

    Btk1--10 to 18 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very gravelly silty clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium prismatic parting to strong fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine through coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; few thin coats of calcium carbonate on undersides of rock fragments; 5 percent cobble, 35 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary (7 to 10 inches thick).

    Btk2--18 to 23 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) extremely gravelly silty clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common fine through coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films lining pores; common thin calcium carbonate filaments and common thin coats of calcium carbonate on undersides of rock fragments; few faint clay films lining pores; 5 percent cobble, 60 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary (4 to 8 inches thick).

    2Ck--23 to 60 inches; light gray (5YR 7/1) gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobble, 25 percent gravel; many coarse soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Bullis (TX) series.  Bullis soils do not have lacustrine sediments in the lower part, have a calcic horizon at 8 to 20 inches, have noneffervescent argillic horizons and clay loam, sandy clay loam or clay textures.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ryallen soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 3 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in fan alluvium from igneous rocks overlying lacustrine sediments of the Verde Formation.  Elevations range from 3,000 to 4,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hatranch and Bewearze soils.  Hatranch soil are shallow to lacustrine sediments and do not have an argillic horizon.  Bewearze soils have a cambic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ryallen soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and urban land.  The present vegetation is mesquite, mimosa, snakeweed, rabbitbrush, prickly pear and agave.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Arizona.  This series is of small extent.  MLRA is 38.  The name is derived from nearby Ryal and Allen Canyons.
