ROEBUCK SERIES

The Roebuck series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium derived mostly from the Permian red beds. These level to slightly concave soils are on broad smooth flood plains of streams that drain through back slough positions on terraces of large streams.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 1040 mm (41 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Aeric Epiaquerts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Roebuck clay, in a forest on a floodplain at an elevation of 195 meters (640 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium and fine granular structure; very hard, firm; common fine roots; few wormcasts; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentration masses; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [13 to 51 cm (5 to 20 inches) thick]

     Bw--25 to 114 cm (10 to 45 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; common fine roots; few slickensides; few wormcasts; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentration masses; few fine dark manganese concretions; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inches) thick]

     C--114 to 183 cm (45 to 72 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) dry; massive; very hard, firm; few roots; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentration masses and few fine distinct gray (5YR 5/1) redoximorphic depletion masses; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Okmulgee County, Oklahoma; about 1/2 mile west of Okmulgee; about 200 feet south and 200 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 11, T. 13 N., R. 12 E.; USGS Okmulgee South, Oklahoma topographic quadrangle; lat. 35.624022 degrees and long. -95.997972 degrees, WGS 84.

Some pedons have a 2C layer stratified with thin layers of silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Houlka series.
Houlka soils do not have a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roebuck soils occur on level to slightly concave flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in clayey or loamy alluvium derived mostly from Permian red beds.  Climate is moist subhumid to humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1140 mm (37 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 18 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F).  Elevation is 140 to 305 meters (460 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 60 to 80.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boxville, Caspiana, Garton, Karma, Kiomatia, Latanier, Moreland, Oklared, Pledger, Redlake, Redport, Ships, and Whakana series.  The Boxville, Karma, and Whakana soils are on distinct higher terraces above flooding and have an argillic horizon.  Caspiana and Garton soils are on slightly higher terraces and have an argillic horizon.  Kiomatia and Oklared soils are on lower flood plains and terraces.  Kiomatia soils are sandy and Oklared soils are coarse-loamy.  Latanier, Moreland, Redlake, Redport, and Ships soils are usually on the same terrace but slightly higher on the landscape and closer to the main stream.  Pledger soils are on similar landscapes but the parent material in upper part of the pedon has been derived from sources other than Permian red beds.  Redport soils are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 91 cm (0.5 to 3 feet) between November and May in normal years.  Potential for surface runoff is high on level surfaces and negligible on concave surfaces.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low (0.01 to 0.4 micrometers per second).  Permeability is very slow.  Frequent or occasional flooding occurs for brief to very long periods during the months of January through July.  Some areas are ponded for long periods from 0 to 30 cm (0 to 1.0 foot) following wet periods from October to June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Roebuck soils are used for growing cotton, soybeans, wheat, grain sorghum, and tame pasture.  Some areas are used for native range, forest, or wildlife.  Native vegetation is bottomland hardwoods with an understory of grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 84B, 87B, 112, 117, 118A, 133B in western Arkansas and Louisiana, central and eastern Oklahoma, and eastern Texas.  The type location is in MLRA 112.  The series is moderately extensive.
