REND SERIES

The Rend series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on convex shoulders and back slopes.  Rend soils formed in loess and other silty deposits which overlay silty or loamy valley materials.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Fragic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rend silt loam, on a linear, 6 percent back slope in a grass field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 2Btx2--102 to 127 cm (40 to 50 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; firm; few very fine roots between prisms; few prominent gray (10YR 6/1) silt coatings on faces of prisms; few distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common fine and medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; common fine spherical iron-manganese masses; about 20 percent sand; brittle; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 2Btx3--127 to 155cm (50 to 61 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure; firm; few distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; many fine and medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; few prominent black (2.5Y 2.5/1) iron-manganese stains on prisms; common fine and medium spherical iron-manganese masses; about 20 percent sand; brittle; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Weddel and Wrengart series.  Weddel soils have more than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Wrengart soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rend soils are on convex summits and shoulder slopes and on convex to linear back slopes of valley benches, mainly adjacent to tributaries of the Mississippi River.  Slope ranges from 5 to 10 percent.  Rend soils formed in 41 to 102cm (16 to 40 inches) of Peorian loess and in 76 to 152cm (30 to 60 inches) of other silty to loamy materials which overly valley fill materials.  The second increment of silty material is thought to be erosional sediments (pedisediment) or locally reworked A horizon of paleosols and early Wisconsinan loess (mixed zone).  It often contains a few igneous pebbles or coarse fragments from local bedrock deposited as glacial drift.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the bench phases of Bluford, Cisne, and Wynoose soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Bluford soils and poorly drained Cisne and Wynoose soils are on broader summits or in lower positions than the Rend soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained.  Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 feet to 3.5 feet) between December and April in normal years.  Potential for surface runoff is medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately low in the lower part.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and slow in the lower part.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used to grow corn, grain sorghum, soybeans, wheat and pasture.  Native vegetation is deciduous forest consisting mainly of oaks and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 113 and 114B in southern Illinois.  The series is of moderate extent.
