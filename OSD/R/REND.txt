REND SERIES

The Rend series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on structural benches. They formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits. Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 millimeters (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: 
Weddel soils have overlapping soil properties within the series control section. They are on till plains of Illinoian age at elevations greater than 139 meters. 
Wrengart soils have more than 14 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Rend soils are on treads and risers of structural benches that are mainly adjacent to tributaries of the Mississippi River. Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent. Rend soils form in 41 to 102 centimeters (16 to 40 inches) of loess (Peoria Loess) and in the underlying 76 to 152 centimeters (30 to 60 inches) of other silty or loamy deposits thought to be pedisediment or locally reworked A horizon of paleosols and early Wisconsin loess (Roxana Silt). This underlying material often contains a few igneous pebbles or coarse fragments from local bedrock deposited as glacial drift. 

Mean annual precipitation--1016 to 1143 millimeters (40 to 45 inches) 
Mean annual temperature--12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F) 
Frost-free period--190 to 225 days 
Elevation--116 to 139 meters (382 to 456 feet) above mean sea level

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the bench phases of the somewhat poorly drained Bluford soils and the poorly drained Cisne and Wynoose soils. These soils are below the Rend soils on treads but are on higher positions where the Rend soils are on risers.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--moderately well drained
Water table--depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 centimeters (2 feet to 3.5 feet) between January and May in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity class--moderately high in the upper part and low in the lower part
Permeability class--moderate in the upper part and very slow in the lower part 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas are used to grow corn, grain sorghum, soybeans, wheat and pasture. Native vegetation is deciduous forest consisting mainly of oaks and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
MLRAs 113 and 114 in southern Illinois. The series is moderately extensive.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Franklin County, Illinois, 1993

REMARKS: 
Rend soils are underlain by valley fill materials believed to consist of a Sangamon-age paleosol formed in outwash or ablation till from the Pearl Formation and Teneriffe Silt.

Typical Pedon Taxonomic Features-- 
Ochric epipedon--from the surface to a depth of 13 centimeters (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--from a depth of 13 to 155 centimeters (Bt and 2Btx horizons)
Fragic soil properties--coarse structure and brittleness from a depth of 61 to 155 centimeters (2Btx horizon).
