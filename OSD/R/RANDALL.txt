RANDALL SERIES

The Randall series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments derived from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on the floor of playa basins 3 to 15 m (10 to 50 ft) below the surrounding plain and range in size from 10 to more than 150 acres. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, thermic Ustic Epiaquerts

TYPE LOCATION: Floyd County, Texas; from the intersection of Farm Road 784 and U.S. Highway 70 in Floydada; 6.9 kilometers (4.3 miles west) on Farm Road 784; 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) south on ranch road; 91 m (300 ft) south in playa (Bois D-Arc Lake); Latitude: 33 degrees, 57 minutes, 44.13 seconds N; 
Longitude: 101 degrees, 24 minutes, 57.72 seconds W; Sandhill, Texas USGS quad; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An aquic moisture regime. These soils receive runoff from surrounding uplands and are moist for longer periods than normal for the climate. The soil cracks and is dry in parts of the upper 50 cm for more than 90 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June. These soils receive runoff from surrounding uplands and the soil moisture control section is moist for longer periods of time than is normal for the climate of the series province. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F). 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 25 to more than 152 cm (10 to more than 60 in). 
Depth to redox concentrations: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) and range from few to many. 
Depth to redox depletions: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) and range from none to common. 
Depth to episaturation: 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 in). 
Depth to slickensides: 13 to 64 cm (5 to 25 in). 
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in). 
Particle-size control section: 50 to 60 percent silicate clay. 
This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 8 to 13 cm (3 to 5 in) higher than microlows. Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow are about 1.5 to 4.6 m (5 to 15 ft). The microhigh makes up about 20 percent, the intermediate, or area between the high and low, about 40 percent, and the microlow about 40 percent. 
Cracks open and close each year except during higher-than-normal rainfall years, and remain open for 90 or more cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1 to 5 cm (0.4 to 2 in) wide cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 102 cm (40 in) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlows. 
COLE is more than 0.07. The range in characteristics represents 50 percent or more of each pedon unless otherwise stated.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation varies according to amount of water available. It includes knotgrass, bur ragweed, sedges, spike rushes, smartweed, saltmarsh aster, curly dock, frog-fruit, and bushy knotweed. In areas of standing water longbarb arrowhead, soft-stem bulrush and southern cattail may be present. Around the margins, where ponding occurs for shorter periods, the woody vegetation includes western willow and some cottonwood.
