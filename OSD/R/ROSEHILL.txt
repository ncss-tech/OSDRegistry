ROSEHILL SERIES

The Rosehill series consists of moderately deep to clayey shales, well drained soils formed in clayey residuum weathered from shale.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.)  Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches) at the type location. 
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Udertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rosehill silty clay in cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; very hard, firm, very plastic and very sticky; few open pores; about 1 percent by volume of light olive clayey shale fragments approximately 1 inch in diameter; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 33 centimeters (8 to 13 inches) thick)

   BA--23 to 48 centimeters (9 to 19 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine blocky structure; very hard, firm, very plastic and very sticky; few open pores; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (18 to 38 centimeters (7 to l5 inches) thick)

   Bw--48 to 69 centimeters (19 to 27 inches); mixed dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) and olive (5Y 5/4) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) and olive (5Y 4/4) moist; weak fine blocky structure; very hard, firm, very plastic and very sticky; about 2 percent by volume of fragments of soft clayey shale approximately 1 inch in diameter; few open pores; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (13 to 30 centimeters (5 to 12 inches) thick)

   C--69 to 91 centimeters (27 to 36 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, very plastic and very sticky; about 2 percent by volume of reddish brown shale fragments approximately 1 inch in diameter; few dark organic stains adjacent to root channels; few open pores; few small lime concretions; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (13 to 23 centimeters (5 to 9 inches) thick)

   Cr--91 to 102 centimeters (36 to 40 inches); about equal parts of light olive gray (5Y 6/2) and reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clayey shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Butler County, Kansas; 2.4 kilometers (1.5 mile) west and .4 kilometers (0.25 mile) south of Benton; 372 meters (1,220 feet) south and 76 meters (250 feet) east of northwest corner sec. 17, T. 26 S., R. 3 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Depth to paralithic contact with clayey shale: 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silty clay or clay loam
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

BA horizon:
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y
Value: 4 to 7, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: silty clay or clay
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Bw horizon: The color, texture, and reaction similar to the BA horizon

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y
Value: 4 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: clay or silty clay 
Reaction: moderately alkaline 
Mottles: brown or yellow in some pedons

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Benclare, Corson, Huntimer and Sutphen series.  
Benclare, Corson, Huntimer and Sutphen soils do not have a paralithic contact at depths less than 102 centimeters (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: very gently sloping to moderately sloping uplands  
Slope: generally 1 to 4 percent but range from 1 to 6 percent
Parent material: clayey residuum weathered from shale underlain by clayey shales 
Mean annual precipitation: 66 to 81 centimeters (26 to 32 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 58 degrees F.)
Thornthwaite's Annual P-E Index: 44 to 60

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Goessel, Irwin, Ladysmith, and Tabler soils.  
These soils generally occur higher on the slope or on ridgetops and do not have paralithic contact at depth less than 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: medium to high
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: low

USE AND VEGETATION:  The area is mainly cropland.
Principal crops are wheat and sorghums.
Some areas are in pasture and native range.  
The native vegetation was mid and tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and south-central Kansas.  The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Butler County, Kansas, 1970.  Series is named after Rose Hill in Butler County. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 48 centimeters (0 to 19 inches) (Ap and BA horizons)
Cambic horizon: 48 to 69 centimeters (19 to 27 inches) (Bw horizon)

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
