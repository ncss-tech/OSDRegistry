REDFISH SERIES

The Redfish series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. Redfish soils are on flood plains, fan remnants, and valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Redfish mucky peat, in a pasture; on a 1 percent slightly concave slope at 2103 meters elevation. When described on July 17, 1985 the soil was moist from the surface to a water table at 36 cm. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Oe--0 to 8 cm; mucky peat. (0 to 15 cm thick) 

  A--8 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 30 cm thick) 

  Ag1--18 to 28 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few fine prominent brown (10YR 5/3) iron masses; 45 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. 

  Ag2--28 to 46 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) iron masses; 50 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary. 

  Ag3--46 to 64 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent fine gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Ag horizons or when present the Bg horizon is 0 to 50 cm) 

  2Cg--64 to 160 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) extremely gravelly coarse sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Busterback, Fezip, Lilylake, Foxcreek, Furniss, Boquet, Zohner, Driggs, Feltonia, Badgerton, and Wiggleton soils. Busterback soils are on outwash fans and stream terraces, are pachic and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Fezip soils are on flood plains and have strongly contrasting particle-size control sections. Lilylake soils are on flood plains and have histic epipedons that are 25 to 41 cm thick. Foxcreek soils are on valley floors, flood plains and lower fan remnants and are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Furniss and Boquet soils are on valley floors, swales, and flood plains and are fine-loamy. Zohner soils are on valley floors and are fine-loamy. Driggs, Feltonia, Badgerton and Wiggleton soils are on fan remnants and have a xeric soil moisture regime.
