RIDGE SERIES 

The Ridge series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated interbedded sandy and loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ridge sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--1/2 inch to 0; slightly decomposed forest litter. (1/2 to 2 inches thick) 

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw1--2 to 6 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many very fine and few fine pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--6 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; common very fine and few fine pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of B horizons is 8 to 12 inches.) 

    Bk--12 to 16 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few very fine masses and fine threads of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick) 

    Cr--16 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) weakly consolidated sandy sedimentary beds that texture to loamy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; common fine roots in cracks; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). 

TYPE LOCATION:  Carter County, Montana; 2,500 feet north and 1,500 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 18, T. 8 S., R. 55 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F. 

Moisture control section - 8 to 20 inches and is moist in some part more than half the time during the growing season. 

Control section - 5 to 20 percent clay. 

Depth to Bk horizon - 10 to 16 inches. 

Depth to Cr horizon - 12 to 20 inches. 

Some pedons have a C horizon above the Cr horizon. 



A horizon - Value:  4, 5, or 6 dry; 3, 4, or 5 moist 

Chroma:  2, 3, or 4 

Texture:  sandy loam or loam 

Clay content:  5 to 20 percent 

Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 7.8 

The surface horizon, when mixed to a depth of 7 inches, does not meet the requirements for a mollic epipedon. 



Bw horizons - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y 

Value: 5, 6, or 7 dry; 4 or 5 moist 

Chroma:  2, 3, or 4 

Texture:  sandy loam or loam 

Clay content:  5 to 20 percent 

Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4 



Bk horizon - Hue:  10YR to 5Y 

Value:  6 or 7 dry; 4, 5, or 6 moist 

Chroma:  2, 3, or 4 

Texture:  sandy loam or loam 

Clay content:  5 to 20 percent 

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 15 percent 

Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4 



Cr horizon - semiconsolidated interbedded sandy and loamy sedimentary beds that texture to sandy loam or loamy sand. 

Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4 



COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - sedimentary plains and hills. 

Elevation - 3,000 to 4,600 feet. 

Slope - 4 to 65 percent. 

Parent material - residuum derived from semiconsolidated interbedded sandy and loamy sedimentary beds. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 19 inches. 

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 105 to 135 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ridge soils are used as grazeable woodland. Potential native vegetation is ponderosa pine with an understory of green needlegrass and western wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ridge soils are of limited extent on sedimentary uplands of eastern Montana.  Ridge is a place name.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:   Carter County, Montana, 1992. Proposed:  Carter County, Montana, 1980. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0591.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon when mixed to a depth of 7 inches (A and Bw1 horizons); cambic horizon - from 4 to 12 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); paralithic contact - at 16 inches. Ridge soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
