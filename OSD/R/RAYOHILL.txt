RAYOHILL SERIES

The Rayohill series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from gypsum rock. Rayohill soils are on knolls, alluvial fans and pediments. Slopes range from l to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about l2 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, gypsic, mesic Leptic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON: Rayohill fine sandy loam - on a small northeast facing knoll, slope of 4 percent at 6,110 feet elevation - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak thin platy and weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (l to 5 inches thick)

    Byl--1 to l3 inches; white (N 8/0) silt loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine discontinuous irregularly shaped pores; many very coarse rounded soft accumulations of fine gypsum crystals; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (l0 to l3 inches thick)

    By2--l3 to 25 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse and medium and common fine and very fine roots; common very fine discontinuous irregularly shaped pores; many very coarse rounded soft accumulations of fine gypsum crystals; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (5 to l2 inches thick)

    BC--25 to 33 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine discontinuous irregularly shaped pores; common medium rounded clusters of gypsum crystals; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (4 to l0 inches thick)

    2Cr--33 to 36 inches; weathered gypsum bedrock, gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    2R--36 inches; hard gypsum bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mccullan (AZ) and Netoma (NM) series. A similar soil is the Mussentuchit series.  Mccullen and Netoma soils are very deep. Mussentuchit soils have a calcic horizon and have an electrical conductivity of less than 4 dS/m.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rayohill soils are on knolls, alluvial fans and
pediments, which are underlain at moderate depths by gypsum or gypsiferous silt stone bedrock. Slope ranges from l to 6 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from l0 to l5 inches the average annual air temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F. The average frost-free period ranges from l50 to l80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ildecarb, Cerrillos, Clovis, Harvey, Jornaham, La Fonda, Penistaja, Pirodel, Tanbark and the competing Netoma soils. The Ildecarb soils are loamy-skeletal and have carbonatic mineralogy. Cerrillos, Clovis, Harvey, La Fonda and Penistaja are fine-loamy and do not have a paralithic contact within depths of 40 inches. Jornaham and Pirodel soils have calcic horizons. Tanbark soils have a paralithic contact within depths of 20 inches. Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,300 feet. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is very low.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rayohill soils are used for livestock grazing. Present vegetation is black grama, blue grama, gyp dropseed, algerita, soapweed yucca and one-seed juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Rayohill soils are of small extent in central New Mexico.
