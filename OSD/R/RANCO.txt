RANCO SERIES

The Ranco series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments derived from Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on the floor of playa basins 1.5 to 15 meters (5 to 50 feet) below the surrounding plain and range in size from 5 acres to more than 50 acres. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 457 mm (18 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Ustic Epiaquerts

TYPICAL PEDON: Ranco clay, midway between microhigh and microlow, 0.2 percent slope in playa basin at an elevation of about 902 m (2,960 ft). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

TYPE LOCATION: Lynn County, Texas; From the intersection of U.S. Highway 380 and U.S. Highway 87 in Tahoka; about 14.2 kilometers (8.8 miles) east on U.S. Highway 380; 644 m (0.4 mile) north in playa floor; Latitude: 33 degrees, 10 minutes, 16.2 seconds N; Longitude: 101 degrees, 38 minutes, 35.8 seconds W; New Lynn, Texas USGS quad; NAD 27. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An aquic moisture regime. These soils receive runoff from surrounding uplands and are moist for longer periods than normal for the climate. 
The soil cracks and is dry in some or all parts of the upper 51 cm (20 in) for more than 90 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June. Mean annual soil temperature: 16 to 18 degrees C (60 to 65 degrees F). 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 25 to more than 152 cm (10 to more than 60 in). 
Depth to redox concentrations: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) and range from few to many. 
Depth to redox depletions: 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 in) and range from none to common. 
Depth to episaturation: 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 in). 
Depth to slickensides: 13 to 76 cm (5 to 30 in). 
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in). 
Particle-size control section: 40 to 50 percent silicate clay. 
This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 8 to 13 cm (3 to 5 in) higher than microlows. Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow is about 1.5 to 4.6 m (5 to 15 ft). The microhigh makes up about 20 percent, the intermediate, or area between the high and low, about 40 percent, and the microlow about 40 percent. Cracks open and close each year, except during higher than normal rainfall years and remain open for 90 or more cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1 to 5 cm (0.4 to 2 in) wide cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 102 cm (40 in) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlows. COLE is more than 0.07. The range in characteristics represents 50 percent or more of each pedon unless otherwise stated.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: clayey lacustrine sediments derived from Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. 
Landform: on the floor of playa basins 1.5 to 15 m (5 to 50 ft) below the surrounding plain and range in size from 5 acres to more than 50 acres. 
Slopes: range from 0 to 1 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (58 to 63 degrees F). 
Mean annual precipitation: 381 to 508 mm (15 to 20 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the similar Sparenberg series and Acuff, Amarillo, Arch, Drake, Estacado, Midessa, Pep, Portales, and Posey series. These soils do not have aquic conditions. 
Sparenberg soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Acuff, Amarillo, Estacado and Posey soils are on surrounding plains and have an argillic horizon. 
Arch, Drake, Midessa, Portales, and Pep soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Very slow permeability. Runoff is negligible. These soils are frequently ponded for long or very long periods in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation varies according to amount of water available. It includes knotgrass, bur ragweed, sedges, spike rushes, smartweed, saltmarsh aster, curly dock, frog-fruit, and bushy knotweed. In areas of standing water longbarb arrowhead, soft-stem bulrush, and southern cattail may be present. Around the margins, where ponding occurs for shorter periods the woody vegetation includes western willow and some saltcedar. This soil has been correlated to the Playa (077CY027TX) range site in MLRA-77. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of west Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is of moderate extent.
