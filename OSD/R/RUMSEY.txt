RUMSEY SERIES 

The Rumsey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium derived from calcareous argillite, limestone and glacial till.  These soils are on mountains and glacial moraines.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rumsey gravelly ashy silt loam, 15 to 35 percent slopes, in woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 inches to 2 inches; slightly decomposed forest litter.

    Oe--2 inches to 3; decomposed forest litter.

    Bw1--3 to 11 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel; high amount of volcanic ash; moderately acid (ph 5.6); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 14 inches thick) 

    2Bw2--11 to 19 inches, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 10 percent cobbles, 45 percent gravel; slightly acid (ph 6.2); clear wavy boundary.

(9 to 15 inches thick) 

    2Bk3--41 to 63 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; 20 percent cobbles, 55 percent gravel; many prominent lime casts on all sides of coarse fragments; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (ph 7.8).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1498.  Diagnostic  horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ash influenced ochric epipedon from 0 to 8 inches (Bs horizon); a cambic horizon from 8 to 16 inches (2Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (2Bw, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons).  Rumsey soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups.  This series would also meet Haplustandic subgroup criteria.  The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
