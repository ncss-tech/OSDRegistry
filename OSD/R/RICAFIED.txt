RICAFIED SERIES

The Ricafied series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite, with some loess influence. Ricafied soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and ridges. Slope ranges from 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ricafied gravelly loam on a 45 percent south aspect in rangeland, at an elevation of 1955 meters. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 7 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary

 A2--7 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravely loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate and strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; few very fine and common fine irregular pores; 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent channers; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary

 Bk1--18 to 28 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; few fine irregular pores; common (7 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions (less than 1 mm) on bottoms of rock fragments; 18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent channers; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary

 Bk2--28 to 87 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard; firm; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; few fine irregular pores; common (12 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions (less than 1 mm) around rock fragments; 24 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 10 percent gravel, 35 percent channers, and 25 percent flagstones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt wavy

 R--87 cm; fractured limestone

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bezzant, Cedarhill, Dennot, Eaglecone, Georgecanyon, and Pyrenees series. Bezzant, Cedarhill, Dennot, Eaglecone, and Georgecanyon soils are very deep to bedrock. Pyrenees soils have less than 18 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape - Mountains and hills
Landform - Mountain slopes, hillslopes, ridges
Elevation - 1,550 to 2,450 meters
Slope - 15 to 70 percent
Parent material - Colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite with some loess influence
Mean annual temperature - 2 to 4 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation - 400 to 500 millimeters
