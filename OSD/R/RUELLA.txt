RUELLA SERIES

The Ruella series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable, upland soils. They formed in old alluvium of reddish hue in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), AND mean annual precipitation is 762 mm (30 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Udic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ruella loam - cultivated, at an elevation of 428 m (1405 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ak--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable; few small, calcium carbonate concretions on surface and throughout upper 6 inches; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 38 cm [4 to 15 in])

   Bk--23 to 81 cm (9 to 32 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable; common fine threads of calcium carbonate and few small and medium calcium carbonate concretions comprising about 5 percent of the soil mass; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Bk horizon is 38 to 89 cm [15 to 35 in])

   C--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive but porous; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Harper County, Kansas; about 7 miles west and 2 miles south of Anthony, Kansas; about 550 feet west and 300 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 3, T. 34 S., R. 8 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the family.  Soils in similar families include the Berda, Berthoud, Case, Gerlane, Midessa, Nashville, Quinlan, Shep, Weymouth and Woodward series. 
Berda, Berthoud, and Midessa soils: are drier for longer periods  
Case, Shep, and Weymouth soils: have calcic horizons  
Gerlane soils: have mollic epipedons and a coarse-loamy control section  
Nashville and Woodward soils: have bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in)
Quinlan soils: have bedrock at depths less than 51 cm (20 in)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: formed in old alluvium of reddish hue
Landscape: alluvial plains
Landform: stream terrace
Slope: 0 to 10 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 737 to 787 mm (29 to 31 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 13.9 to 16.1 degrees C (57 to 61 degrees F) Frost-free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 396 to 473 m (1300 to 1550 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carman, Devol, Eda, Grant, Nashville, and Tivoli soils.  
Carman, Devol and Grant soils: have argillic horizons and are on adjacent positions  
Nashville soils: have bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in), and are on higher positions 
Eda and Tivoli soils: have sandy control sections and are on adjacent hummocky areas

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Permeability: moderate
Runoff: medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes and high on slopes over 5 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated with wheat and sorghums being the principal crops.  Native vegetation is mid and tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A) of south-central Kansas and adjacent parts of Oklahoma.  The series is not extensive.
