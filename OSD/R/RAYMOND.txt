RAYMOND SERIES

The Raymond series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from siltstone or sandstone. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 35 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, shallow Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Raymond gravelly loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 4 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, few medium and coarse roots throughout; many fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 cm thick)

 Bw1--4 to 18 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, few medium and coarse roots throughout; many fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

 Bw2--18 to 30 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very flaggy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots throughout; common fine irregular pores; 20 percent flagstones and 30 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 15 to 30 cm)

 C--30 to 48 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely flaggy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine irregular pores; 30 percent flagstones and 45 percent channers; 25 percent carbonate concretions on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (12 to 26 cm thick)

 Cr--48 cm; sandstone bedrock.
