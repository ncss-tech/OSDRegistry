During the dry season February to May surface water ranges from 15 to 76 centimeters (6 to 30 inches).  

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: water quality and wildlife habitat.  
Dominant vegetation: These include but are not limited to Jamaica swamp sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), maidencane (Panicum hemitomon), Muhlenberg maidencane (Amphicarpum muelenbergianum), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), bulltongue arrowhead (Sagittaria lancifolia), bent alligator-flag (Thalia geniculate), pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens), bald cypress (T. distichem), swamp bay (Persea palustris), pond apple (Annona glabra), and red maple (Acer rubrum).
