RELYEA SERIES

The Relyea series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone and calcareous argillite.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.
