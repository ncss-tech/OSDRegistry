ROTHIEMAY SERIES

The Rothiemay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium mainly from limestone and calcareous shale and siltstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, knolls and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rothiemay loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).
