RADER SERIES

The Rader series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in slightly acid to alkaline clayey and loamy alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and terrace remnants on inland dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

Crockett soils:  occur on broad ridges and have a fine-textured control section and smectitic mineralogy
Derly soils:  occur similar positions, but have a fine-textured control section and smectitic mineralogy
Lufkin soils:  occur on slightly higher positions and have a fine-textured control section and smectitic mineralogy
Robco soils: occur on slightly higher positions in drains and is less drained

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent, and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  These soils have a perched water table above the Bt horizon during periods of prolonged rainfall from December to May.
