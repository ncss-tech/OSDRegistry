REEDWEST SERIES

The Reedwest series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from soft, calcareous, sandy and loamy sedimentary beds.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, dikes and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Reedwest loam, in cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium and fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; many fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--6 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--13 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 6 to 20 inches.)
