REVENTON SERIES
The Reventon series consists of deep, well drained soils
that formed in alluvium from sedimentary and igneous rocks.
These soils are on concave side slopes. Slopes range from 0
to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches
and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Reventon loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for
dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

A--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown
(10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular, moderate thin
platy structure in the top inch; soft, very friable,
nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots;
mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8
inches thick)

Bt1--7 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam; dark
brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure
parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard,
friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine
roots; continuous thin clay films on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth
boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

Bt2--16 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown
(7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky
structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and
very fine roots; continuous thick clay films on faces of
peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4);
gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 20 inches thick)

Btk--25 to 40 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay
loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and very
fine roots; few thick partial clay films on vertical faces
of peds; violently effervescent; common fine filaments of
calcium carbonate; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual smooth
boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

C--40 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown
(7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly
sticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; many
krotovinas 2 to 10 inches in diameter; violently
effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, New Mexico; about 3 miles
south of Corona; 275 feet north and 25 feet east of SW
corner of Sec. 20, T. 1 S., R. 13 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the
soil moisture control section December through April and
July through October.  The soil is driest during May and
June.

Soil Temperature:  52 to 57 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon:  10 to 20 inches thick

Depth to the base of the argillic horizon:  25 to 60 inches

A horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3
Texture:  loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam

Bt horizon:  Hue - 7.5YR or 5YR
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 through 6
Percent clay:  18 to 35 percent
Percent sand:  less than 45 percent

Btk or C horizon:  Hue - 5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 through 7
Chroma:  4 through 6
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  less than 15 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Glenham, Gosper, Hennings,
Houdek, Ree, Wewela, and Wineg soils.  Glenham, Gosper,
Hennings, Houdek, Ree, and Wewela soils are moist in at
least some part of the soil moisture control section during
May and June.  In addition, Glenham, Houdek, and Ree soils
have mean annual soil temperature less than 52 degrees F.
Gosper soils have a Bt horizon less than 13 inches thick.
Wewela soils are less than 40 inches to a paralithic
contact.  Wineg soils have calcic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reventon soils are on the concave side
slopes between low limestone ridges.  The slopes range from
0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from
nearby ridges and mountains underlain by limestone or basic
igneous rocks.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 to
55 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to
16 inches, but the soil receives an additional 4 to 6 inches
from surrounding areas.  Elevations are 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  Frost-free period is about 160 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Penistaja,
Plack, Sampson and Tortugas soils.  Penistaja soils lack a
mollic epipedon.  Plack soils are 20 inches to a petrocalcic
horizon.  Sampson soils have a thicker mollic epipedon.
Tortugas soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff;
moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use is rangeland.  The
present vegetation is western wheatgrass, sideoats grama,
blue grama, wolftail, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Reventon soils are of small extent
in southcentral New Mexico.
