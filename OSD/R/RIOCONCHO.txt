RIOCONCHO SERIES

The Rioconcho series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey or silty alluvium derived from limestone. These nearly level soils occur on flood plain steps of river valleys or dissected plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Torrertic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rioconcho clay loam--rangeland. 
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A1--0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular and moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, but crushes easily to granules, sticky, and plastic; many fine roots; few fine pores; few wormcasts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. 

    A2--36 to 91 cm (14 to 36 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, but crushes easily to granules, sticky, and plastic; few fine roots, few fine pores and wormcasts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary.  Combined thickness of the A horizon is 40 to 102 cm (16 to 40 in)

    Bk--91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam; brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine angular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky, and plastic; few fine roots; patchy thin coatings of calcium carbonate on surfaces of peds, and threads of calcium carbonate in pores above 70 inches; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

Iraan: has a fine-silty particle-size control section
Oakalla: has a fine-loamy particle-size control section and is in the typic-ustic moisture regime
Rio Diablo: has lower COLE values and does not have vertic features
Vanderpool: has a fine-loamy particle-size control section and is in the typic-ustic soil moisture regime

Elevation: 427 to 805 m (1400 to 2650 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Angelo, Dev, Iraan, Lipan, and Mereta series.
Angelo soils: have a calcic horizon at depths of less than 102 cm (40 in) and occur higher in the landscape.
Dev soils: are in the loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and occur on similar positions.
Iraan soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section, do not have vertic properties, and occur on similar positions.
Lipan soils: is a vertisol with intersecting slickensides and occur on higher positions.
Mereta soils: are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and occur on higher positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is medium. The soil is frequently or occasionally flooded for brief or very brief periods.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are cropland or rangeland. Cultivated crops include cotton, grain sorghum, wheat, and oats.  Native rangeland vegetation includes buffalograss, Texas wintergrass, vine mesquite, mesquite, hackberry, and pecan.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Edwards Plateau of Texas; LRR I - Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region; MLRA 81A - Edwards Plateau, Western Part. The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Tom Green County, Texas; 1971.

REMARKS:  The soils were formerly included in the Frio series.

The taxonomy was changed from Vertic Haplustolls to Torrertic Haplustolls because these soils occur in an aridic-ustic soil moisture regime.(2013 THW, RFG)

Edited 12/2013 (RFG-THW): Changed to fabular format and added metric values. Upedated the competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 91 cm (0 to 36 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon - 91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 in) (Bk horizon, does not have enough carbonates to be a calcic) 
Torrertic feature - Linear extensibility exceeds 6 cm within 100 cm (40 in) of the surface, and the soil has cracks greater than 5 mm that extend from the surface to greater than 50 cm (20 in) and the moisture control section in normal years is dry in some or all parts for six-tenths or more of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is higher than 5 degrees C.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The Irion County Soil Survey has engineering index test data published from 1977.
