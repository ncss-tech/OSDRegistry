RECAPTURE SERIES

The Recapture series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in reworked eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Recapture soils are on mesas and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Recapture fine sandy loam in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    E1--0 to 2 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine platy structure; soft, very friable; common very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    E2--2 to 10 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Btn1--10 to 16 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint patchy clay films in pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick).

    Btn2--16 to 28 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few fine crystals of gypsum and other salts; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 22 inches thick).

    Btn3--28 to 42 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few faint patchy clay films in pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

    C--42 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) silt loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).
