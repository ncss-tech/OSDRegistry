RELLEY SERIES

The Relley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed dominantly volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on fan skirts and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Haplocambids

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 52 miles southwest of Battle Mountain; about 660 feet south and 530 feet east of the northwest corner of section 12, T. 24 N., R. 40 E.; USGS Gilbert Creek NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 58 minutes 26 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 25 minutes 57 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.9738889 latitude, -117.4325000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry late May through November; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to duric horizon: 28 to 64 cm.
Depth to carbonates: 28 to 64 cm
Relict mottles: Faint or distinct relict mottles are common in any horizon below 41 cm.
Salt and sodium: These soils are normally moderately or strongly salt and sodium affected at depths below 76 cm.
Volcanic ash: A layer of volcanic ash 10 to 20 cm thick is common at some depth between 41 to 114 cm.
Other features: Some pedons have coarse sandy loam textures below depths of 127 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  18 to 27 percent.

A horizon

Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR

Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Bw horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry.
Structure:  Prismatic, platy or subangular blocky.
Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard, very friable or friable; slightly sticky or sticky and slightly plastic or plastic, wet.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Bq, Bk and Bqk horizons
Value:  5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Silt loam with strata of very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.
Structure:  Platy or it is massive.
Consistence: Slightly sticky or sticky and slightly plastic or plastic, wet.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.
Carbonates:  Slightly or violently effervescent, noneffervescent Bq horizons are overlying Bkq horizons in some pedons.

Other features:  A continuous weakly or strongly cemented hardpan is below 127 cm in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Antel series.  

Antel soils have a silty clay loam particle-size control section with 27 to 35 percent clay and are moderately well drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Relley soils are on fan skirts and inset fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mostly volcanic rocks, with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,650 meters. The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Batan, Bubus, Creemon, Cren, Hessing, Wholan, and the competing Antel soils.  Batan soils lack a cambic horizon and are calcareous throughout the profile.  Bubus soils are coarse-loamy.  Creemon, Cren, and Wholan soils are coarse-silty.  Hessing and Wholan soils lack a Bq horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Many areas are irrigated and used for growing alfalfa seed, grass seed, small grains or as hayland and pasture.  The dominant vegetation is shadscale, halogeton, Russian thistle, pepperweed and other mustards.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  MLRA 24, 25.  These soils are not extensive.
