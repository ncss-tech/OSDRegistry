RODIE SERIES

The Rodie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Rodie soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the McCann series.  McCann soils have horizons with durinodes in a friable matrix and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rodie soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,505 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 75 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pequop, Quarz, Shalcleav, Shalper, and Sumine soils.  All of these soils have argillic horizons and subhorizons which do not have secondary carbonates or silica accumulation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rodie soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, cheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Idaho fescue, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 25.

REMARKS:  The revision of June 2001 updates the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aridic Duric Haploxerolls and corrects the geographic coordinates of the type location.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A1, A2, and A3 horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 36 to 66 cm (Bw horizon).
Duric feature and identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 66 to 152 cm (Bqk1, Bqk2, Bqk3, and Bqk4 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw, Bqk1, Bqk2, Bqk3 and parts of the A3 and Bqk4 horizons).
