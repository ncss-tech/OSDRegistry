RUBSON SERIES

The Rubson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers. Rubson soils are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 775 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Frycanyon soils: have secondary calcium carbonate

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rubson soils are on terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers.  The climate is subhumid with cold wet winters and warm relatively dry summers.  Elevation is 530 to 860 meters. The average annual precipitation is 625 to 825 mm, and average annual air temperature is 5.6 to 7.8 degrees C. The average frost-free period is 100 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Artnoc, Caboose, Crash, Elmira, Frycanyon, Porthill, Selle, and Wishbone soils. Artnoc, Caboose, Crash, and Wishbone soils are on terrace escarpments, have hues of 5Y in the solum and are not vitrandic. Elmira and Selle soils are on dunes and terraces and are sandy. Frycanyon soils are on terraces and have Bk horizons. Porthill soils are on terraces and are fine textured in the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Woodland, wildlife habitat, recreation and dry cropland. The principal crops are small grains, alfalfa hay, clover seed and pasture. Some areas are used for Christmas tree plantations and homesites. Natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, western white pine, Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western larch with an understory of myrtle pachystima, baldhip rose, longtube twinflower, queencup beadlily; starry false Solomon's seal, common prince's pine, darkwoods violet, and western rattlesnake plantain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho, Montana, and possibly northeastern Washington. The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 44A
