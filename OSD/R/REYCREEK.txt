REYCREEK SERIES

The Reycreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Natrustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Reycreek loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine, common fine and few medium pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Btn--6 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine, common fine and few medium pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 16 inches thick)

    Bkn--20 to 36 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; common fine and few medium pores; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Bkg--36 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine, fine and medium pores; violently effervescent, common medium masses of lime; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

Sorum (SD) - does not have a calcic horizon; has an E horizon; is well drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  

Landform - stream terraces.
Elevation - 4,100 to 4,400 feet.
Slope - 0 to 2 percent.
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Reycreek soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mainly alkali sacaton, inland saltgrass, western wheatgrass, sedges and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Reycreek soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1457.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A horizon); a natric horizon from 6 to 20 inches (Btn horizon); a calcic horizon from 20 to 36 inches (Bkn horizon); a particle size control section from 6 to 20 inches (Btn horizon).  Reycreek soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
