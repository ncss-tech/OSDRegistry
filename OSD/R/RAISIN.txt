MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Goliad County, Texas 2009.  The name is for a community in Victoria County.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Delfina series.  The Delfina series has aquic conditions and the series province is confined to MLRA 83D in the lower Rio Grande valley.  The redoximorphic features in the argillic horizon are not contemporary.  These soils are in association with other soils that have borderline siliceous/mixed mineralogy. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 48 to 98 cm (19 to 39 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19 in) (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt5, Bt5, Btk horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 171 to 203 cm (67 to 80 in). (Btk horizon)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 12 to 138 cm (5 to 54 in) (Bt horizons)
Abrupt textural change: 47 to 49 cm (19 to 20 in) (Contact between E and Bt1 horizons 
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from Goliad and Refugio Counties.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  National Soil Survey Lab data on pedon number 08N0164 from the type location and on pedon number 08N0163 in Goliad County, Texas.
