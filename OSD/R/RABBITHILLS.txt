RABBITHILLS SERIES

The Rabbithills series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks. Rabbithills soils are on lake terraces and fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xereptic Haplodurids

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Rouette, Scalade, Shabliss, Trio, Truvar, and Unius series. 

Rouette soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October. Scalade soils contain free carbonates above the duripan. Shabliss soils have cambic horizons and have duripans that are strongly cemented. Trio soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Truvar soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C and have duripan that are 100 to 117 cm thick. Unius soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rabbithills soils are on lake terraces and fan remnants. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,525 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Borobey, Morehouse, and Seharney soils. Borobey and Morehouse soils are very deep, ashy, and do not have duripans. Seharney soils have lithic contacts underlying the duripan at depths between 33 to 76 cm. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Rabbithills soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
