RINGO SERIES

The Ringo series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from shale.  These soils are on uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Entic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ringo silty clay on a concave slope in a pasture at an elevation of 270 meters (886 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches); black (10YR 2/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots, slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) thick]

   BA--25 to 41 centimeters (10 to 16 inches); very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) silty clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; many fine roots; few small fragments of soft, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) shale; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  [10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) thick]

   Bw--41 to 66 centimeters (16 to 26 inches); olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) silty clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine roots; few fine carbonate concretions; few small fragments of soft, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) shale; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  [13 to 46 centimeters (5 to 18 inches) thick]

   Cr--66 to 102 centimeters (26 to 40 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) and light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) soft calcareous shales.

TYPE LOCATION:  Crawford County, Kansas; 5 kilometers (3 miles) east and 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) north of Farlington; 91 meters (300 feet) north and 37 meters (120 feet) west of the southeast corner of sec. 4, T. 28 S., R. 24 E.; USGS Hiattville topographic quadrangle; lat. 37.630764 degrees and long. -94.777767 degrees, WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Depth to paralithic contact:  51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches)  
Thickness of mollic epipedon:  20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches)
Thickness of cambic horizon:  23 to 71 centimeters (9 to 28 inches)
Thickness of solum:  51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches)
Clay content in the particle-size control section (weighted average):  35 to 50 percent
Note:  free carbonates in mollic epipedon (lower part)

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry
Chroma: 1 or 2
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 4 or 5, 5 or 6 dry
Chroma: 2 to 4  
Reaction: moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Ringo soils are on upland side slopes that have a slightly concave surface.  Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent, ranges of 3 to 10 percent are typical.  The soil formed in clayey residuum of weathered calcareous shales.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 910 to 1140 millimeters (36 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 16 degrees C (57 to 60 degrees F).  Elevation is 244 to 345 meters (800 to 1130 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 64 to 80.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clareson, Dennis, Lula, Summit, and Zaar soils. Clareson and Lula soils have argillic horizons and are on higher topographic positions than Ringo soils.  The Dennis, Summit, and Zaar soils lack a paralithic contact within 102 centimeters (40 inches) of the surface and are below Ringo soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Moderately well drained.  Potential for surface runoff is medium or rapid.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.4 to 4 micrometers per second) in the upper part and moderately low (0.4 to 1.4 micrometers per second) in the lower part of the series control section.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ringo soils are used mostly for pasture and native grass meadow. Small areas are cultivated to soybeans, grain, sorghum, and wheat. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 112 in southeastern Kansas and probably adjacent parts of Missouri and Oklahoma.  The Ringo series is of moderate extent.
