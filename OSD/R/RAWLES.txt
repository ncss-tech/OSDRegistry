RAWLES SERIES

The Rawles series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in alluvium. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Rawles silt loam, on a nearly level slope, on a flood plain, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 1,000 feet above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; very weak fine granular structure; very friable; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

 C--8 to 26 inches; stratified very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; massive, with weak, thin alluvial stratification; very friable; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 31 inches thick)

 Ab1--26 to 35 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 Ab2--35 to 44 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

 Ab3--44 to 60 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral. (Combined thickness of the Ab horizon is 24 to 40 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION: Mills County, Iowa; about 3 miles northeast of Glenwood; located about 500 feet west and 75 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 31, T. 73 N., R. 42 W.; USGS Glenwood quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees 04 minutes 25 seconds N. and long. 95 degrees 42 minutes 40 seconds W., NAD 83.

Depth to buried horizons--20 to 40 inches
Content of clay in the particle-size control section (weighted average)--18 to 27 percent
Content of sand in the particle-size control section (weighted average)--less than 15 percent fine sand and sand coarser than fine sand

Ap or A horizon:
Hue--10YR

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--alluvium
Landform--flood plains
Slopes--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--650 to 1,100 feet above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--47 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation--26 to 34 inches
Frost-free period--145 to 175 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kennebec, McPaul, and Napier soils.
Kennebec--are in landscape positions similar to those of Rawles soils, have a mollic epipedon that are more than 40 inches thick, and have a saturated zone between depths of 3 to 6 feet during April to June in normal years
McPaul--are in landscape positions similar to those of Rawles soils and have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section
Napier--are on foot slopes adjacent to uplands, have a mollic epipedon 24 to 40 inches thick, and do not have a saturated zone within a depth of 6 feet in normal years

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a saturated zone occurs at depths between 2 to 4 feet during March to June in normal years and is considered apparent
Permeability--moderate
Surface runoff potential--low
Flooding--occasional or rare flooding for brief or very brief periods during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. The native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR M, MLRAs 105 and 107; southwestern Iowa and southeastern Minnesota. This series is of small extent

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Mills County, Iowa, 1979.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 10 to 40 inches (C, Ab1, and Ab2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 60 inches (Ap, C, Ab1, Ab2, and Ab3).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon);
buried layers with 3 to 4 percent organic matter--the zone from a depth of 26 to 60 inches (Ab1, Ab2, and Ab3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
