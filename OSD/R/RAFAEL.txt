RAFAEL SERIES

The Rafael series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly to moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium on flood plains, alluvial flats.  Slopes are range from 1 0 to 3 percent.  Average Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on flood plains, alluvial flats, drainageways and in narrow alluvial valleys.  Dominant slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Parent material is alluvium washed mostly from marine shale, and to some extent, fine-grained calcareous sandstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual temperature is 47 45 to 54 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 110 to 160 days.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 11 inches with peak periods in July to October and evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the year.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are in the Billings, Hunting, and Ravola soils.  Billings soils do not have redoximorphic features lack mottles  above 20 inches.  Both Hunting and Ravola soils contain 18 to 27 percent clay, do not have cambic horizons and are on floodplains.  The Hunting soils lack mottles, do not have redoximorphic features above 20 inches but have mottles at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Ravola soils lack mottles, do not have redoximorphic features throughout the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; low runoff; moderately slow or slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture.  Present vegetation is rushes, sedges and wiregrass.  Potential vegetation is tufted hair grass, red top and clover.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern and central Utah; MLRA 34B.  The series is inextensive.

Remarks:

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by Utah State University lab samples U59258-U59263, profile no. 855.  Hutchings et.al., 1967, Chemical and Physical Properties of the Soils of Carbon-Emery Area, Utah.

Gypsic horizon: The zone from 17 to 33 inches. (y horizons)
Gleyed horizon: the zone from 11 to 70 inches. (g horizons)
  This is a redefinition of Rafael series.  The site location was changed in a previous revision dated 04/1999. and a change in site location.
  The classification was changed from Typic Endoaquepts to Typic Halaquepts, 3/2008; the SAR of the Byg horizon is greater than 13.

  All pH determinations were made of soil paste.
