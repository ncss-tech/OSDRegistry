REXFORD SERIES

The Rexford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained to poorly drained soils on terraces and moraines.  They formed in glacial outwash or stream terraces derived mainly from sandstone and shale.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to low. Mean annual precipitation is 1050 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aeric Fragiaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rexford silt loam-cultivated.  (Colors are for moist soil.)

    Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; 10 percent rock fragments; slightly acid, abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 centimeters thick)

    Bw--20 to 30 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; common fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in matrix; 10 percent rock fragments; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Bg--30 to 43 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron-manganese accumulations; 10 percent rock fragments; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 centimeters thick)

    Bx1--43 to 76 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam; moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and thick platy; very firm, brittle, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few faint clay films in pores; many fine distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; many fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron-manganses accumulations; 25 percent rock fragments; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (20 to 51 centimeters thick)

    Bx2--76 to 96 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly loam; moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate thick platy and weak fine subangular blocky; very firm, brittle, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; very few faint clay films in pores; many coarse prominent light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; many coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) iron-manganese accumulations; 15 percent rock fragments; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 30 centimeters thick)

    C1--96 to 112 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam; massive; firm, nonsticky, nonplastic; 40 percent gravel; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 76 centimeters thick)

    C2--112 to 150 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) stratified sand and gravel; single grain; loose; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Tioga County, Pennsylvania; Covington Township, about 3 1/2 miles south of Mansfield, about 0.4 miles east of intersection of PA 660 and US 15.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 125 centimeters.  Depth to bedrock is greater than than 150 centimeters.  Depth to stratified sand and gravel ranges from 76 to 180 centimeters.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 38 to 60 centimeters.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 40 percent in A, B and Bx horizons and from 15 to 75 percent in the C horizon.  Unlimed, the reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid above the fragipan and from strongly to slightly acid in the C horizon.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth.

The B horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and dominant chromas of 1 or 2, with individual horizons with chroma 3 to 6 and are mottled.  The Bw horizon of some pedons are free of mottling.  The B horizons above the fragipan are sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine-earth.

The Bx horizons have hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  They have both high and low chroma mottles.  They are sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth.  The secondary structure in some pedon is subangular blocky.

The C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth and ranges to stratified sand and gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Morris and Scriba series are in the same family.  The Morris and Scriba soils do not have stratified material within the series control section.

Atherton, Braceville, Erie, Fredon, Halsey, Phelps, Red Hook and Volusia series are in related families.  Atherton, Fredon, Halsey, Phelps and Red Hook soils do not have fragipans.  Braceville soils do not have dominant chroma of 2 or less on ped faces within a depth of 50 centimeters.  The Erie and Volusia soils have more than 18 percent clay within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rexford soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping glacial outwash or stream terraces and water sorted moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The soils developed in water sorted materials derived largely from gray sandstone and shale.  Climate is humid temperature with mean annual precipitation of 900 to 1280 millimeters; mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.5 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season ranges from 140 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Atherton, Braceville, Fredon, Halsey, Phelps, Red Hook, Alton, Chenango, Howard and Tunkhannock soils are formed in glacial outwash and the Barbour, Pope and Tioga soils are on nearby floodplains.  None of these soils have fragipans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained to poorly drained.  Runoff is slow to medium; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cleared and used for hay and grain crops and pasture.  Smaller areas are woodlands with stands dominantly of mixed northern hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Glaciated portions of Pennsylvania. MLRA's 139 and 140. The series is of moderate extent.
