ROMBO SERIES

The Rombo series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed from colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from shale.  Rombo soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rombo cobbly silty clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) cobbly silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine pores; 15 percent angular gravel, cobbles, and stones; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 20 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) cobbly silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine pores; 25 percent angular gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk--20 to 30 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) cobbly clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 25 percent angular gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; common masses and coatings of lime on undersides of coarse fragments; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

    2Cr--30 to 40 inches; soft shale with thin irregular bands of carbonaceous material.

TYPE LOCATION:  Colfax County, New Mexico; about 12 miles west of Raton, New Mexico, 3.8 miles up Potato Canyon from the junction of Potato Canyon Road with Canadian River Road and 160 feet northwest up a south-facing slope from the junction of a small drainage from the northwest with the Potato Canyon drainage; latitude 36 degrees, 53 minutes, and 03 seconds N., longitude 104 degrees, 38 minutes, and 45 seconds W.;

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section in spring and summer. Ustic moisture regime, typic subclass.
Mean annual soil temperature:  43 to 47 degrees F.
Depth to paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches
Rock fragment content:  15 to 50 percent on the surface, 10 to 30 percent on a weighted average in the particle-size control section.
Reaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline

A horizon:  
Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: clay, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.

Bw horizon:  
Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4
Texture:  silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay 
Clay content:  35 to 50 percent

Bk horizon:  
Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4
Texture:  silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay 
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  3 to 10 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Goemmer(CO) series.  
Goemmer soils: have hues redder than 10YR and do not have horizons with calcium carbonate accumulations.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: steep and very steep stony and bouldery convex mountain slopes and hills . 
Parent material:  stony colluvium and alluvium from shale; typically of the Raton Formation.
Elevations range from 7,000 to 9,000 feet. 
Slopes:  3 to 60 percent
The climate is continental. 
Mean annual temperature:  40 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F. 
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 23 inches
Frost free period: 70 to 100 days,  80 to 100 days in the Rio Arriba Area.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dargol and Midnight soils.  Dargol soils have argillic horizons over bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Midnight soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high or very high runoffhigh runoffvery high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wildlife, recreation, and limited use for range.  Gambel's oak, mountain mahogany, twoneedle pinyon, oneseed juniper, blue grama, sideoats grama, little bluestem, and big bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA's 48A and 49. This series is moderately extensive.
