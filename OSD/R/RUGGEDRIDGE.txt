RUGGEDRIDGE SERIES

The Ruggedridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 100 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Medial-skeletal, ferrihydritic, frigid Typic Hapludands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ruggedridge extremely gravelly medial sandy loam-forestland, on a 78 percent south-southwesterly aspect at an elevation of 2,410 feet in a western hemlock/salal plant association.  (When described on August 24, 1996, the soil was moist throughout.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.  All textures are apparent field textures.)

	Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

	Oe--2 to 3 inches; moderately decomposed organic materials; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0.5 to 2 inches thick)

	A--3 to 8 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; weakly smeary; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 70 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches)

	Bw1--8 to 14 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak very fine and fine granular and weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weakly smeary; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.

	Bw2--14 to 28 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) extremely gravelly medial fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak very fine and fine granular and weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weakly smeary; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 18 to 34 inches.)

	R--28 inches, hard metasedimentary rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Clallam County, Washington, about 3.5 miles southeast of Kloshe Nanich, about 300 feet west and 1230 feet south of the northeast corner of Section 6, T. 29 N., R. 10 W.  (Latitude 48 degrees, 02 minutes, 31 seconds N., Longitude 124 degrees, 01 minutes, 46"W.) seconds 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to bedrock contact had andic soil properties with 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 5 to 20 percent field estimated clay and 40 to 60 percent sand.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.

The A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2, 4, or 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4, 6, or 7 dry, chroma of 4 through 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial fine sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial fine sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Duckabush, Fricaba, Gunderson, Lotloh, Maidenpeak and Halfoss series.  Duckabush, Lotloh and Maidenpeak soils are over 40 inches deep.  Fricaba soils are derived from basalt and have less sand in the particle-size control section.  Gunderson soils are deep to dense glacial till.  Halfoss soils are derived from basalt and are dry 30 to 45 consecutive days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ruggedridge soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 100 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 1700 to 2800 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 90 to 100 inches.  Average annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free section is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Gunderson, and Lotloh soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Native vegetation is western hemlock, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, salal, western swordfern, Oregon oxalis, red huckleberry, threeleaf foamflower, deerfoot vanillaleaf, Oregon-grape, princes pine, northern twinflower, rattlesnake plantain, starflower, and deer fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Clallam County, Washington; MLRA 1.  Series is of small extent.
