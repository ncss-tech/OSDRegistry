ROBBSCREEK SERIES

The Robbscreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent in foothills and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Robbscreek fine gravelly coarse sandy loam -- on a 25 percent convex south-facing slope at 4,280 feet elevation in rangeland. When described on July 19, 1994, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(6 to 13 inches thick)

   Bt3--26 to 30 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium and coarse subangular blocky; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

   R--30 inches; unweathered granodiorite.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Robbscreek soils are on hill backslopes, summits and shoulders, canyon walls and butte escarpments at elevations of 2,500 to 5,800 feet. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 22 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brownlee, Cartwright, Dobson, Shimo and Whisk soils. Brownlee and Cartwright soils are greater than 40 inches deep and on similar geomorphic positions. Dobson and Whisk soils are shallow and on summits, shoulders and more convex backslopes. Shimo soils are sandy-skeletal and on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Robbscreek soils are used mainly for rangeland. Small areas are used for irrigated hayland/pasture. Native vegetation is xeric big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 10. Robbscreek soils are of moderate extent.
