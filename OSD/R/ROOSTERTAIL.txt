ROOSTERTAIL SERIES

The Roostertail series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in  eolian deposits from granitoid and/or metamorphic rocks over alluvium from granitoid and/or metamorphic rocks. Roostertail soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roostertail soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in eolian deposits from granitoid and/or metamorphic rocks over alluvium from granitoid and/or metamorphic rocks. Elevations range from 150 to 385 meters (492 to 1,263 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, dry winters. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 100 millimeters (2 to 4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 to 26 degrees C (73.5 to 79 degrees F). The frost-free season is 360 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deprave, Kenalduma, Rizzo and Rockhound soils. Deprave, Kenalduma and Rockhound soils are on similar landscape positions. Deprave and Kenalduma soils have a duripan with an upper boundary between 50 and 100 and 18 and 50 centimeters from the soil surface, respectively. Rockhound soils have an argillic horizon and do not have a duripan. Rizzo soils are in adjacent washes, inset fans and fan aprons and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and no diagnostic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low or low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above and within the argillic horizon and moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity within the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Roostertail soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly very sparse creosote bush, iron wood, palo verde and burrobush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Colorado Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 31. These soils are of small extent.
