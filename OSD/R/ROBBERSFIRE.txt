ROBBERSFIRE SERIES

The Robbersfire series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Robbersfire soils are on back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Calcic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Robbersfire very gravelly silt loam, forest and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 45 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones. Additionally, 30 percent of the soil surface is covered by duff.

(Combined thickness of the Bk2 and Bk3 horizons is 30 to 47 inches.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Robbersfire soils are on back slopes of mountains. These soils formed in colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 7,500 to 9,700 feet. The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and common late summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches; mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 50 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Maryjane, Mountmummy, Ladyofsnow and Thesisters soils. Maryjane soils are located at lower elevations and are dominated by ponderosa pine. Mountmummy and Ladyofsnow soils are at higher elevations and are dominated by Great Basin bristlecone pine. Thesisters soils are shallow and less productive ponderosa pine sites. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for forest and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly white fir, Great Basin bristlecone pine, and currant. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are moderately extensive.
