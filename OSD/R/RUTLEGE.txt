    Cg2--35 to 70 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots in upper part; tends to flow when saturated; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Marion County, South Carolina; 1.25 miles north of Nichols and 500 feet east of S. C. Highway 9 .

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 6 inches, December to May
Soil Reaction: extremely acid to strongly acid, except where limed
Other Features: Silt plus clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section averages 5 to 15 percent 

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand and their mucky analogues 

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand 
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)-- have value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6

COMPETING SERIES:
Cadelake soils - have Bg horizons and on average have less organic matter in the umbric epipedon

  There are no other known series in the same family.  The Dawhoo, Johnston, Osier, Pickney, Plummer, Lynn Haven, Scarboro, and Torhunta series are similar soils in related families.  Dawhoo soils have mixed mineralogy.  Johnston and Pickney soils have umbric epipedons that are more than 24 inches thick.  Osier and Plummer soils do not have an umbric epipedon.  The Lynn Haven soils have spodic horizons. Scarboro soils have average annual soil temperatures of 47 to 59 degrees F.  Torhunta soils have sandy loam or fine sandy loam texture in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: upland flats or depressions, flood plains
Geomorphic Component: talfs, dips, treads
Parent Material: marine or fluvial sediments

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage Class (Agricultural): very poorly drained
Internal Free Water Occurrence: very shallow, persistent
Index Surface Runoff: negligible, ponding is common in depressional areas 
Permeability: rapid

USE AND VEGETATION:
  Major Uses: truck crops, forest
  Dominant Vegetation: Where cultivated-- for corn, soybeans, blueberries, hay and pasture.  Where wooded--blackgum, Carolina ash, red maple, sweetbay, tulip popular, water oak, pin oak, pond pine, slash pine, and loblolly pine.  The understory is huckleberry, wax myrtle, greenbriar, grasses and sedges.  Some ponded areas consist of entirely grasses and sedges.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Camburton Soil Conservation District, New Jersey, 1943.

REMARKS:  This revision changes the type location from Maryland to South Carolina to meet the temperature requirements for thermic.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

 Umbric epipedon--The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (A horizon).
