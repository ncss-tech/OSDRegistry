ROMINELL SERIES

The Rominell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Leptic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rominell loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots throughout horizon; common fine tubular pores; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    E--4 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots throughout horizon; many fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Btn--9 to 15 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; strong medium columnar structure parting to strong medium angular blocky, very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine roots throughout horizon; many fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; many distinct light gray (2.5Y 7/2) skeletans on tops and sides of columns; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bnyz--15 to 25 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots throughout horizon; common to many fine tubular pores; few light gray (2.5Y 7/2) skeletans on vertical faces of peds; few fine gypsum crystals; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 13 inches thick)

    Byz--25 to 55 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few to common fine roots throughout horizon; common fine tubular pores; few fine gypsum crystals; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 29 inches thick)

    C-55 to 61 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots throughout horizon; common fine tubular pores; few hard rock fragments; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2).
