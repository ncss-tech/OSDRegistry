RAINSBORO SERIES

The Rainsboro series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed
in loess and the underlying weathered Illinoian outwash deposits on high
terraces.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the loess, moderately
slow or slow in the fragipan, and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying
material.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is
about 39 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ava series.  Ava soils contain less than 5 percent
sand in the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rainsboro soils formed in loess and the underlying weathered
Illinoian outwash deposits on risers and treads on high stream terraces in areas
of Illinoian glaciation or in areas which have valleys that have carried
Illinoian outwash.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  Climate is
humid and temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 43 inches, and
mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 55 degrees F.  Frost free days range
from 145 to 181 days, and elevation ranges from 600 feet to 940 feet above sea
level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alford, Libre, Negley, Parke,
Pike, Taggart, and Teegarden (T) soils.  The well drained Alford, Parke and Pike
do not have a fragipan and are on similar landforms.  Moderately well drained
Libre soils do not have a fragipan and are on similar landforms.  The well
drained Negley soils and are on steeper terrace risers.  Taggart and Teegarden
(T) soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  The potential for surface
runoff is negligible to high.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in
the loess, moderately slow or slow in the fragipan, and moderate or moderately
rapid in the underlying material.  Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high
water table is at 2.0 to 3.5 feet from January through April in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: More than half of the Rainsboro soils are used for
cultivated crops.  Corn, soybeans, wheat, and mixed hay are the principal
crops.  A few areas are in pasture or woodland.  Native vegetation was mixed,
deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern and eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.
The series is of moderate extent.  MLRA's 114, 124, 126, and 139.
