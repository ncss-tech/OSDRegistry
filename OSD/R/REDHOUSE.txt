REDHOUSE SERIES

The Redhouse series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Redhouse soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces, and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Redhouse fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated).
 A--0 to 5 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine platy structure; loose, very friable; few very fine and medium roots; few medium pores; moderately calcareous; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)
 Bw1--5 to l3 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; moderately calcareous; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)
 Bw2--l3 to 24 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; l5 percent gravel; moderately calcareous; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)
 Bw3--24 to 34 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; 5 percent cobbles; 25 percent gravel; moderately calcareous; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)
 Bk1--34 to 56 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy clay loam; red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly calcareous; carbonates are disseminated and segregated as filaments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 24 inches thick)
 Bk2--56 to 68 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately calcareous; carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Avalon (CO), Kilroy (UT), Pariette (UT), and Siltcliffe (T)(UT) series. Avalon series have hue of 10YR or yellower and liss than 15 percent rock fragments. Kilroy soils have hue 7.5YR and yellower. Panaker soils have hue of 10YR. Pariette series have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and soil temperatures less than 50 degrees F. Siltcliffe soils have calcic horizon above 20 inches, less than 15 percent rock fragments, and a 10YR hue.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redhouse soils occur on alluvial fans or fan terraces at elevations of 3,700 to 6,400 feet. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 150 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Moenkopie and Nakai soils. Moenkopie soils are less than 20 inches deep to sandstone. Nakai soils are sandy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is dominantly shadscale, galleta, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Utah. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 35.
