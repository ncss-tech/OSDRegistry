RALORE SERIES

The Ralore series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Aridic Leptic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ralore clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure parting to weak fine angular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Btn--2 to 7 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.1); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Btkn--7 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; disseminated lime, common fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.1); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Byz--12 to 16 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR5/2) moist; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; roots matted at the contact with the Cr horizon; few very fine pores; 10 percent soft shale fragments; few fine masses of gypsum and other salts; disseminated lime; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches)

    Cr--16 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) semiconsolidated shale that crushes to silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).
