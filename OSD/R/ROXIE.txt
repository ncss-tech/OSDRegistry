ROXIE SERIES

The Roxie series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metamorphic rock. The Roxie soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Roxie gravelly sandy loam, on a northeast facing, 25 percent slope under rangeland at an elevation of 1248 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. 1/9/2013 actual site observation date.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 20 percent fine gravel, 40 percent medium and coarse gravel, 5 percent cobbles.

(Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 25 to 40 centimeters, 10 to 16 inches thick.)

     BCt--27 to 65 cm (11 to 26 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; massive; moderately hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots in cracks; common fine irregular pores; 20 percent faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on rock fragments; 10 percent fine gravel, 60 percent medium and coarse gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

     Cr--65 to 90 cm (26 to 35 inches); weakly coherent gneiss bedrock (fractures 10 to <45 cm apart); massive; weakly coherent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashmed (NV), Bitter (CA), Blind (AZ), Bluebird (AZ), Highland (NV), Khyber (CA), Nellake (CA), Soledad (NM), Tiefort (CA), Timosea (CA), Topawa (AZ), Twobitter (CA), Werewolf (CA) and Yuccabutte (CA) series. Ashmed, Bitter, Blind, Bluebird, Khyber, Nellake, Soledad, Timosea, Topawa, Twobitter, Werewolf and Yuccabutte soils are all very deep soils and do not have a paralithic contact within 150 centimeters. Highland and Tiefort soils have a lithic contact between 75 to 100 and 50 to 75 centimeters respectively and formed in volcanic parent materisl. Ashmed, Bitter, Blind, Bluebird, Highland, Kyber, Tiefort, Timosea, Topawa, and Yuccabutte soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Nellake and Yuccabutte soils have MAST of 19 to 22 degrees C. Topawa soils have MAST of 20 to 22 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Roxie soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metamorphic rock. Elevation ranges from 1050 to 1600 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is about 13 to 17 degrees C. The frost-free period is 210 to 320 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coppermine and Copperworld series. Coppermine soils are on backslopes of hills and mountains and is shallow to hard bedrock. Copperworld soils are on backslopes of hills and mountains, has a loamy control section, and is shallow to hard bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: well drained; high runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the bedrock and very low saturated hydraulic conductivity within the bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Roxie soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is California buckwheat, Cooper's goldenbush, Mojave yucca and white ratany.
