ROCKY FORD SERIES

The Rocky Ford series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium Rocky Ford soils are on terraces. The surface horizon formed in clayey alluvium from sediment-rich irrigation water. The subsoil and substratum formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary materials. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Prowers County, Colorado 1963.

REMARKS:  OSD scanned by NSSQA.  Last revised on 10/2013.
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Series control section: 0 to 200 centimeters
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches).
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches). (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)
Calcic horizon: 46 to 89 centimeters (18 to 35 inches). (Bk1 horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

LAN 3/2013 The previous classification of calcareous Ustic Torriorthents became obsolete following a field project that indicated soils in the area had mollic epipedons.  As a result of this update, the type location has been moved from from Prowers County, Colorado to Otero County, Colorado and taxonomic class changes to Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls.
