RENBAC SERIES

The Renbac series consists of soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on ridges and mesa slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Renbac very channery clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very channery clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak thin and medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, plastic; many very fine vesicular pores; 45 percent rock fragments; slightly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    Bw--1 to 2 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) channery clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; strong fine and very fine granular structure; soft, friable, sticky, plastic; few fine roots; common fine and many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent rock fragments; slightly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 5 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very channery clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine and very fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky very plastic; few fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 55 percent rock fragments; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; noncalcareous; moderately alkaline. (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--5 to 9 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very channery clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine and very fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 60 percent rock fragments; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; moderately calcareous, lime is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk--9 to 12 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely flaggy sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 80 percent rock fragments; moderately calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt irregular boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    R--12 inches; sandstone bedrock, somewhat weathered

TYPE LOCATION:  Washington County, Utah; about 1 1/2 miles southwest of Ivins; about 480 feet south and 500 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 12, T.42s., R.17W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 75 to 85 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F unless irrigated.

Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from - 59 to 67 degrees F.,

Mean summer soil temperature ranges from - 77 to 82 degrees F.

Depth to bedrock ranges from - 8 to 17 inches.

Reaction  - range from slightly to strongly alkaline.  


A horizon  

Chroma:  2 to 5

Rock fragments: 40 to 70 percent 


Bt horizon 

Value:  4 or 5 dry 

Chroma:  4 to 6

Texture: very channery clay to very gravelly clay or very channery clay loam 

Rock fragments:  25 to 75 percent

Effervescence: ranges from noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Renbac soils are on ridges and mesa slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, conglomerate, and shale.  The mean annual temperature is 57 to 65 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F.   The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  The frost-free period is 190 to 195 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hobog soils. Hobog soils have very flaggy loam control sections, have calcic horizons, and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland.  Potential vegetation consists of blackrush, Mormon tea, bursage, and creosotebush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Utah and northern Arizona.  The series is inextensive.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Argillic horizon - the zone from 2 to 9 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Lithic contact - Sandstone bedrock at 12 inches (R)
