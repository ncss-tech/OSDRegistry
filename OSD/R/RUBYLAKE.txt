RUBYLAKE SERIES

The Rubylake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Rubylake soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rubylake soils are on lake terraces.  These soils formed in loess and alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kolda and Wendane soils.  Kolda soils are fine textured, have mollic epipedons, and are very poorly drained.  Wendane soils are fine-silty, are influenced by volcanic ash, and have sodium adsorption ratio of more than 13 in the upper 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability (moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 30 and 60 cm (shallow or moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between March and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rubylake soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly inland saltgrass, western wheatgrass, sedge, and Juncus sp.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 3,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Elko County, Nevada, Southeast Part, 1994.  The name is coined from Ruby Lake.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 18 to 58 cm (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).
Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 30 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bg1, Bg2, Akgb1, Akgb2, and BCkg horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 58 to 152 cm (Akgb1, Akgb2, and BCkg horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bg2 horizon and parts of the Bg1 and Akgb1 horizons).

The revision of October 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, carbonatic, mesic Mollic Fluvaquents based on recognition of a cambic horizon.
