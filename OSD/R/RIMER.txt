RIMER SERIES

The Rimer series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep or moderately deep to dense till. These soils formed in sandy glaciolacustrine deposits and in the underlying till. They are on lake plains, wave-worked till plains, till-floored lake plains, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bixler, Leola, Markton, and Selfridge series. Bixler soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Leola soils are more acid than slightly alkaline in the lower part of the series control section. Markton soils have less than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Selfridge soils do not have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rimer soils are on convex surfaces on lake plains, wave-worked till plains, till-floored lake plains, and till plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients commonly are 1 to 4 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in sandy glaciolacustrine deposits and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 182 days. Elevation is 183 to 253 meters (600 to 830 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Tustin soils, moderately well drained Seward soils, and very poorly drained Wauseon soils are in a toposequence with the Rimer soils. Tustin and Seward soils are in higher or more sloping topographic positions. Wauseon soils are on broad, nearly level areas or in depressions. On wave-worked till plains, Ziegenfuss soils are associated with Rimer soils.  Ziegenfuss soils are on broad, nearly level areas or in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very high in the sandy material, moderately low in the lower part of the subsoil, and low in the substratum. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material, slow in the lower part of the subsoil, and slow or very slow in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Rimer soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow are the principal crops. A small proportion is used for pasture or is in woodland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest with beech, elm, hickory, maple, and oaks as principal species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Primarily in MLRA 99 but also in MLRAs 97, 98, 111B, and 139 in northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan. It has been correlated in MLRAs 95A, 95B, 89, and 105 in Wisconsin and MLRA 139 in Pennsylvania. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Putnam County, Ohio, 1930.

REMARKS: The previous Rimer series concept allowed loamy surface phases, a deep (to till) phase, a stratified substratum phase, and fine-textured lacustrine sediments in the 2B and 2C horizons. New series will be established to address these soils during modernization projects in MLRA 99.

An evaluation of existing lab data supports the redefinition of clay content in the till. More study is needed to differentiate the Rimer series concept from the Selfridge series.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence of densic materials in the 2Cd horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 58 cm (Ap, E horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 58 to 102 cm (Bt, 2Btg, 2Bt horizons).
Densic contact: at 137 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: iron depletions in all horizons below a depth of 58 cm.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for pedons HN-1, PD-43, WD-64, WD-65, and WD-80. This data should be evaluated in the future to determine if it supports the current series concept.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 130039 in MO 11.
