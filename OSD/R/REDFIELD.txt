REDFIELD SERIES

The Redfield series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and shale. Redfield soils occur on alluvial fans, basin floors, alluvial flats, fan skirts and valley plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, carbonatic, mesic Xeric Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Redfield silt loam--irrigated cropland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--O to 15 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) silt loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine and medium pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    C1--15 to 48 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) silt loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist massive slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine and medium pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 75 cm thick)

    C2--48 to 55 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; common fine and medium pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

    C3--55 to 150 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) silt loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine and medium pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION: Sevier County, Utah; 2.5 miles west and 1/4 mile south of Sigurd; 2,160 feet east, 2,270 feet north of the SW corner of section 3, T.23S., R.2W.; USGS Richfield 7.5 minute quadrangle; lat. 38 degrees 49 minutes 48 seconds N. and long. 112 degrees 0 minutes 32 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime. 
Some pedons have a seasonal irrigation induced water table at 100 to 152 cm from May to September.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature: 15.5 to 22 degrees C 
Organic matter content: Either decreases irregularly with depth, or remains above 0.35 percent to a depth of 125 cm 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 60 percent

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.
Sand content: Less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.

A horizon
Hue: 5YR or 2.5YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 6 moist.

C horizon 
Hue: 5YR or 2.5YR.
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 3 to 6.
Texture: Silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in individual strata.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Naser, Quaker, and Redview series. 

Naser and Quaker soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. Quaker and Redview soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redfield soils are at elevations of 1,570 to 1,860 meters. They occur on alluvial fans, fan skirts, basin floors, alluvial flats and valley plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and shale. The climate is semiarid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 8 to 10.5 degrees C. The mean summer temperature is 19.5 to 20.5 degrees C., and the frost free period ranges from 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Naser, Quaker, Redview soils and the Vanajo soils that have 35 to 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well and moderately well drained; slow and medium runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for growing irrigated crops of alfalfa, small grain, corn, sugar beets and pasture. Native vegetation is shadscale, big sagebrush, horsebrush and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sevier and Iron Counties Utah; MLRA 47, 28A; these soils are of moderate extent.
