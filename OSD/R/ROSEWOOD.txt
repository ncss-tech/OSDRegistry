ROSEWOOD SERIES

The Rosewood series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous sandy lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains. These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part. Slopes typically range from 0 to 2 percent, but range to 5 percent in areas with side hill seeps. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 53 centimeters. 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Calciaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Rosewood fine sandy loam with a nearly level concave slope on a glacial lake plain in a cultivated field at an elevation of 334 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated) 

 Ap--0 to 20 cm; black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; about 2 percent gravel; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 41 centimeters thick) 

 Bkg1--20 to 28 cm; gray (5Y 5/1) fine sandy loam; common medium prominent light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) and common medium distinct dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) redoximorphic concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; about 2 percent gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. 

 Bkg2--28 to 46 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) fine sandy loam; few medium distinct light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) redoximorphic concentrations; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 2 percent gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined Bk horizons 15 to 36 centimeters thick) 

 Cg1--46 to 58 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sand; many medium prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) redoximorphic concentrations; single grain; loose; about 5 percent gravel; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

 Cg2--58 to 119 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sand; common coarse prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; single grain; loose; about 2 percent gravel; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. 

 Cg3--119 to 200 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sand; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and many coarse prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) redoximorphic concentrations; single grain; loose; about 5 percent gravel; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Pennington County, Minnesota; about 5 km north and 5 km west of St. Hilaire; 107 meters north and 305 meters west of the southeast corner of sec. 27, T. 153 N., R. 44 W. USGS Viking SE, MN quadrangle Lat. 48 degrees 02 minutes 05 seconds N. Long. 96 degrees 16 minutes 45 seconds W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:                                                                                       Thickness of mollic epipedon - 18 to 41 cm
Thickness of coarse-loamy mantle - less than 50 cm
Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline throughout
Calcic horizon - upper boundary within 26 centimeters of the surface
Rock fragments in the control section - less than 10 percent, but some strata 10 cm or less have as much as 25% below the coarse-loamy mantle that are less than 5 mm in size
Saline phases recognized

Ap and A horizons:
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 2 or 3
Chroma - 0 or 2
Texture - fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or sandy loam 

Bk horizon:
Hue - 10YR to 5Y
Value - 4 to 6
Chroma - 1 or 2
Texture - fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or fine sand 
Redoximorphic features - distinct or prominent present in the lower part of the Bk horizon

Cg horizons:
Hue - 2.5Y or 5Y
Value - 4 to 7
Chroma - 1 or 2 
Texture - fine earth fraction typically is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand but ranges to loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the upper part 
Redoximorphic features - distinct or prominent 
Some pedons have strata of loamy very fine sand, silt loam, silty clay and silty clay loam below a depth of 102 centimeters 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Syrene soils. Syrene soils have 10 to 35 percent of rock fragments in the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - linear or concave slopes on glacial lake plains
Parent material - calcareous sandy lacustrine or outwash sediments of late Wisconsinan age
Slope - 0 to 2 percent, ranges to 5 percent in areas with side hill seeps
Elevation - 244 to 412 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature - 3 to 6 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation - 48 to 61 centimeters
Frost-free period - 88 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Borup, Deerwood, Hamar, Strathcona, Thiefriver and Ulen soils. 
Borup - are coarse-silty throughout the series control section 
Deerwood - are in depressions and have histic epipedons
Ulen - are on higher, better drained positions
Strathcona and Thiefriver - have an underlying layer of loamy or clayey glacial till
Hamar - do not have a calcic horizon
Garborg - slightly higher landscape position and lacks a calcic horizon within 40 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class - poorly drained and very poorly drained
Runoff - negligible or very low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid in the lower part Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table - high as 6 to 46 cm at some time from April to June in most years for the poorly drained phase and 0.0 to 30cm at some time from January through December for the very poorly drained (wet phase) and depressional phase

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are cultivated. Small grains, sunflowers, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Physiographic Division-Interior Plains
Physiographic Province-Central Lowland
Physiographic section-Western Lake section
