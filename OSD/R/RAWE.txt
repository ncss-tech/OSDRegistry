RAWE SERIES

The Rawe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Rawe soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rawe soils are on fan remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 1,730 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delp, Isolde, Pizene, and Sutcliff soils.  Delp soils are coarse-loamy, have an argillic horizon composed of lamellae, and occur on stable dunes. Isolde soils are sandy, have an ochric epipedon, and occur on stable dunes. Pizene soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons, and occur on adjacent fan remnants. Sutcliff soils are loamy-skeletal, deep to a duripan, and occur on adjacent fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow permeability in the subsoil; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity and moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the strongly contrasting substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rawe soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is shadscale, bud sagebrush, Bailey's greasewood, Indian ricegrass, and scattered spiny hopsage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and northern Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. They occur dominantly in MLRA 27, but have also been mapped in MLRAs 24, 25, and 26.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 3 cm (A horizon).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 25 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 18 to 152 cm (Btk, 2Bk1, and 2Bk2 horizons).
Major lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to loamy-skeletal material at 25 cm (between the Btk and 2Bk1 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 3 to 100 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Btk, and 2Bk1 horizons and the upper part of the 2Bk2 horizon).
