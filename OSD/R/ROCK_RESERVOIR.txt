ROCK RESERVOIR SERIES

The Rock Reservoir series consist of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes are from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Rock reservoir sandy loam, 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,439 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A1--0 to 12 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots throughout; few very fine vesicular pores; 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

   AC--12 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout, few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

   C1--18 to 26 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout, few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent fine 7.5YR 6/6 oxidized iron masses; 2 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. 

   C2--26 to 52 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic, few very fine roots throughout; 3 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses, 10 percent fine 2.5Y 6/1 iron depletions; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of C1 and C2 horizons is 20 to 60 cm)

   C3--52 to 200 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic, 2 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses, 20 percent fine 2.5Y 6/1 iron depletions; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.
