ROBINLEE SERIES

The Robinlee series consists of very deep, well drained soils on nearly level to undulating moraines.  They formed in glacial drift influenced by loess.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Robinlee silt loam, on a cultivated southwest facing concave slope of 3 percent.  Elevation is 5590 feet.  The soil was moist throughout when described on August 2, 1984.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 11 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 1 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    BA--11 to 23 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 1 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt--23 to 41 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; few krotovinas; about 3 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

    Bky1--41 to 52 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; about 2 percent pebbles; a 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, brittle, weakly cemented layer at the bottom of the horizon; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear broken boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bky2--52 to 63 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine tubular pores; many fine gypsiferous filaments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in this family.  Soils in a closely related family are the Clegg, Despain, Gross and Lize series.  They have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and lack secondary gypsum accumulations.  Despain and Lize soils have 20 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Gross soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Robinlee soils are on nearly level to gently sloping moraines at elevations of 5250 to 5650 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  They formed in glacial drift influenced by loess.  The average annual air temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  The frost-free season is 75

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Kucera, Lostine, Marystown, Rexburg and Rin soils.  These soils occur on adjacent slopes in loess and glacial till.  Kucera, Lostine, Rexburg and Rin soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Kucera, Lostine and Rexburg soils lack Bt horizons.  Marystown, Rin and Lostine soils lack secondary carbonates.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Robinlee soils are cultivated.  The major crops are:  potatoes, spring barley, and alfalfa hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are inextensive in southeast Idaho.
