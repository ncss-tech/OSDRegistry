ROINE SERIES

The Roine series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils formed in eolian sediments over loamy sediments and glacial till. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Roine fine sandy loam, on a 2 percent slope, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 1,380 feet above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and very dark brown (10YR 2/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; common very fine to medium roots between peds; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 

 A--8 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark brown (10YR 3/3) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; common very fine to medium roots between peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 16 inches.)

(Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 30 to 50 inches.) 

 2Cg1--48 to 52 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; massive; friable; common fine roots; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 3Cg3--59 to 76 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam; massive; firm; common fine and medium rounded yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of iron; few fine rounded very pale brown (10YR 8/2) calcium carbonate nodules; about 3 percent gravel; many fine and medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

 3Cg4--76 to 80 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam; massive; firm; common fine and medium rounded strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron; few medium very dark gray (10YR 3/1) iron-manganese nodules; about 3 percent gravel; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Bertram soils have limestone bedrock within depths of 60 inches.
Dickinson, Filley, Flagler, Ridgeport and Zenor soils do not have glacial till within depths of 60 inches.
Lowlein soils have bulk density of less than 1.6 g/cc in the lower third of the series control section.
Olin soils have loamy glacial till above depths of 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--eolian sediments and loamy sediments over glacial till
Landscape--Glaciated uplands 
Landform--Summits and back slopes

Elevation--1,250 to 1,500 feet above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--45 to 50 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation--26 to 30 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
The moderately well drained Everly and somewhat poorly drained Wilmonton soils do not coarse textured horizons in the series control section. The moderately well drained Ocheyedan and Annieville soils occupy similar positions on the landscape and contain less sand throughout the profile.
The somewhat poorly drained Fostoria soils occur lower on the landscape and are fine-loamy. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--seasonally high saturation occurs between depths of 4 and 6 feet during the wettest portions of normal years
Permeability--moderately rapid
Surface runoff--medium 

USE AND VEGETATION: Commonly used for row crops. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 107, Northwestern Iowa. Roine soils are not extensive

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clay County, Iowa, 2002 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 48 inches (Bw horizons).

This soil was formerly included with the Dickinson, Ocheyedan, and Waukegan soils. 

This soil appears to be a common component of "sand stringers" found along glacial margins. Further studies are needed to determine their extent, as well as the source of the gray silts that occur immediately above the glacial till and below the eolian sand deposits. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: For results of some laboratory analysis refer to Iowa Agriculture Experiment Station file number 95IA041021 for data on the typical pedon, and to Lincoln Laboratory for data on additional pedons.
