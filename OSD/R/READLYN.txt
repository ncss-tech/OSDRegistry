READLYN SERIES

The Readlyn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying till. Readlyn soils are on slightly convex side slopes on dissected till plains of low relief on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.3 to 1.0 meter during April to June in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered and both perched and apparent saturation can occur on this soil based on the season and intensity of rainfall during a given period of time
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10.0 micrometers per second in the loamy sediments and 0.01 to 1.0 micrometers per second in the underlying till

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (A1, A2, and BA horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 117 centimeters (Bw, 2Bg1 and 2Bg2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Aquic subgroup--matrix hue of 10YR and chroma of 2 in the zone from a depth of 48 to 61 centimeters (Bw horizon).

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data from NSSL. 

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.
