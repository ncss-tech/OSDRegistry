ROCKBOUND SERIES


The Rockbound series consists of shallow and very shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in glacial drift, slope alluvium and colluvium derived predominantly from granodiorite.  Due to glaciation some areas have a mix of rock types.  The Rockbound soils are on glacial-valley floors and walls in the mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1499 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Lithic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Rockbound very gravelly loamy sand on an east facing (100 degree), 15 percent slope at an elevation of 2134 meters. When described on 06/18/2002 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

	A--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loamy sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) rubbed moist; weak fine granular structure; many very fine roots throughout; 35 percent gravel; moderately acid, pH 5.8. (10 to 20 cm thick)

	Bw--15 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) rubbed moist; weak fine granular structure; many very fine roots throughout; 35 percent gravel; moderately acid, pH 5.8. (8 to 30 cm thick) 

	R--20 cm; Indurated granodiorite bedrock;

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Soil moisture: usually moist but are dry in all parts from mid-July until early October.  The soils have a xeric moisture regime.

Depth to lithic contact: 18 to 50 cm

Surface rock fragment content:
  20 to 60 percent consisting of: 5 to 25 percent boulders, 5 to 20 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, 5 to 30 percent stones

Reaction: strongly to slightly acid

Control section: the entire soil minus any organic material on the surface.

Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, with 35 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent cobbles, 0 to 50 percent stones and 0 to 50 percent boulders.

Clay content: averages 3 to 12 percent clay

Mineralogy: mixed

A horizon:
  Hue: 10YR
  Value: 3 through 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist
  Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rockbound soils are on glacial valley floors and walls. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in drift and slope alluvium derived predominantly from granodiorite.  Elevation is 1910 to 2830 meters. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 940 to 1650 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost free season is 50 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glenalpine and Dagget soils. The Dagget soils are deep to and have a more closed canopy of trees and the Glenalpine soils are deep predominantly from volcanic materials.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained, moderately rapid permeability above the bedrock, very high runoff, no flooding or ponding

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife and recreation.  Vegetation is sparse conifers such as sierra juniper and Jeffrey pine and shrubs huckleberry oak and green leaf manzanita.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Rockbound is of moderate extent in California in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains
