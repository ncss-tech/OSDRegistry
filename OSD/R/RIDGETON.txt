RIDGETON SERIES

The Ridgeton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy local colluvium which may overlay till. These soils are on side slopes and base slopes on moraines or non-glaciated uplands and on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 6 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Hapludolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy local colluvium which may overlay till
Landform--side slopes and base slopes on moraines or non-glaciated uplands and on treads and risers on stream terraces
Slope--6 to 45 percent
Elevation--200 to 400 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 10 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--585 to 965 millimeters
Frost-free period--145 to 205 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clarion, Delft, Lester, Storden and Terril soils.
Clarion--are on higher landscape positions on uplands and have a mollic epipedon 25 to 50 centimeters thick
Delft--are on lower landscape positions on base slopes and are frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest periods of normal years
Lester--are on higher landscape positions on uplands and have an argillic horizon
Storden--are on higher landscape positions on uplands and have carbonates within a depth of 25 centimeters
Terril--are on lower landscape positions on base slopes and have a frequently saturated zone at a depth of 1 meter during the wettest periods of normal years

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--well drained--a frequently saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second 

USE AND VEGETATION:
More steeply sloping areas are non-cropped escarpments, either in woods or permanent pasture. More gently sloping areas are cultivated. The principal corps are corn, soybeans, and small grain. The native vegetation is mixed big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, other grasses of the tall grass prairie and scattered hardwood trees on steep escarpments along river valleys.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic Section--Western lake section, Wisconsin driftless section, and Dissected till plains
MLRAs--Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (103),
 Eastern Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (104), and
 Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills (105)
LRR M; north-central and northwestern Iowa, and southern Minnesota
Extent--small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-5 (Albert Lea, Minnesota) 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Waseca County, Minnesota, 2001. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 97 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, and AB horizons)
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 97 centimeters to 127 centimeters;
udic moisture regime. 

The organic carbon content at a depth of 125 centimeters is less than 0.3 percent.

A firm till substratum phase is recognized on the Coteau Slope in MLRA 103.

This series replaces the Terril soils, where correlated on steeper slopes, as the concept of Terril has changed to moderately well drained with saturation in the lower third of the series controls section. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
