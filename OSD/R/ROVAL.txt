ROVAL SERIES

Roval series consists of shallow to a duripan, well-drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine sediments. Roval soils are on eroded fan remnants.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County (Meadow Valley Area), Nevada, 1971.

REMARKS: In older surveys, Roval soils were formerly classified as Brown soils and later classified as Argiduridic Durixerolls. The type location was moved and the soil reclassified in 2009 to better reflect the soil characteristics of the landscape. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 5 cm (A horizon).
