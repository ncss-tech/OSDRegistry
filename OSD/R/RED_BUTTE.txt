RED BUTTE SERIES

The Red Butte series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks. Red Butte soils are on alluvial and colluvial slopes and rolling hills. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 325 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Red Butte very cobbly loam, rangeland (Colors are for air dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

(20 to 25 cm thick)

    Bk1--41 to 51 cm; white (7.5YR 8/1) cobbly sandy loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) moist; massive; strongly cemented in places, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; no pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Bk2--51 to 152 cm; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) very cobbly sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; weakly cemented in places, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

Value: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4.
Texture: Sandy loam, loam or occasionally clay loam.
Rock fragments: 35 to 65 percent; cobbles and gravel.
Carbonates: Strongly or weakly cemented in places and massive.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Butterfield, Kapod, Schuelke and Tannahill series. 

Butterfield and Schuelke soils are moderately deep.  Kapod soils have calcic horizons below 52 to 83 cm and depth to base of Bt horizon greater than 52 cm. Tannahill soils are deep to basalt bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Red Butte soils are on alluvial and colluvial slopes, fan remnants and rolling hills at elevations of 1,524 to 2,286 meters. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in intermediate igneous and sedimentary parent rocks. The climate is dry subhumid. Mean annual air temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C., mean summer temperature is about 18 to 19 degrees C., and the average annual precipitation is about 300 to 400 mm. The frost free period is about 90 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deer Creek, Pharo, Flowell and Pass Canyon soils. Deer Creek soils have more than 35 percent clay and a mean annual soil temperature less than 8.5 degrees C. Pharo soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments of gravel size, and do not have Bt horizons. Flowell soils have a fine particle-size class. Pass Canyon soils are less than 52 cm deep over bedrock and do not have horizons of high lime accumulation.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium and high runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for wildlife and spring or summer grazing by sheep and cattle. Present vegetation is juniper, sagebrush, bitterbrush, and Gambel oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountain areas of southwestern Utah. This series is of moderate extent. MLRA 28A.
