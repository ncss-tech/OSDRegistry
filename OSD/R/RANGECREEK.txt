RANGECREEK SERIES

The Rangecreek series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock over residuum from sandstone and shale.  Rangecreek soils are on hills, mountain slopes and structural benches.  Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.3 degrees C.

The Foy and Rabbitex soils are very deep and deep, respectively, have a calcic horizon, and are on lower mountainflanks.  The Rabbitex soils are on north aspects under Wyoming big sagebrush.  The Podo soils have a cambic horizon and a lithic contact and are intermixed with the Rangecreek soils.  The Skein soils have a calcic horizon and are on tops of structural benches.  The Tosca soils have a mollic epipedon and a calcic horizon and are on north aspects at higher elevations under mountain shrubs.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery Area, Utah, 2011, Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand and Sevier Counties soil survey area.  Named for Range Creek, a major drainage in the Book Cliffs near the type location.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 69 cm, which is 25 cm below the paralithic contact.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 44 cm.  (C2 and lower part of C1 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 cm.  (A horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 44 cm.  (Cr horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
