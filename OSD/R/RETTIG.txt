RETTIG SERIES

The Rettig series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in materials from schist and gneiss that are high in mica with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 1,150 mm and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, amorphic over micaceous, frigid Typic Udivitrands

COMPETING SERIES:
Nakarna (ID): are deep to a paralithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rettig soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 485 to 1525 meters. They have slopes of 15 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in materials from schist and gneiss that are high in mica with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. The average annual air temperature is 3.3 to 7.8 degrees C.  The average annual precipitation is 750 to 1525 mm. The frost free season is 50 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bouldercreek, Grandad and Township series. Bouldercreek and Township soils are on mountain slopes and canyons, and are skeletal in the 2Bw horizons. Grandad soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops and have an argillic horizon.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, western hemlock, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch and western white pine with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlily, goldthread, starry false Solomon's seal, oneleaf foamflower and baldhip rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Idaho; Rettig soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A
