Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 978 mm (38.5 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.2 degrees C (66.6 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is Nimrod (TX) series.  Similar soils are the Coving, Chazos, Demona, Nueces, Rader, Rehburg, Selden, Tanglewood (TX-T), and Tremona series.  
Nimrod soils: do not have a Bt/E horizon, receive less effective precipitation and are have a typic/ustic moisture regime.
Coving soils: are moderately acid to slightly alkaline throughout the argillic horizon, and are somewhat poorly drained.    
Chazos soils: are in the fine family, and have surface layers less than 51 cm (20 in) thick.  
Demona, Tanglewood, and Tremona soils: are in the fine family.  
Nueces soils: are in the hyperthermic temperature regime.  
Rader soils: do not have arenic surface layers.  
Rehburg soils: are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) thick over tuffaceous materials.
Selden soils: have surface layers less than 51 cm (20 in) thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy sediments on Pleistocene terrace deposits about 10.7 to 30.5 m (35 to 100 ft) above present streams or local outwash colluvial plains
Landscape: low oval convex ridges, footslopes and concave sideslope positions or near the heads of drainageways
Slope: 0 to 8 percent, but are mostly 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 891 to 1153 mm (35 to 45.4 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Arenosa, Chazos, Hearne, Jedd, Marquez, Padina, Rader, Rosanky,  Silstid, and Tanglewood (T-TX) series.  
Arenosa, Padina, and Silstid soils: are mainly on broad smooth areas in higher better drained positions.  Chazos soils: do not have thick sandy surface layers and are on similar land forms.  
Hearne, Jedd, Rosanky, and Marquez soils: are on higher ridges and side slopes and have a thinner sola.  Rader soils: are slightly lower in the landscape, and have fine sandy loam surface layers.
Tanglewood soils: occur on similar positions but are formed in loamy and clayey residuum derived primarily from claystone and shale of Eocene Age. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Moderately well.  
Permeability class: slow.  
Runoff: low on slopes less than 1 percent, medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and high on 5 to 8 percent slopes.  
Wetness: Water is perched above the argillic horizon during the cool season for short periods following heavy rains.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for pasture and rangeland.  Pastures are improved bermudagrass or native grasses.  Tree species are mainly post oak and blackjack oak with an understory of yaupon, grasses, and other shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in Texas Claypan Area (MLRA 87A) of east-central Texas.  The series is of large extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Leon County, Texas, 1985.

REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included within the Demona series.  The original concept was a soil with a fine textured control section.  Additional data has shown that the area mapped as Robco soils typically have a clay content of 30 to 35 percent.  These soils have slow permeability.  In 1988, it was changed to fine-loamy family.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in) (A and E horizons)
Albic horizon: 38 to 71 cm (15 to 28 in)
Arenic feature: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in), loamy fine sand texture.
Argillic horizon: 71 to 208 cm (28 to 82 in) (Bt/E, Btg1, and Btg2 and BCt horizons)
Reduced matrix: 84 to 165 cm (33 to 65 in) (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations:  84 to 165 cm (33 to 65 in) (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)
Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less: 38 to 71 cm (15 to 28 in). (E horizons)
Episaturation: The zone of saturation at 69 to 119 cm (27 to 65 in) (Btg1, and Btg2 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Base saturation by hach Kit was 50 percent at 127 cm (50 in) below top of the argillic horizon at the type location, 91 percent at another location in Robertson County, and 77 percent from a pedon in Leon County, Texas.  Results of mechanical analysis by the hydrometer method at the type location in Brazos County.

Also, NSSL data from pedon in Leon County Texas S82TX-289-26 (S82P3199- 3207).
