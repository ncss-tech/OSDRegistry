ROCKTON SERIES

The Rockton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments with or without a thin paleosol over limestone bedrock.  These soils are on plane and convex slopes on summits and shoulder slopes on uplands, high structural benches, strath terraces, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 800 centimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Stephenson County, Illinois, in 1939.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 38 to 79 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 79 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 centimeters (Ap and AB horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 79 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
lithic contact--the contact with limestone bedrock at 79 centimeters;
udic moisture regime.

The upper 0.3 to 1.5 meters of limestone may be significantly fractured and may not be a root restrictive layer.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
