ROZARA SERIES

Rozara series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Rozara soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Rozara very gravelly loamy coarse sand--rangeland.  The soil surface is covered with approximately 50 percent gravel. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 2 cm; needles, leaves and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.

     A--2 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few medium tubular and common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

     Bt1--8 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular and common very fine and fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films coating sand grains; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

     Bt2--18 to 30 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; common very fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films coating sand grains; 65 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary; (10 to 15 cm thick).

     R--30 cm; granite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada about 5 miles north of Silver Zone Pass in the Toano Range; approximately 2000 feet east and 2400 feet south of the projected northwest corner of section 17, T.36 N., R.68 E.; USGS Cobre SE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 00 minutes 10 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 18 minutes, 25 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.0027778 latitude, -114.3069444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist late fall through spring, dry in summer through mid fall; typic xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 25 to 36 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 14 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 45 to 60 percent. Dominantly 2 to 5 mm granitic fragments.

A horizon
Chroma: 1 or 2 moist.

Bt horizon 
Value: 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 1 or 2 moist.
Texture: sandy loam or loam
Clay content: 14 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 45 to 60 percent.
Structure: Weak or moderate, fine and medium subangular blocky.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bellenmine, Celeridge, Gabica, Genoa, Gerdog, Gidwin, Grandeposit, Hawkridge, Hutchley, Loope, Majorsplace, Mattier, Melling, Pernog, Realmcoy, Shalcleav, and Tweener series. 

Bellenmine, Celeridge, Gabica, Genoa, Gerdog, Gidwin, Grandeposit, Hutchley, Loope, Majorsplace, Mattier, Melling, Pernog, Realmcoy, Shalcleav, and Tweener contain greater than 18 percent clay. Hawkridge soils are not dominated by fine gravel and the gravel is composed of volcanic rocks.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rozara soils are on mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 2,015 to 2,380 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 460 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.  and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cucamungo and Pioche series.  Cucamungo soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle size control section and are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Pioche soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Curlleaf mountainmahagony, singleleaf pinyon, mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada. MLRA 28B. These soils are not extensive.
