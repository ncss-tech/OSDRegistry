Ream soils have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Wursten series.  Wursten soils are well drained and do not have a lithologic discontinuity of skeletal material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ream soils are on undulating stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 6,100 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, average annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F., the frost free period is 65 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Iphil (T), Merkley (T), and Lago (T) soils.  Iphil and Merkley soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section.  Iphil soils are well drained.  Merkley soils are moderately well drained.  Lago soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and are somewhat poorly drained.  Iphil soils are on loess covered uplands and terraces above Ream soils.  Merkley soils are on similar landscapes as Ream, but are on convex slopes when associated with Ream soils.  Lago soils are on silty alluvium covered flood plains lower on the landscape than Ream soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ream soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland and hayland and pastureland.  Typical crops consist of small grains.  The potential native vegetation is Basin big sagebrush and mixed grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent. MLRA 13.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008.  The name is taken from an irrigation canal in the area where the soil was first mapped.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 13 inches (the Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).

Calcic horizon - the zone from 13 to 24 inches (the Btk and Bk1 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 13 inches to 40 inches (the Btk, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 and part of the 2Cq1 horizon).  The particle size control section will be from 10 to 40 inches when the plow layer is less than 10 inches.
