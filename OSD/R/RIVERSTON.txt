RIVERSTON SERIES

The Riverston series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loamy alluvium over outwash. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cottonwood County, Minnesota, 2009. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; 
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 79 centimeters (Ap, A, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 79 centimeters to a depth of 91 centimeters (Bg horizon);
aquic moisture regime. 

This series was formerly included in Millington, sandy substratum phase.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
