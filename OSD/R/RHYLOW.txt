RHYLOW SERIES

The Rhylow series consists of very deep and well drained soils on tablelands, canyons, foothills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. These soils formed in local alluvium and colluvium derived from loess, volcanic ash and igneous or sedimentary rocks. Rhylow soils have a moderately rapid permeability. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Potrmound and Prong series. Potrmound and Prong soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rhylow soils are on disected tablelands, incised drainageways and sideslopes of foothills and mountains. Slopes are complex and range from 4 to 70 percent. The soil formed in colluvium or local alluvium from loess, volcanic ash and igneous and sedimentary rocks. Cobbles and stones are dominantly angular. Elevations range from 5,300 to 10,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 35 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 29 to 39 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fitzwil and Koffgo series. These soils occur intermixed with the Rhylow soils. Fitzwil soils have thick E horizons to depths of 24 to 40 inches over an argillic horizon. Koffgo soils have ochric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rhylow soils are used for wildlife habitat, recreation and woodland. These soils commonly support lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry, lodgepole pine/pinegrass and Douglas fir/pinegrass communities. Recent clearcut areas of these soils support communities dominated by pinegrass or elk sedge. The potential native vegetation are the subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry and subalpine fir/pinegrass plant associations.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho and northwestern Wyoming. The soil is of moderate extent.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, isotic Vitrandic Dystrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, isotic Vitrandic Humicryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
