ROWENA SERIES

The Rowena series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on terraces on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Almost all of the acreage is used as dry cropland for growing cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Some areas are irrigated. In the few areas of native vegetation the grasses are dominantly buffalograss, curly mesquite, and blue grama and a few mid grasses with sparse overstory of mesquite trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Land Resource Region - H; MLRA - 78A (Rolling Limestone Prairie), MLRA - 78C (Central Rolling Red Plains, Eastern Part), and MLRA - 80B (Texas North Central Prairie). The series is extensive.
