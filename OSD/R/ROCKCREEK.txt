ROCKCREEK SERIES

The Rockcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and till derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks. The Rockcreek soils are on seeps of mountain slopes, glacial-valley floors, and glacial-valley walls of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ladderlake soils. Ladderlake soils have Bw horizons, are on flood-plain steps with 0 to 4 percent slopes, and undergo occasional to frequent ponding for long duration.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rockcreek soils are on seeps of mountain slopes, glacial-valley floors, and glacial -valley walls. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. These soils formed in organic material over alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and till derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks. Elevation is 2450 to 3615 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 530 to 1455 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -1 to 5 degrees C. The frost free season is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Benchlake and Forgotten soils. The Benchlake soils are well drained soils on structural benches of mountain slopes and glacial-valley walls, have an ochric epipedon, and are shallow to lithic contact. The Forgotten soils are moderately well drained soils on high-gradient drainageways on mountain slopes and glacial valley walls, and have an umbric epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Occasional flooding for very brief to brief (4 hrs to 7 days) duration from May to July. Seasonal high water table at 25 to 100 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is Sierra and Lemmon's willow, shootingstar, Carex species, assorted perennial grasses, and scattered Sierra lodgepole pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
