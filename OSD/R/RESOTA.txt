RESOTA SERIES

The Resota series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that occur on broad, moderately high ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. They formed in thick beds of sandy marine deposits.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 152 cm.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, uncoated Spodic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Resota fine sand -- woodland.  (Colors are for moist soil)

     A--0 to 4 inches (0-10 cm); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) rubbed, fine sand; single grained; loose; many fine and medium roots; surface has salt and pepper appearance when dry; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

     E--4 to 19 inches (10-48 cm); light gray (10YR 7/1) sand; single grained; loose; few medium roots; moderately acid; abrupt, wavy boundary.  (15 to 86 cm thick)

     Bw1--19 to 27 inches (40-68 cm); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sand; single grained; loose; about 20 percent of horizon is light gray (10YR 7/1) tongues from the E horizon and having yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) organic stained exteriors; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 51 cm thick)

     Bw2--27 to 42 inches (68-107 cm); yellow (10YR 7/6) sand; single grained; loose; few coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) redoximorphic accumulations; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 76 cm thick)

     C1--42 to 51 inches (107-130 cm); very pale brown (10YR 8/4) fine sand; single grained; loose; few fine and medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/1) areas of redoximorphic depletions; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

     C2--51 to 80 inches (130-203 cm); white (10YR 8/1) sand; single grained; loose; common medium distinct streaks and masses of very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of redoximorphic accumulation; slightly acid.

The solum is 40 inches (102 cm) or more in thickness. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid throughout. 
Particle-size control section (weighted averages):
Clay content: 0.75 to 3.25 percent

A or Ap horizon: has 
Hue: of 10YR, 
Value: of 4 to 6, and moist

COMPETING SERIES: There are no known series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: thick beds derived from sandy marine deposits
Landform: Ridges on Marine Terraces
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Slopes: 0 to 8 percent
Resota soils are on moderately high coastal ridges near the Gulf of Mexico. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. They formed in thick beds of sandy marine deposits. 
Mean annual air temperature- 20 to 22 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation: 1400 to 1650 mm
Frost - free period: 240 to 300 days
The average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches and average annual temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Centenary, Chipley, Dorovan, Foxworth, Kureb, Lakeland, Osier, Pottsburg, and Rutlege soils. 
Centenary and Pottsburg soils have well developed spodic horizons. In addition, the well drained to somewhat excessively drained Centenary soils are on higher positions and the poorly to somewhat poorly drained Pottsburg soils are on lower positions. 
Chipley and Osier soils are on lower positions and do not have weak spodic or cambic horizons. 
Chipley soils are somewhat poorly drained.
Osier soils are poorly drained. 
Dorovan soils are very poorly drained on adjacent lower positions and are organic. 
Foxworth and Lakeland soils do not have weakly expressed spodic horizons. 
Foxworth soils are moderately well to somewhat excessively drained on similar to higher positions.
Lakeland soils are excessively drained on higher positions. 
Kureb soils are on higher positions and are excessively drained. 
Rutlege soils are on adjacent lower positions and have an umbric epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class - Moderately well drained
Flooding - none
Ponding - none
Ksat - Very High
Moderately well drained; very rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas of Resota soils are cut over woodlands or cleared for urban development. Native vegetation consists of sand pine, slash pine, longleaf pine, dwarf live oak, and turkey oak with an understory of native shrubs, sawpalmetto, rosemary and sparse pineland threeawn. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Eastern Gulf Coast, MLRA 152A; Southern Coastal Plain, MLRA Coastal thermic areas of north Florida and possibly Alabama and Georgia.  The series is of small known extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bay County, Florida, 1982. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 19 inches (48 cm). (A and E horizon) 
Albic horizon - the zone from approximately 4 to 19 inches (10 to 48 cm). (E horizon) 
Particle size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 cm.
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation at A water table is at depths of 40 to 60 inches (102 to 152 cm) for 6 months or more in most years and 60 to 80 inches (152 to 203 cm) in dry seasons. 
Resota soils were formerly mapped as inclusions in the Kureb and later as a Variant of the Orsino series. 
ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization sample: Sampled as S3-4-(1-6) IFAS, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.
