RABBITEX SERIES

The Rabbitex series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum weathered from calcareous sedimentary rocks. Rabbitex soils are on structural benches, mountainsides and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rabbitex flaggy loam - native range.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) flaggy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent flagstones on the surface, 5 percent fine channers within horizon; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 21 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent channers; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk2--21 to 43 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) channery loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent channers; violently effervescent with lime disseminated and as soft masses; strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (12 to 32 inches thick)

    R--43 inches; fractured calcareous sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rio Blanco County, Colorado; about 20 miles south of Rangely and 2 miles northwest of Texas Mountain; 1,540 feet south and 20 feet east of the northwest corner of Sec. 8, T. 3 S., R 102 W.; Texas Creek  USGS quad; Lat. 39 degrees 48 minutes 18 seconds N. and Long. 108 degrees 52 minutes 32 seconds W., NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that peaks from July to October and falls evenly throughout the remainder of the year; the soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section less than 6/10 of the time in most years between May 10 and October 30; aridic ustic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 40 to 47 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 59 to 62 degrees F.
Depth to lithic contact; 40 to more than 60 inches, but is generally less than 60 inches
Depth to calcic horizon: 15 to 43 inches
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 7 to 14 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average)
  Clay content: 18 to 35 percent
  Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mainly channers and gravel

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Rock fragments: 5 to 35 percent
Structure: Granular structure, in some pedons subangular blocky structure is in the lower part.

Bk horizon: (BCk is present in some pedons)
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: Loam or sandy clay loam or clay loam modified by gravel, channers, cobbles and stones  
Clay content: 15 to 35 percent 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 2 to 40 percent
Reaction: Slightly to strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Emmons (CO), Headwaters (MT), Rothican (WY), Rothiemay (MT), and Zinzer (CO) series. Emmons soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, a calcic horizon at 8 to 20 inches, and do not have a lithic contact. Headwaters soils have a calcic horizon at 5 to 13 inches and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Rothican, Rothiemay and Zinzer soils do not have a lithic contact. Zinzer soils also have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rabbitex soils are on structural benches, mountainsides, and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  The soil formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum weathered from calcareous sedimentary rocks (marlstone, calcareous shale, siltstone and sandstone).  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches, which is evenly distributed in forms of rain and snow.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period varies from 70 to 120 days.  In Utah the frost free-period is as low as 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Moyerson, Rentsac, and Work soils.  Moyerson soils have an ochric epipedon, are shallow, fine-textured, and have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Rentsac soils have an ochric epipedon, have a lithic contact within 20 inches, and are loamy-skeletal.  Work soils have an argillic horizon which is fine-textured and of montmorillonitic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing as habitat for wildlife and for watershed purposes.  Native vegetation consists of pinyon, serviceberry, spiny phlox, and bluebunch wheatgrass.  In Utah this soil is under Gambel oak and ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Colorado and eastern parts of Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34B.  The series is of moderate extent.
