Mean annual soil temperature: about 32 degrees F., 0 C.
Thickness of loess mantle: 40 to 60 inches, 102 to 152 cm

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR to 10YR; value of 2 or 3; chroma of 1 or 2
Texture: slightly or moderately decomposed plant material
Reaction: extremely acid to strongly acid

A horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR to N; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: silt loam or mucky silt loam
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid

B horizons:
Color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or stratified silt loam and very fine sandy loam
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly acid

BC or C horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam, very sandy loam, sandy loam, or stratified silt loam to sandy loam modified by 0 to 25 percent total coarse fragments, 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

2C horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 to 5; and value of 1 to 4.

Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kenspur and Minto series. Kenspur series are slightly calcareous. Minto soils lack coarse fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess over alluvium
Landform: stream terraces, escarpments on stream terraces
Slope: 0 to 50 percent
Mean annual temperature: 24 to 34 degrees F., -4.4 to 1.1 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 15 inches, 254 to 381 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the list soil series. Volkmar soils occur on terraces and are moderately well drained. Tetlin soils are on bedrock cored hills and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, low to high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat, woodland, and small grains, grasses, and vegetables.  The native vegetation includes black spruce, white spruce, and paper birch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229, Interior Alaska Lowlands, The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Salcha-Big Delta Area, Alaska, 1967.

REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include:
Cambic horizon of feature: from 7 to 18 inches, 18 to 46 cm
Particle size control section: coarse-silty from 12 to 42 inches from top of soil surface
Temperature regime: Cryic
Moisture regime: Udic
Under a thick O horizon, a subsurface layer in these soils may remain frozen throughout the summer, indicating a mean annual soil temperature of 0 degrees C. or less in those soils.  Investigation to determine the prevailing temperature regime in Richardson soils is needed for accurate classification (SR, 5/78).

In the spring water is perched on seasonal frost.
