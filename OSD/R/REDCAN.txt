REDCAN SERIES

The Redcan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale and calcareous sandstone. These soils are on south and west facing slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid, shallow Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Redcan cobbly loam, rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Al--0 to 2 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) cobbly heavy loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; string thin and medium platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots 25 percent angular cobbles; strongly calcareous, lime is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    C1--2 to 6 inches, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) cobbly heavy loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; string medium platy structure that parts to moderate very fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; 30 percent angular cobbles and pebbles strongly calcareous, lime is disseminated moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 5 inches thick)

    C2--6 to 15 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) very gravelly heavy loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; 60 percent soft, angular fine gravel; strongly calcareous, lime is dis-seminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt irregular boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

    C3r--15 to 20 inches, fractured soft shale .

TYPE LOCATION: Morgan, Utah; about 7 miles east and one mile south of Lost Creek Dam; 300 feet east and 400 feet south of the NW corner of sec. 15, T.SN., R.6E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soft shale or calcareous sandstone occurs at depths of 15 to 20 inches . The mean annual soil temperature immediately above the bedrock ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature ranges from 61 to 65 degrees F. The soils are usually moist when the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F., but are dry for 65 to 85 consecutive days during the summer.

The Al horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry. It ranges from cobbly loam to cobbly light clay loam, with 15 to 25 percent angular cobbles and 0 to 15 percent angular pebbles.

The C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist. It ranges from cobbly loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly loam to very gravelly clay loam, and has 30 to 70 percent rock fragments. This horizon ranges from 13 to 14 inches thick.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Emigration, Etchen and Foxol series.  Emigration soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches and have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. Etchen soils have argillic horizons and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Foxol soils have a mollic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redcan soils are at elevations of 6,000 to 7,000 feet. They occur on south and west facing mountain slopes. Slopes range from 40 to 60 percent. These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium weathered from shale and calcareous sandstone. The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 20 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F., and the frost free period ranges from 75 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Guilder, Hoskin and Yeljack soils and the competing Etchen soils. Guilder soils have argillic horizons and are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Hoskin soils have mollic epipedons and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Yeljack soils have mollic epipedons, A2 horizons, and argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for watershed, range and wildlife habitat. The present native vegetation is sparse amounts of big sagebrush, snowberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, juniper And balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Utah. This series is inextensive.
