RIRIE SERIES

The Ririe series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess. Ririe soils are on hills, mountain slopes and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ririe silt loam, cultivated, with a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 1890 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Ap1--0 to 15 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam,  dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few krotovinas; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

	Ap2--15 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 18 to 40 cm)

	Bk1--23 to 36 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent (23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

	Bk2--36 to 64 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common calcium carbonate masses and veins; many moderately cemented spherical coarse calcium carbonate nodules; strongly effervescent (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary.

	Bk3--64 to 89 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common calcium carbonate masses and veins; common coarse calcium carbonate nodules; strongly effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); gradual smooth boundary.

	Bk4--89 to 124 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few very fine calcium carbonate veins; strongly effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 70 to 125 cm)

	C--124 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (17 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); very strongly alkaline (pH 9).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gird and Rexburg series. Gird soils have a cambic horizon above the calcic horizon, have a maximum of 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the calcic horizon.  Rexburg soils have a cambic horizon above the calcic horizon and depth to the calcic horizon is 46 to 89 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: hills, valley, mountains, plateaus, alluvial plains, outwash plains,
  Landform: hills, hillslope, mountain slope, ridge, fan remnant, terrace, and lava plains
  Elevation: 1402 to 2282 meters
  Slope: 0 to 80 percent
  Parent material: loess and silty alluvium derived from loess
  Mean annual air temperature: 2.2 to 7.8 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rin, Tetonia, Lostine, Kucera, and Iphil soils. All of these soils occur on the same landforms. Rin and Tetonia soils have a cryic soil temperature regime. Rin soils are in swales and on north slopes, have a mollic epipedon over 40 cm thick and do not have a calcic horizon. Tetonia soils are on linear and convex positions on north slopes and have a mollic epipedon over 40 cm thick. Lostine, Kucera, and Iphil soils have a frigid soil temperature regime. Lostine soils are in swales, have a mollic epipedon over 50 cm thick and do not have a calcic horizon. Kucera soils are on hills, have a mollic epipedon over 50 cm thick and depth to the calcic horizon is 50 cm or more. Iphil soils are on eroded convex positions and are calcareous to the surface.
