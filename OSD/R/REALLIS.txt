REALLIS SERIES

The Reallis series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and minor amounts of eolian material. Reallis soils are on alluvial fans and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Durinodic Xeric Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Reallis sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Bkq2--69 to 91 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) loamy sand, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; 5 percent durinodes; secondary carbonates segregated as common fine masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 38 cm thick) 

     C--91 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) and black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) and black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). 

TYPE LOCATION: Harney County, Oregon; south of Dog Mountain between Harney Valley and Sunset Valley; about 2,100 feet north and 2,600 feet west of the southeast corner of section 36, T. 25 S., R. 30 E.; USGS Northeast Harney Lake 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 21 minutes 32 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 04 minutes 06 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section in winter and early spring, dry from about May 15 to October 15; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C. 
Depth to base of cambic horizon: 25 to 89 cm. 
Depth to horizon with firm, brittle matrix: 25 to 90 cm. 
Depth to horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates: 40 to 90 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 5 to 15 percent. 
Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravel. Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as basalt and tuff.

Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist. 

Bw and Bq horizons
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Durinodes (when present): 5 to 20 percent in the Bq horizon.
Other features: In some pedons the consistence of the Bq horizon is firm and brittle when moist.

Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture:  Sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
Clay content:  5 to 15 percent.

Identifiable secondary carbonates: Occur as few or common fine masses or coats on durinodes.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.
Other features: In some pedons a Bk horizon underlies the Bkq2 horizon with color and texture similar to the C horizon. 

C horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 2 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4, dry or moist.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Humdun, Poorma, and Silverado series. 
Humdun and Poorma soils do not have horizons with firm consistence and a brittle manner of failure. Silverado soils average 10 to 30 percent gravel in the particle-size control section and have horizons of very gravelly sand or very gravelly coarse sand within 100 cm of the soil surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Reallis soils are on alluvial fans and lake terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and minor amounts of eolian material. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ausmus, Poujade, and Vergas soils. Ausmus soils are fine-silty and have natric horizons. Poujade soils are fine-loamy and have natric horizons. Vergas soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have argillic horizons. All these soils are on lake terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Reallis soils are used for rangeland. The vegetation commonly is basin big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, needleandthread, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
