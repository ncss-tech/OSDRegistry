ROCKPENS SERIES

The Rockpens series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations, and the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite (welded tuff).  These very gently sloping soils are on late-Pleistocene stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rockpens soils are on late-Pleistocene stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent and are plane to convex in shape.  The soil formed in alluvium derived predominantly from tuffaceous sediments of the Duff and Pruett Formations, with rock fragments derived from the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches, with most occurring from July through September.  Mean annual air temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 280 days.  Elevation ranges from 2,500 to 4,500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Beewon, Borunda, Musgrave, Quadria, and Straddlebug series.  Beewon and Quadria soils are on mid-Pleistocene pediments and have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Borunda soils are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock, are in the fine-loamy family, and have calcic and gypsic horizons.  Borunda soils occur on higher erosional slopes and pediments.  Musgrave soils are very shallow or shallow to tuffaceous bedrock, are in the clayey family, and are on higher erosional scarps and uplands.  Straddlebug soils are on lower Holocene-age alluvial flats and floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is very low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used as livestock grazing.  The native vegetation consists of black grama, bush muhly, sideoats grama, blue grama, plains bristlegrass, Arizona cottontop, and cane bluestem.  The woody species consist of range ratany, creosotebush, and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Trans-Pecos Texas in the Southern Desertic Basins, Plains, and Mountains (MLRA 42), Desert Grassland vegetative zone.  The soil is of minor extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Brewster County, Texas; 1997.  The name is from a rock corral near the type location.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 27 inches (Bn1 and Bn2 horizons)

Paralithic contact - the boundary at 69 inches (2Crk horizon)

Sodic feature - Sodium adsorption ratio of greater than 13 within a horizon that is at least 10 inches thick within the upper 40 inches of the pedon.
