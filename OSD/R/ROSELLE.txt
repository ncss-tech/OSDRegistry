ROSELLE SERIES

The Roselle series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from coarse grained, acid igneous rocks, primarily granite. These soils are on terraces and footslopes in mountain basins. Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chilmark, Hassler, Thurmont, and Tulip series. Chilmark soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F.. Hassler soils have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. Thurmont soils formed in material weathered from metamorphic rocks. Tulip soils average 15 to 34 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Roselle soils are on terraces and footslopes on basin-floor remnants in mountain basins. The soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from coarse grained, acid igneous rocks, predominantly granite. Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Courtois, Delassus, Irondale, Killarney, Knobtop, Relfe, Secesh, Skranka, Syenite, and Trackler soils. Courtois soils are fine textured, have a stone line, and are on similar landscape postions. Delassus and the loamy-skeletal Killarney soils have a fragipan and are at higher elevations. Irondale, and Taumsauk soils are loamy-skeletal and are higher in the landscape. Knobtop soils are moderately deep, fine-silty and are on ridgetops of mountainous areas. Relfe and Secesh soils are better drained and are on floodplains and lower terraces. Skranka soils are fine textured and have a higher base saturation and are on similar positions. Syenite soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and are at higher elevations. Trackler soils are deep to hard igneous rocks and are at higher elevations. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is medium. Permeability is moderate. A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 2.0 to 4.0 feet during winter or early spring in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in grasses and legumes. The soils are used mainly for pasture and hay crops. Other areas are in timber and a few areas are used for grain production. Native vegetation was hardwoods and shortleaf pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are on igneous landscapes in the St. Francois Mountains, a physiographic subdivision of the Missouri Ozarks (MLRA 116A). The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Madison County, Missouri, 1998. 

REMARKS: The CEC/clay ratio for this pedon is .39, which would place it in the subactive family. However, the majority of the profiles sampled are in the active family, so active was used for the classification.Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (Ap and E horizons)2) argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 57 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri soil characterization lab number M9312331.These soils were previously mapped with Courtois, Delassus, and Syenite soils.
