MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bacon County, Georgia, 1983.  Source of the name is a small stream near the type location.  The alternate name is Bacon.

REMARKS: Rigdon soils were formerly included in the Olustee series.

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to approximately 7 inches (A horizon).
Spodic horizon - the zone from approximately 7 to 11 inches (Bh horizon).
Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 38 to 80 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).
