REHOBETH SERIES

The Rehobeth series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from gypsiferous shale. Rehobeth soils are on valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Chromic Gypsitorrerts

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Berryhill (NM) series. Berryhill soils have 10YR or 2.5Y Hues. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rehobeth soils formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from gypsiferous shale and are on flood plains on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 6600 to 6800 feet. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The frost free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Berryhill, Casamero, Penistaja, and Tintero soils on fan terraces; and the Ojocal soils on flood plains. The Casamero soils are shallow to shale. The Penistaja and Tintero soils are fine-loamy. The Ojocal soils lack vertic properties and a gypsic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high runoff, and very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for rangeland. The present vegetation is black greasewood and alkali sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico; MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
