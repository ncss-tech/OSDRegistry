REDINGTON SERIES

The Redington series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed on hills from mixed stream alluvium and fan alluvium. Slope is 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Redington very gravelly fine sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    C--2 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Cd--10 to 14 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 inches thick)

    C'--14 to 28 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (14 to 20 inches thick)

    C'd--28 to 40 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (9 to 15 inches thick)

    C''--40 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) stratified gravelly coarse sand and sand; massive; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Pima County, Arizona; 850 feet west and 710 feet south of the northeast corner of section 2, T.12.S., R.18.E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.   Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  62 to 72 degrees F.

Reaction: slightly to strongly alkaline

Reaction: noneffervescent to violently effervescent

Surface rock fragments: 10 to 40 percent gravel and, or cobble

Rock fragments:  5 to 45 percent gravel, cobble and petronodes in any one horizon; averages less than 35 percent in the control section

A horizon
Hue:   10YR, 7.5YR
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  3 through 6, dry or moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 10 percent
Gypsum content: 0 to 5 percent

C horizon
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR
Value:  4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma:  3 through 6, dry or moist
Textures:  sand, loamy sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam, coarse sand (averages less than 8 percent clay)
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 25 percent
Gypsum content: 0 to 10 percent

Cd horizons
Dense sediments that are intergrades between soft sediments (C material) and soft bedrock (Cr material).  These naturally compacted sediments have been subjected to a slow reduction in volume and increase in density from deep water loading in the geologic past.  These materials easily break down in water and roots can penetrate when moist.  They are root restrictive when dry.
Hue: 7.5YR, 5YR
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture:  fine sand, sand, coarse sand, loamy sand
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 35 percent
Gypsum content: 5 to 10 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amole (AZ), Box (CA), Challenger (CA), Hypoint (NV), Livefire (CA), Orwash (NV), Shortbread (AZ), and Yellowrock (CA) series. These soils do not have Cd horizons.  The Box series is inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Redington soils are on fan terraces, hills, and dissected relict lake beds.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  They formed in mixed stream alluvium and fan alluvium from prehistoric lakes and marshes.  Elevation ranges from 2,200 to 4,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation in 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Redo, Queencreek, Contention, Nahda, Stagecoach, and Delnorte soils.  Redo and Stagecoach soils have calcic horizons.  Queencreek soils are sandy-skeletal.  Nahda and Delnorte soils have petrocalcic horizons.  Contention soils are fine textured.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; moderate runoff; moderately rapid to rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Redington soils are used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation includes creosotebush, mesquite, black grama, snakeweed, annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  This series is of small extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRAs 40 and 41.
