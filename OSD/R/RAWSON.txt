RAWSON SERIES

The Rawson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy sediments and till on till plains, outwash plains and lake plains. They are moderately deep or deep to dense till. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adamstown, Beech, Blakeslee, Cazenovia, El Dara, Funkstown, Hilton, Kidami, Miami, Mt. Zion, Pevely, Rainsville, Richland, Shawtown, Summitville, and Vaughnsville series. Adamstown and Kidami soils do not have a densic contact within the series control section. Beech, Blakeslee, El Dara, Funkstown, and Mt. Zion soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 122 cm (48 inches). Cazenovia and Richland soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Hilton soils have less than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Miami soils have less than 40 percent sand in the argillic horizon. Pevely soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Rainsville soils are deeper than 114 cm (45 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Shawtown soils average less than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Summitville soils have rock fragments of shale, sandstone, and siltstone lithology. Vaughnsville soils have hue yellower than 5YR in the upper part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rawson soils are on till plains, outwash plains, and lake plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Rawson soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy sediments and the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.8 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aurand, Blount, Glynwood, Haskins, Houcktown, Hoytville, Mermill, Morley, Muncie and Pewamo soils. Haskins, Houckton, and Mermill soils are in a toposequence with the Rawson soils. The somewhat poorly drained Aurand, Blount and Haskins soils and the moderately well drained Houcktown soils are on less sloping or lower lying landform positions. The very poorly drained Pewamo and Mermill soils are in depressions. The very poorly drained Hoytville soils are on flats and in depressions. The moderately well drained Glynwood and Morley soils are on slightly higher or more sloping landform positions. The well drained Muncie soils are on higher lying positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) between January and April in normal years. Potential for surface water runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low or low in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderate in the loamy sediments, moderately slow in the 2B horizons, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas are used for tomatoes and sugar beets, and a few areas are used for pasture or remain in woods. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Primarily in MLRAs 111B and 111C in east-central and northeastern Indiana and west-central Ohio, and to a lesser extent in MLRA 99 in northwestern Ohio and in MLRA 139 in northeastern Ohio. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Allen County, Ohio, 1963. 

REMARKS: The 5/2000 revision of the Rawson Series moved the type location to Indiana, at least temporarily. Future updates of the soil surveys in Indiana and Ohio may require it to be moved again. This revision also incorporated the concept of the Royerton Series into the range of the Rawson soils, thus the Royerton Series became inactive. Detailed analysis of the clay contents of the till members in which these soils have been formed indicated the two series could not be consistently separated. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (Ap).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 109 cm (10 to 43 inches) (Bt, 2BCt).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data for this pedon is from the Purdue University Lab No. S79IN33-3-(1-7).
