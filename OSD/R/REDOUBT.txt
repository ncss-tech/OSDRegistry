COMPETING SERIES: This is the Puntilla series. Puntilla soils have firm consistence in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over loamy glacial till
Landform: nunataks on till plains and disintegration moraines on till plains
Slopes: 0 to 45 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 35 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Iliamna and Talkeetna soils. Iliamna and Talkeetna soils are well drained and occur on similar landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and moderately high to high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for forestry, wildlife habitat, and recreation. The native vegetation is Lutz spruce,, paper birch, alder, tall grass, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska, The series is of small extent.
