RUSSIROKS SERIES

The Russiroks series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks. Russiroks soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chuckawalla (CA+AZ), Cololag (NV), Cristobal (AZ), Havasulake (CA), Ironage (CA) and Pinamt (AZ) series. Chuckawalla, Cristobal and Pinamt series average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Cololag soils are 25 to 40 centimeters to an argillic horizon and do not have a surface C horizon comprised of 90 to 100 percent rock fragments. Havasulake soils are dry throughout most of the year and have a mean annual soil temperature of 25 to 28 degrees C. Ironage soils are formed in residuum and are moderately deep (50 to 100 centimeters) to a lithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Russiroks soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks. Elevations range from 170 to 455 meters (560 to 1,490 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Carrizo soil. Carrizo soils are on adjacent alluvial fans, fan remnants and drainageways, have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and do not have diagnostic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity above and within the argillic horizon and high saturated hydraulic conductivity below the argillic horizon.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Russiroks soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly sparse creosote bush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
