ROUETTE SERIES

The Rouette series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Rouette soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Rabbithills, Scalade, Shabliss, Trio, Truvar, and Unius series. 

Rabbithills, Scalade and Shabliss soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October. Trio soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Truvar soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C. Unius soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rouette soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,135 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are the Huilepass and Summermute soils. Huilepass and Summermute soils are very deep. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Rouette soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, and galleta. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
