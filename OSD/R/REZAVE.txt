REZAVE SERIES

The Rezave series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Rezave soils are on summits and side slopes of hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey, smectitic, mesic Lithic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rezave stony very fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with approximately 15 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent gravel.

    Btnqk--33 to 43 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) very gravelly clay, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard and brittle, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few roots; few fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; common faint and few distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; weak discontinuous silica cementation; few carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear broken boundary. (0 to 23 cm thick)

    Bqk--43 to 48 cm; white (10YR 8/1) very stony clay loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; massive; very hard and brittle, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent stones; weak discontinuous silica cementation; common carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

    R--48 cm; hard, slightly fractured basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rezave soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fireball and Pirouette soils.  Fireball soils are loamy-skeletal, deep to hard bedrock, and occur on adjacent hills and mountains.  Pirouette soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to a thin duripan over hard bedrock, and occur on adjacent hills and mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rezave soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Bailey's greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  They occur dominantly in MLRA 27, but have also been mapped in MLRAs 23 and 24.
