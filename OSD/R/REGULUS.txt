REGULUS SERIES

The Regulus series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Cumulic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Regulus silt loam, in pastureland, on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 1895 meters (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 5 cm; undecomposed and partially decomposed matted roots; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 6 cm)

   A1--5 to 25 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

   A2--25 to 35 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 18 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons - 25 to 45 cm)

   Bg--35 to 79 cm; black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; 10 percent fine and medium, prominent, irregular, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (30 to 50 cm thick)

   Cg1--79 to 117 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; 15 percent fine and medium, prominent, irregular, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 50 cm thick)

   Cg2--117 to 152 cm; variegated, extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 70 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
