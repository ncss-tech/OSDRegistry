RANKOR SERIES

The Rankor series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains.  These soils formed from material weathered mainly from schist[ and granitic rock.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 53 degree F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPE LOCATION:  Kern County, California; in Walker Basin area; about 1,500 feet south and 700 feet west of the northeastern corner of Sec. 31, T.29., R.32E., MDB&M, Oiler Peak Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.

Soil Temperature - The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to
                   58 degrees F.  The soil temperature is
                   greater than 41 degrees F. from about
                   March 1 to December 1 (260 to 280 days)
                   days) and is greater than 47 degrees F
                   from about March 1 to December 1 (250 to
                   290 days).

Soil Moisture - The soils are dry from about June 30 to
                November 15 (140 to 160 days). The soil is
                moist in some or all parts for 90 or more
                consecutive days when the soil temperature is
                greater than 47 degrees F.

                      are sandy loam in the lower part.
            Organic matter: 1 to 3 in the upper part and
                            0.1 to 1 in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adieux, Banning, Coolbrith, Dotta, Drews, Gorman, Harriman, Haysum, Henhill, Lonkey, Robinette, Supan and Wapinitia series.  Adieux and Lonkey soils are less than 40 inches deep, have less than 30 percent slopes, and are formed from extrusive igneous material.  Coolbrith, Dotta, Gorman, Haysum and Henhill soils are formed from alluvium and are more than 60 inches deep.  In addition, Banning, Coolbrith and Henhill soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Harriman soils are formed from sedimentary rock.  Supan soils are volcanic in origin and have a mean annual precipitation of more than 30 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rankor soils are on mountain slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks and schist.  Elevations are 3,000 to 6,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 46 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F.; the mean annual air temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 175 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arujo, Tollhouse, Tunis, Tweedy and Walong soils.  Arujo, Tunis and Walong soils are on southern aspects and have thermic temperature regimes.  Tunis and Tollhouse soils have a paralithic contact within 20 inches of the surface.  Tweedy and Walong soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is mostly big sagebrush, buckbrush, California scrub oak, digger pine, pine bluegrass and ripgut brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Sierra Nevada Range in California.  The series is of small extent in MLRA 18.
