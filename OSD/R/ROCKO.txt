ROCKO SERIES

The Rocko series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Inceptic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Rocko cobbly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed needles and twigs. (1 to 2 inches thick) 

    A--1 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) cobbly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    E--6 to 16 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) stony loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt--16 to 29 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 inches thick)

    BC--29 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 6 inches (Oe, A horizon)
Albic horizon - from 6 to 16 inches (E horizon)
Argillic horizon - from 16 to 29 inches (Bt horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 16 to 29 inches (Bt horizon)

Rocko soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.  

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil interpretation record - MT1438.

Based on thickness of argillic horizon, the classification changed from Ustollic Haplocryalfs to Inceptic Haplocryalfs (01/2008)
