ROCKWET SERIES

The Rockwet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium from irrigation water over silty alluvium derived from sedimentary deposits.  Rockwet soils are on terraces and paleoterraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).
