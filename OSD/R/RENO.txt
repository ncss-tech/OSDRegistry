RENO SERIES

The Reno series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Reno soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and fan collars.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Abruptic Xeric Argidurids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bogusrim, Catchell, Chilcott, Lookout, Lovejoy, Novacan, Pigtail and Suncold series.  

Bogusrim, Catchell, Lookout and Suncold soils have a lithic contact within 150 cm.  Chilcott soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments and more than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Lovejoy soils lack rock fragments in the argillic and have a strongly acid A horizon. Novacan soils lack E horizons and have a strongly cemented duripan in the upper part that is very hard and very firm. Pigtail soils also lack E horizons and have duripans thicker than 76 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reno soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and fan collars.  These soils formed in alluvium, pedisediments and fluvial sediments derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool; semiarid, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 380 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 80 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chalco, Devada, Indian Creek, and Phing soils. Chalco and Devada soils are shallow to bedrock. Indian Creek soils are less than 50 cm deep to the duripan. Phing soils lack duripans.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland, urban development, and wildlife habitat.   The native vegetation is principally low sagebrush, hawksbeard, cheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada and Sierra County, California.  These soils are of moderate extent. MLRA 26
