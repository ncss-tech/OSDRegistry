REAGAN SERIES

The Reagan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable calcareous soils that formed in alluvium and/or eolian deposits derived from limestone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on broad flats, filled valleys and fans. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Tobosa, Iraan, and Lozier series.
Tobosa soils: have vertic features and occur higher on ridges
Iraan soils: are very deep mollisols and occur lower on floodplains
Lozier soils: are loamy-skeletal and occur higher on hillslopes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for rangeland. Some areas are irrigated and used for growing cotton and sorghum. Native vegetation was short and midgrasses. Range now consists dominantly of burrograss and an overstory of tarbush and scrub mesquite trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western and southwestern Texas (MLRA 81A). The series is of large extent.
