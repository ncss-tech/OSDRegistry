RAGGULCH SERIES

The Raggulch series consists of shallow, well drained soils on dissected terraces.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from sedimentary rock, conglomerate, and granitic rock.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Mollic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Raggulch sandy loam, on a terrace escarpment of 23 percent under annual grasses and forbs at an elevation of 940 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless therwise stated.  When described on April 4, 1994, the soil was moist througout.)

    A-- 0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy  loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure;  hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1-- 4 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films bridgings mineral grains and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2-- 8 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam,  very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial and tubular pores; few thin clay films bridging mineral grains; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Cr--16 to 18 inches; soft, partly weathered sandstone

    R-- 18; hard sandstone conglomerate

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Stonyford, Stohlman and Quinto series.  Stonyford and Quinto soils have hue of 7.5YR and 5YR in the Bt horizon.  Stohlman soils have stony and cobbly texture modifiers.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Raggulch soils are on terrace escarpments and treads with  slopes of 5 to 30 percent slope.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium  weathered mainly from sedimentary rock, conglomerate, and granitic rock.  Elevations are 600 to 2,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 49 to 56 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 72 to 80 degrees F., the mean annual temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pleito and Chanac series.  Pleito and Chanac soils are more than 60 inches deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained; medium to rapid runoff;  moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is mostly  annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Terraces on the southeastern edge of the San Joaquin Valley in California.  The series is of small extent.  MLRA is 17.
