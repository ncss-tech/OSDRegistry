ROSEBUD SERIES

The Rosebud series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to weakly cemented fine grain sandstone.  These soils formed in loess and loamy, calcareous residuum weathered from weakly cemented fine grain sandstone on tableland plains and upland hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rosebud loam - on less than 1 percent slope in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick)

  Bt--15 to 28 centimeters (6 to 11 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; thin discontinuous films on faces of peds; common very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) worm casts; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 61 centimeters (5 to 24 inches) thick)

  Bk1--28 to 38 centimeters (11 to 15 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine pebbles; secondary calcium carbonates occuring as soft masses of lime; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  Bk2--38 to 48 centimeters (15 to 19 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; secondary calcium carbonates occurring as soft masses of lime, violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 41 centimeters (16 inches) thick).

  C--48 to 76 centimeters (19 to 30 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; many pebbles and hard caliche fragments; disseminated lime and lime coatings on pebbles; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.

  Cr--76 to 203 centimeters (30 to 80 inches); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) weakly cemented sandstone; few small pebbles; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Capulin, Chacuaco and Wapiti series. 
Capulin and Wapiti soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches).
Chacuaco soils have a lithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess and loamy, calcareous residuum weathered from weakly cemented fine grain sandstone
Landform: nearly level to moderately steep uplands 
Slopes: 0 to 20 percent
Elevation: 762 to 1676 meters (2500 to 5500 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 14 degrees C. (47 to 57 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 36 48 centimeters (14 to 19 inches)
Frost-free period: 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alliance, Ascalon, Canyon, Creighton, Goshen, Oglala, Sidney, Tassel and Tuthill
Alliance and Altvan are on similar landscapes.
Ascalon soils are on slightly higher ridges and knolls in the landscape.
Canyon soils are shallow and on ridges, side slopes, and knolls.
Creighton soils do not have an argillic horizon, are coarse- loamy, and are at slightly lower elevations.
Goshen soils have mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and are in slightly concave positions.
Oglala and Tuthill soils are coarse-silty and on similar landscapes.
Sidney soils are coarse-loamy and on similar landscapes.
Tassel soils are shallow over sandstone and are on ridges, side slopes, and knolls

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:    moderate
Runoff: low to high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rosebud soils are mostly under cultivation, and many areas are irrigated.  
Winter wheat and grain sorghums are the principal dryland crops.  
Corn, alfalfa hay, and sugar beets are the principal irrigated crops.  
Where in rangeland the native vegetation is mid and short prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Rosebud soils are extensive and occur in western Nebraska, southwestern South Dakota, northeastern Colorado, eastern Wyoming and possibly northwestern Kansas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Reconnaissance Soil Survey of Western South Dakota, 1909.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches (Ap and Bt1 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 15 to 28 centimeters (6 to 11 inches) (Bt horizon) 
The Alliance series was formerly included in the Rosebud series.

A calcic horizon is recognized in 8 of 13 soils sample as Rosebud.  This modified the classification from Aridic to Calcidic. PRF 4/25/00

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
