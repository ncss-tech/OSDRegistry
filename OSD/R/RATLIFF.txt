RATLIFF SERIES

The Ratliff series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy, calcareous eolian deposits of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. They are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Ratliff loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(Combined thickness is 45 to 151 cm [18 to 60 in].) 

      Bk3--170 to 203 cm (67 to 80 in); pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) clay loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; 30 percent masses and threads of calcium carbonate; common black coatings on faces of peds; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

Chavaro soils: have an argillic horizon. 
Chispa, Elfrida, Kahn, Laborcita, Pandale, Salado and Tuzigoot soils: are drier in the soil moisture control-section for longer periods. 
Delphos soils: have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section. 
Evanola and San Jon soils: are drier in the soil moisture control-section for slightly longer periods and formed in sandstone and shale sediments of Triassic age. 
Lovington soils: have lower value and chroma in the surface and subsoil horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy, calcareous eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. 
Landform: nearly level to gently undulating plains and playa slopes. 
Slopes: to 5 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C. (57 to 63 degrees F).

Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 21 to 26. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the similar Portales and Wink series and the Blakeney, Conger, Douro and Faskin series. 
Blakeney and Conger soils: are on similar landscape positions and have indurated caliche within 50 cm (20 in) of the soil surface. 
Douro and Faskin soils: are on similar landscape positions and have argillic horizons. 
Portales soils: are on lower landscape positions and have more moisture in the soil moisture control section for longer periods. 
Wink soils: are on similar landscape positions, have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section and are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland but a few areas are cultivated to cotton and grain sorghum. Climax native vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes black grama, blue grama, sideoats grama, silver bluestem, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, plains bristlegrass, and buffalograss, yucca, and a light to moderate overstory of western honey mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the High Lime (R077DY040TX) range site in MLRA-77D. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77D in LRR H); of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is extensive.
