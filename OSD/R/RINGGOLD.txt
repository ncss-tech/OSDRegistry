RINGGOLD SERIES

The Ringgold series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits. These soils are on interdunes of sandhills and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 51 centimeters (20 inches), and mean annual temperature is 9.5 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustepts

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
The mean annual soil temperature is 8 C (46 F) or higher but lower than 15 C (59 F), and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 6 C (43 F) or more at a depth of 50cm (20 inches) below the soil surface.

COMPETING SERIES:
 This is the Birdwood  series.
Birdwood soils average 40 to 55 percent very fine sand in the control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
 Parent material: loamy eolian deposits
Landscape: Nebraska Sand Hills
Landform: mostly on swales on interdunes, a few on hummocks on interdunes
Slope: 0 to 3 percent

Mean annual air temperature: 7 to 10 degrees C. (45 to 50 degrees F.) 
Mean annual precipitation: 43 centimeters to 56 centimeters (17 to 22 inches)
Precipitation pattern: in some part from October through April; intermittently from May through June; driest in July through September.
Frost-free period: 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Dunday, Libory and Valentine soils. 
Dunday soils have a sandy control section, a mollic epipedon and are on similar swales.
Valentine soils have a sandy control section and are on higher hummocks and dunes.
Libory soils are sandy over loamy,  moderately well drained, and are in lower positions on the interdune.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is livestock grazing. The native plant community is mainly little bluestem, prairie sandreed, switchgrass, blue grama, and needleandthread. Some areas are cropped to irrigated corn, soybeans and alfalfa. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nebraska; LRR G, Western Great Plains range and irrigated region Major Land Resource Area 65; Nebraska Sand Hills. This series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: McPherson County, Nebraska, MLRA 65, 2009. The name is from a small nearby town.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (A horizon)

Taxonomic Version: Twelfth edition, 2014.

The Ringgold soils were formerly mapped as Hersh; Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Ustorthents and Anselmo; Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls soils. 

MJK 10/2014  Updated the horizon nomenclature, adjusted the range in characteristics to include measured laboratory data.
