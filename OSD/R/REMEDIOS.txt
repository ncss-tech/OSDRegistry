REMEDIOS SERIES

The Remedios series consists of moderately deep, moderately well and well drained soils that formed in colluvium on footslopes and backslopes of hills and valley sides.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches, and mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Remedios silt loam - on an E facing single slope of 55 percent under conifer forest at 800 feet elevation.  (All colors are for moist soil)

    Oi--2 to 1 inch; undecomposed forest litter.

    Oe--1 inch to 0; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; extremely acid (pH 4.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bh--0 to 1 inch; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam; moderate fine granular structure; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; extremely acid (pH 4.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

    Bs1--1 to 4 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse, medium, and fine roots; 5 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bs2--4 to 8 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; 15 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    C1--8 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; 25 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    C2--12 to 26 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly silt loam; massive; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.5).

    R--26 inches.  Meta-sedimentary bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Ketchikan Area, Alaska; On Suemez Island, 700 feet north and 500 feet west of the SE corner of Section 28, T.76S., R.80E., Copper River Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section has less than 18 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 50 percent. Reaction throughout the profile is extremely or very strongly acid.

The Bh horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture commonly is silt loam, but ranges to include fine sandy loam and loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.

The Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value moist from 2 through 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 4.  Coarse fragment content in the Bs1 horizon ranges from 5 to 15 percent gravel.  Coarse fragment content in the Bs2 horizon ranges from 35 to 50 percent gravel.

The C horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value moist from 3 through 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 6.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 65 percent.  Texture of the C horizons is dominantly silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam or loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Conto(T), Dinzer, Evaro, Homestead, Lastance, Mt. Hood, and Texex series.  Dinzer soils are medium acid in the C horizon.  Evaro soils are slightly acid in the C1 horizon.  Homestead soils contain layers of volcanic ash.  Lastance, Mt. Hood, and Tenex soils contain E horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Remedios soils are on hillslopes and valley sides and formed in colluvium.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of 100 to 200 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kina, Maybeso, and Wadleigh soils.  Kina and Maybeso soils are poorly drained organic soils.  Wadleigh soils are poorly drained mineral soils.  These soils are all on rolling glaciated slopes and overlie till.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderately well drained.  Moderate permeability.  Slow to rapid runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Remedios soils are used for timber production, watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and recreation. The overstory vegetation is dominantly western hemlock and Sitka spruce with lesser amounts of western redcedar and Alaska-cedar.  The understory vegetation is blueberry, huckleberry, ferns, and mosses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Alaska.  The series is of minor extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ketchikan Area, Alaska. 1994.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile include: a spodic horizon from 0 to 8 inches; loamy-skeletal particle-size from 10 to 26 inches; a cryic temperature regime.  No lab data is available for the Remedios soil.  Lab data from associated soils indicates that Remedios would meet the spodic chemical criteria.
