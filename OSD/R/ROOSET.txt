ROOSET SERIES

The Rooset series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from mixed sources. They are on alluvial fans, escarpments, hills, mountains and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rooset gravelly loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

  A--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular and crumb structure; soft, very friable; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

  BA--7 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable; 15 percent gravel; few faint clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

  Bt--11 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very friable; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds, on coarse fragments and fillings in root channels and pores; 50 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 35 inches thick)

  Btk--24 to 30 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very friable; faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; 75 percent gravel; visible secondary calcium carbonate as concretions, in thin seams and streaks, and as coatings on rock fragments; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

  BCk--30 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable; 75 percent gravel; visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions, in thin seams and streaks, and as coatings on rock fragments; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
