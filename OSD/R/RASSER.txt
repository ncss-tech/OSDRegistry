RASSER SERIES

The Rasser series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains and foothills. They formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived from metasedimentary bedrock that is influenced with loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. The average annual temperature is about 44 degrees and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:

Outland - are moderately deep to a paralithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rasser soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains and foothills. Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary bedrock, with an influence of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface.  Elevation ranges from 2,700 to 3,700 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches, including 3 to 6 feet of snow. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arson, Benewah and Huckle soils. Arson soils are on convex south-facing shoulders and backslopes and have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Benewah soils are on concave backslopes and footslopes and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Huckle soils are on north-facing backslopes, have a thick volcanic ash mantle and have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately slow in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for woodland, wildlife habitat, recreation and watershed. Some areas are cleared for hay and pasture. Potential natural overstory is grand fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine and western white pine with an understory of mallow ninebark, oceanspray, spirea, serviceberry, myrtle pachistima, Columbia bromegrass, sweetscented bedstraw, pinegrass, starry false solomonseal and western meadowrue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho; MLRA 43A. The series is of small extent.
