ROCKCREEKBUTTE SERIES

The Rockcreekbutte series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on backslopes of mountains.  Rockcreekbutte soils formed in colluvium from granite with volcanic ash mixed in surface horizons. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, isotic Haploxerandic Humicryepts

  Bw--8 to 21 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) extremely stony coarse sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak, medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine and few medium irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 40 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.
