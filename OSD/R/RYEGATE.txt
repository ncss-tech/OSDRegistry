RYEGATE SERIES

The Ryegate series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in coarse eolian sediments and residuum derived dominantly from hard sandstone.  Ryegate soils are on plains, hills, ridges, and fans.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ryegate sandy loam-range.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt--10 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 inches thick)

    BCt--21 to 30 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    BC--30 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    2Bk--32 to 38 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; visible common soft masses and filaments; calcium carbonate coating on rocks; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches)

    R--38 inches; hard sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Capulin(NM), Chacuaco(CO), Rosebud(NE) and Wapiti(CO) series.
Capulin soils: have a lithic contact greater than 40 inches deep
Chacuaco soils: have secondary carbonates throughout the argillic and average less than 35 percent fine and coarser sand
Rosebud soils: have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
Wapiti soils: are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: hills, ridges, and fans in the plains.  
Slopes: range from 1 to 10 percent.  
Parent material: coarse eolian sediments and residuum derived dominantly from hard sandstone.  
Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,000 feet.
Mean annual air temperature: 50 to 54 degrees F.  
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 16 inches, with peak periods in spring and summer months.  
Frost-free period: 130 to 160 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ascalon, Capulin, Dalerose (T), and Travessilla soils.  Ascalon and Capulin soils are on slightly higher ridges and knolls and are greater than 60 inches to a lithic contact.  Dalerose and Travessilla soils are near areas of rock outcrop and are less than 20 inches to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Principal native vegetation is blue grama, sideoats grama, little bluestem, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  southeastern Colorado; LRR G, MLRA 67;  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Yellowstone County, Montana, 1966.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 10 inches. (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: the zone from 10 to 21 inches. (Bt and BCt horizons)
Calcic horizon: the zone from 32 to 38 inches (2Bk horizon)
Lithic contact: sandstone at 36 inches.
Other features: Aridic ustic moisture regime.  

Remarks: The Ryegate series was first proposed in Yellowstone County, Montana, but was transferred to Las Animas County, Colorado due to a change in temperature regimes in Montana from mesic to frigid.  The series is named after a town close by the original type location.  Last updated by the state 12/89.

Modified by Lee Neve in January 2002 changing taxonomy from Aridic to Calcidic, in addition to basic reformatting to create a semitab format.
