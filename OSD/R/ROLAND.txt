ROLAND SERIES

The Roland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from meandering rivers.  Roland soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on flood plains and terraces of river valley bottoms.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Fluvaquentic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Roland fine sandy loam, located on a forested southwest facing river terrace with a slope of 2 percent and an elevation of 140 meters.  When described on June 10, 2008 the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roland soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on floodplains and terraces of river valley bottoms at elevations from 100 to 600 meters.  They formed in alluvium from meandering rivers.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,300 to 2,500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 8 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Deerlick, Nohokomeen, and Skymo soils.  Deerlick soils have a mantle with andic soil properties greater than 35 cm thick.  Nohokomeen soils are in an Aquandic subgroup and have ashy textural modifiers in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Skymo soils lack a cambic horizon and have a sandy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Roland soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed drainage.  Native vegetation includes black cottonwood, western hemlock, western redcedar, red alder, bigleaf maple, paper birch, vine maple, salmonberry, red huckleberry, devil's club, redosier dogwood, western swordfern, clasping twisted stalk, queen's cup beadlily, piggy-back plant, twinflower, and scouringrush horsetail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
