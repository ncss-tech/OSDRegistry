ROEGULCH SERIES 

The Roegulch series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and hillslopes. Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Roegulch cobbly sandy clay loam, very bouldery, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. (0 to 6 cm thick) 

    A--5 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 cm thick) 

    Bw--13 to 40 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium and few coarse roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (16 to 36 cm thick) 

    Cr--40 to 48 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly coarse sand; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick) 

    R--48 cm; hard granite bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Roegulch soils are primarily used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and understory grazing. The potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, common snowberry, heartleaf arnica, Kinnikinnick, Oregongrape, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Roegulch soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44A.
