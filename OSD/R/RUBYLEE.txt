RUBYLEE SERIES

The Rubylee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Rubylee soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rubylee soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Elevations range from 350 to 800 meters (1,150 to 2,625 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carrizo, Descent and Pintobasin soils. Carrizo soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons and in drainageways, and Descent soils are on fan remnants. Both soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and do not have an argillic horizon. Pintobasin soils are on adjacent fan aprons, are sandy throughout and do not have a diagnostic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low or low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rubylee soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush and burrobush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
