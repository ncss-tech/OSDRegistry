Extent: Small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, North Carolina; 1979

REMARKS:  Roper soils were previously included as a mucky phase of the Hyde series.  However, Hyde soils have an umbric epipedon and do not allow a histic epipedon.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:

Histic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches (Oap and Oa horizons)

Cambic horizon - the zone between depths of 15 to 55 inches (the Bg1, Bg2, and BCg horizons)

Aquic conditions - observed endosaturation to the surface and dominant redox depletions in the zone from 24 to 72 inches (Bg1, Bg2, BCg, 2Cg horizons)

MLRA(s): 153A, 153B

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data from a similar pedon as the site location is contained in A Study of Organic Soils in the Tidewater Region of North Carolina (site No. 3) by Dolman, J. D. and S. W. Buol.  North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station, Tech. Bull. No. 181 December, 1976.
