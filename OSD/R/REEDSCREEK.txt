REEDSCREEK SERIES

The Reedscreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stratified loamy alluvium on floodplains in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Mollic Udifluvents

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 109-Iowa and Missouri Heavy Till Plain; Van Buren County, Iowa subset; about 2 miles southeast of Bonaparte; located about 2,470 feet west and 1,640 feet south of the northeast corner of section 15, T. 68 N., R. 8 W.; USGS Bonaparte, Iowa topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 41 minutes 32 seconds N. and long. 91 degrees 45 minutes 58 seconds W., NAD 83.

Sand content--5 to 80 percent
Rock fragment content--35 to 60 percent--mostly limestone and sandstone pebbles, cobbles and stones, some subhorizons range from 1 to 80 percent
Reaction--slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Most pedons have stratified colors due to sediment deposition related to flooding events

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--stratified loamy alluvium
Landform--floodplains in river valleys
Slope--0 to 5 percent
Elevation--200 to 300 meters above mean sea level
Mean annual air temperature--9 to 12 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--865 to 1,040 millimeters
Frost-free period--175 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bentonsport, Colo, Coppock, Nodaway, and Nordness soils.
Bentonsport--are on higher landscape positions on very steep side slopes on high structural benches, remnants of interfluves, and uplands and are not frequently saturated within a depth of 1.9 meters
Colo--are on lower landscape positions on floodplains and have a mollic epipedon more than 90 centimeters thick
Coppock--are on lower landscape positions on stream terraces, floodplains, footslopes, or alluvial fans and are frequently saturated at the surface to within 0.3 meter of the surface
Nodaway--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Reedscreek soils and have a clay content that averages 18 to 28 percent in the particle-size control section
Nordness--are on higher landscape positions on very steep side slopes on high structural benches, remnants of interfluves, and uplands, and have fractured limestone bedrock within 50 centimeters of the surface

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs within depths of 1.0 to 1.8 meters in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--10.0 to 100 micrometers per second
Flooding--occasionally flooded for brief duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are in permanent pasture or woodland.  Some areas are cultivated.  Corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay are principal crops.  The native vegetation is mixed deciduous trees (oak and hickory) and big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic sections--Dissected till plains
MLRA--Iowa and Missouri Heavy Till Plain (109)
LRR M; along small streams in southeastern Iowa
Extent--small
