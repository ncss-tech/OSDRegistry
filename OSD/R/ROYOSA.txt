ROYOSA SERIES

The Royosa series consists of very deep, excessively or somewhat excessively drained, rapid and very rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian parent material derived from sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Aridic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Royosa loamy sand, juniper-pinyon woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 12 inches thick)

    C--8 to 80 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loamy sand, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; single grained; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Taos County, New Mexico; NW 1/4, SW 1/4, Sec. 36, T. 24 N., R. 9 E.; 105 degrees, 56 minutes, 57 seconds west longitude; 36 degrees, 16 minutes, 34 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The SMCS is usually moist, in all parts, for less than 90 cumulative days from April through October. It is usually dry, in some part, for more than 120 cumulative days during the same period. It is continuously moist in some part November through April, but not moist in all parts for 45 consecutive days from January through April. The period of maximum precipitation is July through October. The soil is driest during May and June. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 48 to 58 degrees F.

Summer temperature: 68 to 72 degrees F.

Reaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.

Other features: some pedons are slightly effervescent.

A horizon -
Hue: 10YR through 5YR.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 to 6.
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, and sandy loam.

C horizon -
Hue: 10YR through 5YR.
Value: 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 3 through 6.
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blueridge, Colfer, Dankworth, Optima, Scoville, and Tancosa.  Tancosa soils are underlain by sandstone at 60 to 80 inches.  Blueridge, Colfer, Dankworth, Optima, and Scoville soils are in LRR-G and LRR-H and are more moist in May and June).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Royosa soils are on characteristic dune-like relief. The soil formed in eolian sands from sandstone. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. Elevations range from 5,600 to 7,750 feet. Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and average annual temperature is about 45 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is typically 100 to 160 days but ranges to 90 days in Arizona and precipitation ranges as high as 18 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Montecito and Vibo soils. Montecito and Vibo soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessive or somewhat excessively drained; very low or low runoff; rapid and very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally for livestock grazing. Principal vegetation consists of an overstory of pinyon pine and oneseed juniper and big sagebrush, blue grama, sand dropseed and ring muhly in the understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico and Northern New Mexico and Northern Arizona.  MLRA 36, LRR-D. This series is of moderate extent.
