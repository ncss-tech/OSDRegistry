RAVOLA SERIES

The Ravola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from calcareous shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  Ravola soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, flood plain steps, and flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ravola loam under cultivation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly plastic; many fine and few coarse roots; common fine and medium pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Ap2--6 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strongly compacted plowpan layer; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak coarse granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common fine and few medium pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    C1--9 to 18 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak very thin platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse and many fine roots; many medium and common fine pores, strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. 

    C2--18 to 45 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and many fine roots; common medium pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual irregular boundary.

    C3--45 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 56 degrees F

Particle-size control section:  
  Clay content: 18 to 27 percent 
  Sand content: Less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand
  Rock fragment content:  0 to 5 percent

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR to 5Y
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture:  Loam, clay loam, very fine sandy loam, silty clay loam or silt loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 25 percent

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture: Stratified loamy sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, clay loam and silt loam

Some pedons have 2C horizons grading into residuum from underlying shale beds.  These horizons occur below a depth of 48_inches and have textures of silty clay and silty clay loam and have chemical properties ranging similar as to those described in the C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Billings series. Billings soils have particle-size control sections with 27 to 35 percent clay, and gypsum nodules below the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Alluvium derived from calcareous shale, siltstone, and sandstone
Landform:  Alluvial fans, flood plain steps, alluvial flats and flood plains
Slopes:  0 to 10 percent
Elevation: 3,900 to 6,500 feet
Precipitation Pattern:  Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.
Mean annual temperature:  45 to 56 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 11 inches
Frost-free period:  110 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Billings, Hunting, Killpack, and Briny (T) soils. Billings soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Hunting soils have redoximorphic features and a water table at depths between 20 and 40 inches. Killpack soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Briny soils have salic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, negligible to medium runoff, moderate or moderately slow permeability.  These soils are subject to rare or occasional very brief or brief flooding following high intensity summer thunderstorms or above average snowmelt events.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated areas are used for growing small grains, corn, sugar beets, alfalfa, and pasture.  Potential vegetation is shadscale, greasewood, Indian ricegrass, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Utah, northwest New Mexico and western Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 28A, 34, 35.  This series is of large extent.
