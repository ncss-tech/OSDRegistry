ROSEDELL SERIES

The Rosedell series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on lakeplains. These soils formed in loess overlying water worked glacial till overlying fine textured lacustrine material. Permeability is moderately slow or slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Rosedell silty clay loam, on a 1 percent slope, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 Ap--0 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate medium angular blocky structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

 2Bg--10 to 30 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam; moderate medium and fine angular blocky structure; firm; common fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) Fe concentrations; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 40 inches thick) 

 3Bkg--30 to 44 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; firm; few fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) Fe concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick) 

 3Cg1--44 to 70 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay; massive; firm; few fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) Fe concentrations; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick) 

 3Cg2--70 to 80 inches; gray (2.5Y 5/1) clay; massive; firm; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Rock County Minnesota. About 7 miles southeast of Jasper; located about 2,620 feet south and 150 feet west of the northeast corner of section 13, T. 104 N., R. 46 W.; USGS Jasper SE topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 48 minutes 46 seconds N. and long. 96 degrees 17 minutes 34 seconds W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches. The depth to free carbonates ranges from 12 to 28 inches. 

The Ap and A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silty clay loam, silt loam or clay loam high in silt. It is slightly acid to neutral. 

The 2Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. 

The 3Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam. 

The 3Cg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is clay or silty clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: The competing series are: Carlow, Chequest, Fults, Kalona, Kings, Moline, Streator, Titus, and Woodbury. Carlow, Chequest, Fults, Kalona, and Titus soils are medium acid to neutral and do not have carbonates in the series control section. Kings and Woodbury soils have carbonates at a depth of greater than 36 inches. Moline soils average 45 to 60 percent clay in the control section. Streator soils have dominantly illite clay in the underlying till and lacustrine sediments. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on lakeplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in silty loess overlying water worked glacial till overlying fine textured lacustrine material. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 1,150 to 1,800 feet above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Moody, Primghar and Marcus soils. Moody and Primghar soils are fine-silty and are found on higher parts of the landscape. Marcus soils are also fine-silty. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: These soils are poorly drained and have moderately slow to slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: All areas are drained and cultivated. Principle crops are corn and soybeans. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie and hydrophytic vegetation. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Minnesota; Very inextensive, at the present time limited to one lake plain in Rock County, Minnesota. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rock County, Minnesota. 2002. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (A horizon); cambic horizon--the zone from 10 to 44 inches (Bg and 2Bkg horizons); calcic horizon-the zone from 30 to 44 inches (2Bkg horizon). 

This soil was previously correlated as Marcus Variant in Rock County, Minnesota. It is in a unique geologic feature resembling a crater on the landscape, however its evolution is not clear at this time.
