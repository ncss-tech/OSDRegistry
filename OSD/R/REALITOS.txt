REALITOS SERIES

The Realitos series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils are in upland depressions and formed in clayey over loamy alluvium derived from the Goliad Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 90 cumulative days in most years during the months of June through August and December through February. The SMCS is also moist for more than 180 cumulative days or more than 90 consecutive days in most years during September through November and March through May. Typic/ustic moisture regime; the SMCS is influenced by runoff water. 

Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 24 degrees C (72 to 75 degrees F)
Depth to slickensides: 13 to 51 cm (5 to 20 in)
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 76 to 191 cm (30 to 75 in)
Depth to calcic horizon: 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in)
Depth to endosaturation: 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 in) for one to three weeks following prolonged rains. Reduction occurs in this zone in 2 to 4 years out of 10 years. 
Does not have aquic conditions in most years.
Depth to episaturation: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in); the soil has episaturation for brief periods following heavy rains.
Redoximorphic features in the form of concentrations and depletions ranging from none to about 5 percent throughout.
