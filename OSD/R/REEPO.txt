REEPO SERIES

The Reepo series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Reepo soils are on structural benches and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Siliceous, mesic Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Reepo fine sand, on a northeast facing, convex-concave, 18 percent slope in fourwing saltbush rangeland at an elevation of 5,800 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few medium and fine roots; few fine and very fine random tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    C1--3 to 18 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; few fine and very fine random tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    C2--18 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; soft, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; few fine and very fine random tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    R--30 to 34 inches; unweathered sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 3.5 miles north of Maeser; located about 1,100 feet south and 1,100 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 6, T. 4 S., R. 21 E., SLBM; Steinaker Reservoir, Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 30 minutes 13 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 35 minutes 56 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture regime:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in the late summer and early fall.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.
Depth to lithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to sandstone
Particle-size control section:  0 to 8 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent sandstone rock fragments


A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  2 to 6
Reaction:  slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma:  4 to 6
Texture:  fine sand, loamy sand, or sand
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 sandstone rock fragments - predominantly gravel sized
Reaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bispen, Mespun, and Santrick series.  

Bispen and Mespun:  do not have a paralithic contact within 40 of the surface.

Santrick soils are neutral in the A horizon and are excessively drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  eolian deposits derived from sandstone
Landform:  structural benches and hillslopes
Slopes:  4 to 25 percent
Elevation: 5,600 to 7,400 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  8 to 12 inches
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clapper, Cliff, Paradox, and Walknolls series.  

Clapper soils are on hillslopes and have a calcic horizon.
Cliff soils occur on drainageways and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.
Paradox soils occur on alluvial flats and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.
Walknolls soils are on hillslopes and are shallow to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, very low to medium runoff, very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat and recreation.  The potential native plant community is Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, galleta, Wyoming big sagebrush, fourwing saltbush, and lanceleaf yellowbrush.  This soil has been correlated to Semidesert Sand (Fourwing Saltbush) - 034XY214UT range site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 30 inches.  (C1 and C2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 30 inches.  (R layer)

The mineralogy was changed from mixed to siliceous in May 1996 bases on lab data from the similar Strell soil.  These soils have similar parent materials.
