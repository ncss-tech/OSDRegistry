ROMNOT SERIES

The Romnot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils occur on stream terraces, fan remnants and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Leptic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Romnot silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(0 to 10 cm thick)

  E--8 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and common fine irregular pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

(10 to 38 cm thick)

  BCyz--102 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 10 percent gravel; 1 percent fine gypsum crystals; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); gradual wavy boundary.
