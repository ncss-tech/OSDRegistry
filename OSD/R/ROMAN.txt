ROMAN SERIES

The Roman series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, footslopes, and ridgetops.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist rocks with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate and moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid to very rapid below.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lolopeak series.  Lolopeak soils are ashy in the volcanic ash mantle.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roman soils are on mountains, footslopes, and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist rocks with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is cold, with cool moist summers and cold wet winters.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches.  The average frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Redraven and Rubycreek (T) soils.  Redraven soils are on north-facing mountains and have a thick volcanic ash mantle.  Rubycreek soils are on similar landscape positions and are loamy-skeletal in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; permeability is moderate and moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid to very rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for woodland, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine, western larch, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of common beargrass, big blueberry, Utah honeysuckle, myrtle pachystima, common yarrow, and pearly everlasting.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana, and northeastern Washington.  This series is not extensive.
