REDLANDS SERIES

The Redlands series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Redlands soils are on fan remnants, mesas, and structural benches. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Redlands loamy fine sand--on a planar surface sloping 2 percent to the northwest at 5,320 feet elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on March 9, 1989, the soil was moist from 2 to 28 inches and otherwise dry throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bacobi (AZ), Frisite (WY), Grazane (AZ), Griffy (WY), Kiki (NM), Neiber (WY), Papoose (NV), Saddle (WY), and Tijeras (NM) series. Bacobi, Grazane, Kiki, Neiber, and Saddle soils are moderately deep to bedrock. In addition, Neiber and Saddle have a mean annual soil temperature less than 53 degrees F. Frisite and Griffy soils are less than 40 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and have mean annual soil temperature of less than 53 degrees F. Papoose soils are 20 inches or less deep to the base of the argillic horizon and are more moist in the winter and drier in the summer. Tijeras soils are 24 inches or less deep to the base of the argillic horizon and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redlands soils are on fan remnants, mesas, and structural benches. They formed in Quaternary eolian material loess deposits weathered from Triassic age redbeds. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aneth, Bluechief, Mack, Mariano, and Sogzie soils. Aneth soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on hummocky, eolian mantled areas. Bluechief soils are moderately deep, do not have argillic horizons, and occur on benches and fan remnants. Mack soils are fine-loamy, have calcic horizons, and occur on fan remnants and mesas. Mariano soils are loamy-skeletal, have strong calcic horizons, and occur on fan remnants. Sogzie soils are coarse-loamy, have calcic horizons, and occur on mesas, undulating plateaus, and dipslopes of cuestas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Redlands soils are used for livestock grazing. Present vegetation is galleta, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Redlands soils occur in southeastern Utah, southwestern Colorado, and northeastern Arizona. MLRA 35, LRR-D. Redlands soils are moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: The series was established in the Grand Junction Area, Mesa County, Colorado, 1948. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 42 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

The series type location was moved to the Shiprock Soil Survey area in June 2004 because the soil in the Grand Junction Area was correlated to another series.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location was sampled by the BIA lab in Gallup, NM as soil survey sample number S89NM-045-3. Another pedon was sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as sample number S86AZ-017-011.
