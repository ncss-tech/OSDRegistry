REDLIGHT SERIES

The Redlight series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from thick bedded limestone bedrock. Redlight soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F. (21 degrees C) and the mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches (279 mm).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Redlight very gravelly coarse sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Redford (TX) series. Redford soils have 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, are on fan remnants and formed from fanglomerate.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redlight soils are on limestone hills and mountains at elevations of 3,000 to 4,000 feet (914 to 1,219 m). Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone bedrock. The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loamy earth, containing many coarse fragments. The underlying rocks are thick bedded limestone. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches (254 to 330 mm).  The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F. (20 to 22 degrees C).  The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Corazones (TX), Ojinaga (TX) and Terlingua (TX) soils.  Corazones soils are very deep and occur on alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmont slopes. Ojinaga soils have petrocalcic horizons and occur on alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmont slopes. Terlingua soils do not have a calcic horizon and occur on similar positions over igneous bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Surface runoff is low to medium on 5 to 10 percent slopes, medium on 10 to 20 percent slopes and high on 20 to 65 percent slopes. Permeability is moderately rapid to moderate over very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is mostly chino grama, black grama, creosote bush, ocotillo, prickly pear, candelilla, and leatherstem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West Texas. MLRA 42. The series is of minor extent.
