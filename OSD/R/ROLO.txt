ROLO SERIES

The Rolo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over weathered quartz diorite residuum.  They are on mountain side slopes. Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 10 to 35 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bechtel(T), Keeler(T) and Sly(T) series. Bechtel soils are deep to a paralithic contact.  Keeler and Sly soils do not have 2E/Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rolo soils are on mountain side slopes at elevations of 3,200 to 3,500 feet with slopes of 10 to 35 percent. These soils formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and loess over material weathered from quartz diorite. The average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 38 to 42 inches.  The frost free season is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lado(T), Lewark(T), Broquito(T), and Broshell(T) series. Lado soils are on concave mountain side slopes and have thick volcanic ash mantles. Lewark soils are on gentle slightly concave south-facing toe slopes and swales and have a fragipan at 20 to 30 inches. Broquito soils are on steep smooth mountain side slopes and Broshell soils are on steep convex mountain side slopes and both soils have volcanic ash mantles.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western larch and Douglas-fir with an understory of queencup beadlily, coolwort foamflower, princes pine, western goldthread, bunchberry dogwood, and beargrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Idaho. Rolo soils are not extensive.
