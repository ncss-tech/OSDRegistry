REEF SERIES

The Reef series consist of very shallow and shallow somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils on hillslopes, canyon sideslopes, mountain slopes, ridge tops, structural benches, mesas, and cuestas. They formed in alluvium, residuum and colluvium from sandstone. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 10 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Reef very channery loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very channery loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine platy parting to moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine, and common fine and medium pores; violently effervescent; 40 percent angular channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

 C--3 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very channery loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine pores; violently effervescent; 45 percent angular channers and 10 percent flagstones; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick)

 R--8 inches; Timpoweap member sandstone bedrock of the Moenkopi.

TYPE LOCATION: Garfield County, Utah; Capitol Reef National Park; south side of the Burr Trail; 800 feet west and 500 feet south of the NE corner of section 18, T. 34S., R. 8E, Wagon Box Mesa Quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 51 minutes 27 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 3 minutes 28 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Andanada (NM), Daklos (UT), Ednagrey (NV), Hillburn (UT), Meriwhitica (AZ), Nonip (UT), Redsun (WY), Skos (UT), Sunup (WY), Teesto (AZ), and Windcomb (UT) Series. Andanada, Nonip, Skos, Sunup, and Teesto soils' clay content is greater than 18 percent. Ednagrey and Daklos soils have a hue of 10YR. Meriwhitica soils have a visible secondary calcium carbonate. Windcomb soils average less than 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the profile. Redsun and Windcomb soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Hillburn soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Reef soils are on cuestas, hillslopes, canyon sideslopes, structural benches, mountain slopes and ridge tops at elevations of 4,040 to 7,010 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in alluvium, residuum, and colluvium from limestone, siltstone, or sandstone of the Timpoweap member of the Moekopie formation. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches. The wettest month is August and the driest month is June. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sunup, Redbank and Mussentuchit soils. Sunup soils have hue of 7.5YR through 5Y and occur on similar landscapes. The Redbank soils are very deep and occur on stream terraces. The Mussentuchit soils have horizons of secondary gypsum accumulation and are moderately deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, woodland, recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is Utah juniper, pinyon, Mormon-tea, desert holly, galleta and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: south central Utah and northern Arizona. The series is not extensive. MLRA is 35.
