RENOVA SERIES

The Renova series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fillmore County, Minnesota, 1954

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 18 to 68 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (A, E, Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Btk, 2BC1 and 2BC2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (A and E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 18 to 102 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Btk horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
