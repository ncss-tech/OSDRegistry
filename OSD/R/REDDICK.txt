REDDICK SERIES

The Reddick series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loamy water-laid sediments over till or lacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Reddick clay loam - on a nearly level area in a cultivated field at an elevation of 200 meters (657 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clyde, Faxon, Kossuth, Letri, Marengo, Mound Creek, Selma, Selmass, Tripoli, Webster, and Wolcott series. Clyde, Kossuth, Letri, Marengo, Selma, Selmass, Tripoli, Webster, and Wolcott soils contain more than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Faxon and Mound Creek soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Reddick soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loamy water-laid sediments over till or lacustrine sediments. These soils are on nearly level to slightly undulating topography. Slope gradient is usually less than 1 percent but ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 155 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 156 to 285 meters (512 to 935 feet) above sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Andres, Elliott, Mokena, and Symerton soils. The somewhat poorly drained Andres soils and moderately well drained Symerton soils form a hydro-sequence with the Reddick soils and are on higher landform positions. Elliott and Mokena soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on slightly higher landform positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Where drained, an intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loamy material and moderately low or moderately high (0.14 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the till or lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and slow or very slow in the till or lacustrine sediments.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are drained and are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grains, and meadow are the principal crops. Native vegetation is swamp grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern and eastern Illinois and northwestern Indiana. The series is of moderate extent in MLRAs 98, 110, and 111C with about 110,720 acres mapped. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kankakee County, Illinois, 1975. 

REMARKS: SDJR - MLRA 110 - Reddick clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes project noted a study of those areas of Reddick correlated in MLRA 111C. The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether these soils are located within an isolated area of the Lake Michigan lobe where silty clay loam textured till is dominant.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
mollic epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (13 inches) (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon: 33 to 119 cm (13 to 47 inches) (Bg, Btg1, Btg2, and 2Btg3 horizons);
lithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 81 cm (32 inches) (contact between the Btg2 and 2Btg3 horizons);
aquic moisture regime: chroma of 1 in the matrix and redoximorphic features present in the zone from 33 to 152 cm (13 to 60 inches) (Bg, Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, and 2Cg horizons).
