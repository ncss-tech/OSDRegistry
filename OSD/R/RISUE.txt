RISUE SERIES

The Risue series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous rocks.  Risue soils are on dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to l5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, mesic, shallow Abruptic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:   Risue extremely stony loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely stony loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; 70 percent gravel, cobbles and stones; neutral (pH 6.8);  abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt1--3 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few medium and fine and common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; continuous thin clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt2--10 to 36 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few medium and fine, and common very fine roots; few fine and many very fine tubular pores; continuous pressure cutans on ped faces; continuous thin clay films lining pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (20 to 36 cm thick)

    Btk--36 to 41 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films lining pores; few fine masses of carbonate; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 13 cm thick)

    Bqkm1--41 to 84 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) abrupt smooth boundary.  (25 to 60 cm thick)

    Bqkm2--84 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) alternating layers of strongly and weakly silica cemented very gravelly sandy loam; very hard; firm and very firm; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada; 4 1/2 miles west of Silver Springs; 400 feet north and 500 feet east of the southwest corner of section 16, T. l8 N., R. 24 E.;  USGS Stockton Well, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 25 minutes 12 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 18 minutes 13 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.4200000 latitude, -119.3025000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Moist in winter and spring; dry in summer and fall; typic aridic soil moisture regime.  
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to indurated duripan: 25 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 through 6 dry or moist.
Chroma: 3 through 5.
Texture: Clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or gravelly clay.
Structure: Angular blocky or prismatic.
Reaction: Neutral increasing to moderately alkaline in the lower subhorizon in some pedons.

Bqkm horizons
Consistence: Indurated in the upper 38 to 60 cm.  Noncemented to strongly silica cemented below.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deefan and Fuegosta series.  

Deefan soils have a moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline A horizon and a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C. Fuegosta soils are moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Risue soils are on old dissected fans with plane or convex surfaces at elevations of 1,340 to 1,830 meters.  Slopes are 0 to l5 percent.  They formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous rocks.  Mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm.  The frost-free season is l00 to l30 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Celeton, Cleaver, Theon, and Vylock soils.  Celeton soils lack an argillic horizon.  Cleaver soils have a loamy argillic horizon and lack an abrupt texture boundary.  Theon soils are shallow to bedrock.  Vylock soils lack an indurated duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Homesite development is likely in the future.  The vegetation is principally Bailey greasewood, shadscale, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 27.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Douglas County Area, Nevada, l98l.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - From the surface to 3 cm (A horizon).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 41 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons). 
Indurated duripan - The zone from 41 to 84 cm (Bqkm1 horizon). 
Abruptic feature - Abrupt clay increase between the A and Bt1 horizon at 3 cm. 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 3 to 41 cm Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
This series was proposed in Antelope Valley, Mono County, California. The type and responsibility for the series is transferred from California to Nevada.  The concept of the series is the same.
