RALEIGH SERIES

The Raleigh series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in materials derived from weathered granitic rocks.  Raleigh soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, micaceous, shallow Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Raleigh very gravelly sandy loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0e--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed needles and twigs.

    A--1 to 2 inch; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky; 45 percent angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky; common visible mica as fine and medium sized sand particles; 45 percent angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    BC--6 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky; common visible mica as fine and medium sized sand particles; 50 percent angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    C--9 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown to dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky; common visible mica as fine and medium sized sand particles; 75 percent angular pebbles; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--15 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) weathered Pike's Peak granite, brown to dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist.

TYPE LOCATION:  Park County, Colorado; about 1 mile northwest and 1/4 mile west of Pine Junction; 1,750 feet west and 650 feet north of the southeast corner of Sec. 35, T. 6 S., R. 72 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture regime: Ustic, dry in parts of the moisture control section 50 to 70 cumulative days
Mean annual soil temperature: 41 to 44 degrees F. at 50cm.
Mean annual summer soil temperature: less than 47 degrees F.
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 5 to 12 inches from mineral soil surface
Depth to the paralithic contact:  10 to 20 inches
The particle size control section: 35 to 85 percent angular rock fragments, mainly 1/8 to 1 inch diameter
Clay percentage in the particle size control section: 8 to 18 percent

A horizon(s):  
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sandy loam, coarse sandy loam
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

Bw horizon:  
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 through 6, 2 through 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sandy loam, coarse sandy loam
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

C horizon:  
Value: 4 through 7, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma: 3 through 5
Texture: sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Herbman series.  Herbman soils have a mean summer soil temperature of 47 degrees F or greater and contain coarse fragments that are typically larger, ranging in size from 1/8 to 10 inch in diameter.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  very gravelly material weathered from granitic rock principally from Pike's Peak granite
Landform:  mountain slopes and ridges
Slopes:  0 to 70 percent
Elevation:  6,500 to 10,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  41 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  17 to 22 inches
Frost-free period:  35 to 75 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Resort, Legault, Ohman and Sphinx soils. Resort and Sphinx soils have frigid temperatures. Legault soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Ohman are moderately deep and contain lamallae in the subsoils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; rapid runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are used for woodland, recreation, wildlife habitat, and community development.  Native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine on southerly aspects and Rocky Mountain Douglas-Fir and lodgepole pine on northerly aspects.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of north central Colorado in Pike's Peak granite area.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Golden Area Soil Survey, Park County, Colorado, 1980.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic and Other features: Mica content may range from 25 to 55 percent by grain count in the fine sand fraction 
Mollic epipedon: 1 to 6 inches (A and Bw)
Paralithic contact: 15 inches (Cr)

Taxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
