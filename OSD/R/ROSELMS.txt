ROSELMS SERIES

The Roselms series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey lacustrine sediments. These soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, illitic, mesic Aeric Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Roselms silty clay, on a 2 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 215 meters (705 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Related soils are the Kingsbury series. Kingsbury soils have endosaturation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roselms soils are on slightly elevated areas that have a convex surface or are on gently sloping areas along drainageways. They are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in very fine-textured, calcareous lacustrine material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 175 to 244 meters (575 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broughton and Paulding soils in a toposequence with Roselms soils and the Defiance and Wabasha soils. The moderately well drained Broughton soils are on gently sloping to steep dissected areas along drainageways. The very poorly drained Paulding soils are on broad, nearly level areas of the lake plain. Defiance and Wabasha soils are on nearby flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 30 cm (0.5 to 1.0 foot) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: More than half of the Roselms soils have been cleared for cultivation with soybeans, small grain, some corn, and hay as principal crops. Native vegetation is hardwood forest with white oak, pin oak, and slippery elm as dominant species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan; MLRAs 98 and 99. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Paulding County, Ohio, 1957.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 81 cm (Bt, Btg horizons).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 23 cm.

Additional work is needed to determine if the clay and silty clay surface phases of Roselms should be in the Aeric Vertic subgroup. The previously correlated surface phases of fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam will need studied during update activities. It is likely that they will meet the criteria for an abrupt textural change and be reclassified into the Albaqualfs.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for pedons DF-33 (the typical pedon), DF-25, DF-31, PD-7, PD-9, PD-42, and WL-13. This data should be evaluated in the future to determine if it supports the current series concept.
