RASSET SERIES

The Rasset series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash. These soils are on nearly level to convex slopes on outwash plains, valley trains, and moraines and on treads and risers of strath terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.
