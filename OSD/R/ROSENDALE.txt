ROSENDALE SERIES

The Rosendale series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum from shale with or without a thin mantle of loess or thin layer of interbedded limestone, calcareous shale is at depths between 100 and 150 centimeters. These soils are on side slopes and ridges on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Eutrudepts

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Andrew County, Missouri, 1986.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (A horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 centimeters to 109 centimeters; (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, Bw4, Bw5 and BC horizons);
paralithic contact--the contact with shale at a depth of 140 centimeters (Cr horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
