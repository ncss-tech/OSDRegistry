RED POINT SERIES

The Red Point series consist of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum from interbedded sandstone and shale. Red Point soils are on eroded fan remnants and pediments. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

   Cr--104 to 150 cm; weakly cemented, calcareous sandstone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - eroded fan remnants and pediments
Elevation - 1,085 - 1,600 meters
Slope - 3 to 15 percent slopes
Parent material - slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum
Mean annual precipitation - 127 to 229 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 6 to 8 degrees C
Frost-free period - 110 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Red Point soils are generally used as rangeland; however, there are isolated areas of irrigated hayland and cropland. Principle native plants are rhizomatous wheatgrasses, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, prairie Junegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Wyoming big sagebrush. As this site deteriorates blue grama and threadleaf sedge become the dominate vegetation, with only traces of the reference species persisting.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Red Point soils are of small extent in northwestern Wyoming. MLRA 32.
