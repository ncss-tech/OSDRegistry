MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, North Carolina, 1916.

REMARKS:  The Gertie series has been established by correlation in City of Chesapeake, Virginia 2004 to represent these soils in the lower Coastal Plain. Roanoke soils are restricted to stream terraces of the Piedmont and upper and middle Coastal Plain.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon).
b.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 40 inches (Btg horizon).
