RICREST SERIES

The Ricrest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from mixed sources but dominantly limestone and quartzite.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on foothills and mountain ridges and slopes and have slopes of 8 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ricrest stony loam - on a 32 percent north-facing mountain slope.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) (very dark grayish brown, 10YR 3/2) crushed) stony loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; about 5 percent stones and cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 9 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) (dark gray, 10YR 4/1 crushed) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; few stones and cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--9 to 15 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) light clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky, plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw2--15 to 23 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) (gray, 10YR 5/1 crushed) light clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 10 percent limestone gravel, otherwise noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--23 to 27 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) light clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 15 percent limestone gravel; violently effervescent and few spots of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk2--27 to 40 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; about 25 percent gray (10YR 5/1) limestone gravel; slightly lime-coated on lower side; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk3--40 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; about 40 percent gray limestone gravel, slightly lime-coated on lower half; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.  The Pavohroo series is similar but is cryic and lacks a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ricrest soils are on foothills, mountainsides, and ridges.  Slopes range from 8 to 80 percent.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium from mixed sources but dominantly quartzite and limestone.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 39 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 50 to 100 days.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cedarhill, Hymas, Ridgecrest, and Wahtigup soils.  Cedarhill soils are loamy-skeletal and are calcareous to the surface.  Hymas soils have limestone bedrock within 20 inches of the surface.  Ridgecrest soils are loamy-skeletal and are moderately deep.  Wahtigup soils are calcareous to the surface and are not pachic.  Cedarhill soils are on south-facing mountain slopes.  Hymas soils are on ridges.  Ridgecrest soils are on convex mountain slopes.  Wahtigup soils are on concave south-facing mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium through very rapid runoff; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This Ricrest soil is used mainly for rangeland.  The potential natural vegetation is mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  This series is moderately extensive.
