RUSBACH SERIES

The Rusbach series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on mountains and canyons.  Slopes are 40 to 80 percent. They formed in colluvium derived from tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Lamellic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rusbach cobbly sandy loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     0i--2 inches to 0;  litter of pine needles.

     E1--0 to 14 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) cobbly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 10 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

     E2--14 to 23 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) cobbly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 10 percent pebbles and 20 percent cobbles; medium acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

     Bw1--23 to 46 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) very cobbly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few thin sandy loam lamellae; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine, fine and few medium vesicular pores; 20 percent pebbles and 25 percent cobbles; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (12 to 30 inches thick)

     Bw2--46 to 70 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few thin sandy loam lamellae; common fine and few medium roots; common very fine, fine and few medium vesicular pores; 20 percent pebbles and 25 percent cobbles; medium acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sandoval County, New Mexico; about 7 miles north and 5 miles west of Los Alamos, New Mexico; New Mexico state plane coordinates 1,810,700 feet north and 457,000 east; 106 degrees, 23 minutes, 44 seconds west longitude and 35 degrees, 58 minutes, 34 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is moist in at least some part every month, except June.

Annual Soil Temperature:  37 to 40 degrees F.

Summer Soil Temperature:  44 to 47 degrees F.

Rock fragments:  35 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section.  Mainly cobble size fragments of tuff.

A thin A horizon may or may not be present.

E horizon - Hue: 7.5YR or 10 YR

Value:  7 or 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist

Chroma: 1 through 4

Fine earth fraction:  loamy sand or sandy loam

Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mostly cobbles

Bw horizon - Hue:  10YR  or 7.5YR

Value:  5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist

Chroma:  2 through 4

Rock fragments:  35 to 70 percent, mostly cobbles of tuff.

Reaction:  Medium acid or strongly acid in the B horizon

Lamellae: Sandy loam lamellae range from a few thin (3 to 5 mm thick) lamellae, up to lamellae with a thickness of 1 to 2 cm and a combined thickness of 3 to 4 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Comad(MT) series.  Comad soils are medium acid through neutral and contain fragments of granite and quartzite.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rusbach soils are on mountains and canyons.  Slopes range from 40 to 80 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium derived from tuff.  Elevations are 8600 to 10,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 30 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 39 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Redondo and Chrishall soils.  The Redondo soils have an argillic horizon and Chrishall soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very rapid runoff, and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for woodland.  The present vegetation is Engelmann spruce with an understory of American vetch, wild strawberry, vaccinium, mountain brome, and cliff jamesia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This soil occurs in north-central New Mexico and is of small extent.
