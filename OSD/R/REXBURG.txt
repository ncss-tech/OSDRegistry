REXBURG SERIES

The Rexburg series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess.  They are on loess covered fan terraces, foothills, and basalt plains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rexburg silt loam, grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very thin platy structure in upper 2 inches, weak very fine and fine granular structure in the lower part; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    AB--7 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--12 to 17 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many uncoated silt grains on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.9); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw2--17 to 25 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many uncoated silt grains on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk1--25 to 40 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common cicada krotovinas; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 22 inches thick)

    Bk2--40 to 50 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few cicada krotovinas; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); diffuse wavy boundary.  (8 to 22 inches thick)

    C--50 to 75 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

TYPE LOCATION:  Bingham County, Idaho; about 22 miles east and 5 miles south of Blackfoot; 1,520 feet north and 1,320 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 5, T.4S., R.39E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature - 40 to 47 degrees F
Particle-size control section - 8 to 18 percent clay
Thickness of the mollic epipedon - 12 to 20 inches
Depth to the calcic horizon - 18 to 35 inches

A horizon
Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Reaction - slightly acid to mildly alkaline

Bw horizon
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Reaction - neutral to moderately alkaline

Bk horizon
Value - 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist
Reaction - slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline
Calcium carbonate equivalent - 15 to 30 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gird and Ririe series.  Ririe soils lack a cambic horizon and the depth to calcic horizon of 7 to 16 inches.  Gird soils have 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate in the calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rexburg soils are on loess covered fan terraces, foothills, and basalt plains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 70 to 110 days.  Elevation is 4,600 to 7,250 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bancroft, Lanoak, Newdale, and the competing Ririe series.  Bancroft soils have an argillic horizon and are fine-silty.  Lanoak soils are pachic and are fine-silty.  Newdale soils have a calcic horizon within 18 inches of the surface.  Bancroft and Lanoak soils are on north and east-facing slopes.   Newdale and Ririe soils are on south-facing slopes when associated with Rexburg.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is slow to very rapid; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This Rexburg soil is used mainly for nonirrigated and irrigated cropland.  The potential natural vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The series is extensive.
