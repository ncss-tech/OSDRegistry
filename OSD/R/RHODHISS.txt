SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Burke County, North Carolina; 2003.

REMARKS: The Rhodhiss series was previously mapped with the Rion series. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Rhodhiss series as a mesic counterpart to the Rion series.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 25 inches (Bt horizons)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
