REPKIE SERIES 

The Repkie series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from fine and coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges, hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 25 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Repkie very gravelly coarse sandy loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 cm; partially decomposed needles, twigs and leaves 

    A--2 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine pores; 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm inches thick) 

    E/Bw--20 to 48 cm; E part (70 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; Bw part (30 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 64 cm thick) 

    Bw--48 to 109 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, and few fine and medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6). (15 to 76 cm thick) 

    BC--109 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6).
