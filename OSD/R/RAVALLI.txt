RAVALLI SERIES

The Ravalli series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash or slope alluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants and outwash fans. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.
