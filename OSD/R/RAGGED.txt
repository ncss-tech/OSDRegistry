RAGGED SERIES

The Ragged series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium mixed with glacial drift and minor amounts of volcanic ash on debris cones, terraces, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,100 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ragged gravelly ashy loamy sand, on a debris cone landform with a south facing slope of 8 percent at 520 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation.  When described on July 10, 2007 the soil was slightly moist throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Oi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; very abrupt wavy boundary.

	Oe--2 to 5 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; many very fine, fine, and medium, and common coarse roots; very abrupt wavy boundary.

	Bw1--5 to 20 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly ashy loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 5 percent fine gravel and 10 percent medium and coarse gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt wavy boundary.

	Bw2--20 to 34 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse and few very coarse roots; 5 percent fine gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear irregular boundary.

	2C--34 to 150 cm; variegated colors,  extremely cobbly sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 15 percent fine gravel, 15 percent medium and coarse gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  North Cascades National Park, Whatcom County, Washington; Section 5, T38N, R13E Willamette Meridian;  Mount Prophet, Washington USGS quadrangle; 48 degrees, 48 minutes, 15 seconds north latitude and 121 degrees, 8 minutes, 41 seconds west longitude; NAD83; UTM 636232 meters E, 5407352 meters N, zone 10N. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depths to diagnostic horizons and features start from the mineral soil surface.

Mean annual soil temperature:  6 to 8 degrees C.  Frigid soil temperature regime.
Soil moisture control section:  dry for less than 45 consecutive days from June to October.  Udic soil moisture regime.
Reaction:  very strongly acid to slightly acid
Depth to lithologic discontinuity:  30 to 100 centimeters

Bw horizons:
Hue -10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y
Value - 2 to 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry
Chroma - 2 to 4 moist or dry
Fine earth texture - SL, COSL, LS
Rock fragments - 5 to 60 percent total
		     0 to 25 percent fine gravel
		     5 to 25 percent medium and coarse gravel

BC horizons are sometimes present, representing a more gradual transition to the lithologic discontinuity.  Thickness ranges from 30 to 50 centimeters, textures of SL, COSL or LS, reaction of strongly acid to moderately acid, hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, values 3 to 5 moist and chromas 3 to 6 moist.  

C horizons:
Hue - 2.5Y or variegated
Value - 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry
Chroma - 3 to 6 moist or dry
Texture - LCOS or S
Rock fragments - 35 to 80 percent

		       0 to 15 percent stones 
Clay content - 0 to 5 percent
Volcanic glass - 0 to 5 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ragged soils are on debris cones, terraces, and alluvial fans at elevations of 380 to 700 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium mixed with glacial drift and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  The climate is mild; with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,500 to 2,540 millimeters and mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 10 degrees C. Frost free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cosho, Sonnyboy (T), and Tricouni series.  Cosho soils have andic soil properties to a depth of greater than 36 centimeters and form on more stable portions of the same landforms.  Sonnyboy soils have albic and spodic horizons and form on older terraces and the most stable portions of debris cones.  Tricouni soils have andic soil properties to a depth greater than 18 cm and form on less active portions of terraces and debris cones.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained soils, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is western hemlock, Douglas-fir,, western redcedar, and grand fir with an understory of Cascade Oregongrape, vine maple, prince's pine, red huckleberry, twin flower, claspleaf twistedstalk, Pacific trillium, pink wintergreen, and sword fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of moderate extent.
