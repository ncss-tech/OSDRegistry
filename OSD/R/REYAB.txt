REYAB SERIES

The Reyab series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone.  Reyab soils are on flood plains, alluvial bottoms, terraces, and fan aprons and inset fans on fan piedmonts with slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Reyab loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium platy in the upper part and weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure in the lower part; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; lime disseminated; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.   (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--4 to 12 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick)

    Bw2--12 to 25 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick)

    C--25 to 80 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Otero County, New Mexico; on Otero Mesa about 11.8 miles south on County Road 506 from the guard station at the east gate of the McGregor Missile Range and 250 feet west of the road; NW1/4 NW1/4 section 15, T.24 S., R.13 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is usually dry in all parts less than three-fourths of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Ustic aridic moisture regime.  

Thickness of solum is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is strongly effervescent throughout.

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 to 7, dry or moist 
Chroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist
Texture:  loam, silt loam, silty clay loam

Bw horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5 to 7, dry or moist
Chroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist  
Texture:  silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam

C horizon

Chroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist  
Texture:  silt loam, silty clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alama (NM) and Hodgins (TX) series.  Alama soils have Bk horizons in which lime is segregated.  Also, Alama soils typically have 5YR hue and range from 2.5YR through 7.5YR in all horizons. In addition, Alama soils are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys (MLRA 70) and are moist in May and June.  Hodgins soils have sola thicker than 40 inches and contain Bk horizon.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: alluvium dominantly from limestone
Landform: flood plains, fan aprons and inset fans on fan piedmonts, alluvial bottoms, terraces, and fans of broad uplands
Slope:  0 to 5 percent
Mean annual temperature: 58 to 64 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 16 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 140 to 230 days
Elevation: 4,000 to 6,000 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Philder and Jerag soils.  Philder soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths of less than 20 inches.  Jerag soils have argillic horizons and have petrocalcic horizons at depths of less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent, medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is blue grama, threeawn, burrograss, vine mesquite, cholla, and yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 42.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Otero County (Otero Soil Survey Area), New Mexico, 1976.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bw1, Bw2, and C horizons)

Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 4 inches. (A horizon)

Cambic horizon: The zone from 4 to 25 inches. (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
