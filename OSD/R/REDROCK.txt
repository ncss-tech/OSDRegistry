REDROCK SERIES

The Redrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  These soils are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Redrock clay loam, on a southwest-facing 3 percent slope under irrigated pasture at an elevation of 7015 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 10 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--10 to 30 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) clay loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 3 percent pebbles, 2 percent cobbles; many visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as finely divided marl-like forms; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bk2--30 to 60 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent pebbles; common visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).  (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 48 to 54 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION:  Montrose County, Colorado; located about 1320 feet east and 400 feet north of the center of section 15, T. 49N., R. 8 W.; USGS Red Rock Canyon topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees, 30 minutes, 47 seconds north and longitude 107 degrees, 45 minutes, 09 seconds west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.

Mean summer soil temperature:  55 to 57 degrees F.
Depth to cambic:  2 to 6 inches
Depth to calcic:  9 to 16 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  28 to 35 percent clay with 0 to 10 percent rock fragments
A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture:  loam or clay loam with 22 to 32 percent clay
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture:  loam or clay loam with 22 to 32 percent clay
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture:  loam or clay loam with 25 to 34 percent clay
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 30 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  Whitesage series.  Whitesage soils have less that 28 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources
Landform: alluvial fans and valley side slopes
Slope: 2 to 10 percent
Elevation: 6,800 to 7,800 feet
Mean annual precipitation:  13 to 16 inches
Mean annual temperature:  42 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  90 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  There are the Blanyon and Bostwick soils.  Blanyon soils have a fine-textured argillic horizon and do not have a calcic horizon.  The Bostwick soils have a mollic epipedon, an argillic horizon, and do not have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for irrigated hay and pasture, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is western wheatgrass, muttongrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, and black sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  The series is of minor extent.  MLRA 48A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Montrose County, Colorado, Ridgway Soil Survey Area, 1994.  The name is taken from a canyon and a USGS topographical quadrangle name.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include an ochric horizon from 0 to 3 inches, a cambic horizon from 3 to 10 inches, and a calcic horizon from 10 to 60 inches.

The classification was changed from Haplocalcidic Ustochrepts to Aridic Calciustepts 1/99.
