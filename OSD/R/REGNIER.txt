REGNIER SERIES

The Regnier series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale, siltstone, or sandstone of the Santa Rosa and Chinle Formation of Triassic age.  These nearly level to very steep soils are mainly on convex, low ridgetops and side slopes of erosional plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Regnier clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine granular structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 30 cm)

    C--23 to 46 cm (9 to 18 in); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm)

    Cr--46 to 91 cm (18 to 36 in); stratified shale and siltstone; very few fine and very fine roots following natural cleavage planes through the shale; strongly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: De Baca County, New Mexico; about 300 feet west and 1,500 feet north of the southeast corner, sec. 19, R. 26 E., T. 6 N.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: An aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 180 days to 270 days, cumulative, in normal years.  The period of maximum precipitation is May through October.
Soil Temperature: 15 to 17 degrees C (59 to 63 degrees F).
Depth to paralithic contact: 30 to 50 cm (12 to 20 in).

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 6, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 8
Texture: loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or their gravelly counterparts.
Effervescence: slight to violently
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline
Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 25 percent pebbles

C horizon, or BCk horizon (where present)
Hue: 2.5YR to 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 to 8
Textures: loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam
Effervescence: slight to violently
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent pebbles
Calcium carbonate: none to few in the form of coatings, films, and threads

Cr horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 5YR
Value: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Effervescence: none to violently
Reaction: slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline
Platy beds of stratified shale and siltstone

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Burson (TX) series.  Similar soils are the Lacoca series.
Burson series: are less than 30 cm deep to a paralithic contact and receive more precipitation during the spring.
Lacoca series: have a lithic contact with sandstone within 50 cm of the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  residuum and colluvium derived from shale, sandstone and siltstone of the Santa Rosa, Chinle, and Dockum Formation.
Landform: mainly on convex, low ridgetops and side slopes of erosional plains.
Slope:  0 to 80 percent
Mean annual temperature: 15 to 17 degrees C (58 to 60 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 356 to 432 mm (12 to 15 in)
Frost-free period: 180 to 200 days
Elevation:  1,160 to 1,620 meters (3,800 to 5,300 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hassell and the similar Lacoca soils.
Hassell soils: have well developed argillic horizons, are moderately deep to shale, and are on the same landscape positions.
Lacoca soils: are on the same landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent, medium on 1 to 5, high on 5 to 20 percent slopes and very high on slopes more than 20 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of blue grama, alkali sacaton, tobosa and sideoats grama.  The ecological site is Red Shale (R070XB071NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Upper Pecos River Valley (MLRA 70B in LRR G) of east-central New Mexico.  The series is moderately extensive.
