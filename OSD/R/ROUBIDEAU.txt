ROUBIDEAU SERIES

The Roubideau series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone.  Roubideau soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Roubideau loam in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots throughout; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

     A2--2 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots throughout; few medium discontinuous tubular pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

     Bt1--6 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; few faint patchy clay films on faces of peds and in pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

     Bt2--12 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine discontinuous tubular pores; few faint patchy clay films on faces of peds and in pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

     Bt3--23 to 36 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots throughout; few very fine vesicular pores and few fine discontinuous tubular pores; common faint continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (7.4); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt4--36 to 38 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) channery loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium roots throughout; common faint continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; noneffervescent; 5 percent sandstone gravel and 15 percent sandstone channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. 

    2R--38 inches;  brownish yellow Cliffhouse sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Montezuma County, Colorado; about 50 feet west of the Y intersection on Long Mesa, Mesa Verde National Park; about 3,200 feet north and 100 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 31, T. 35 N., R 15 W.

Mean annual soil temperature: 52 degrees F
Depth to lithic contact: 20 to 40 inches to hard sandstone

Particle-size control section:
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 (3 to 6 moist)
Chroma: 1 to 4

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Altega, Amal, Buick, Chita, Elpedro, Keiser, Klinedraw, Moncha, Oshoto, Pulpit, Sharps, Verde, Wetherill, and Wiley series.  Altega, Amal, Buick, Chita, Elpedro, Keiser, Oshoto, Moncha, Wetherill, and Wiley soils are very deep.  Klinedraw and Sharps soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Pulpit soils contain visible secondary carbonates in the lower part of the solum. Verde soils have a fragipan-like horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian material derived from sandstone
Landform: mesas
Slopes: 1 to 6 percent
Elevation: 6,800 to 7,800 feet
Mean annual temperature: 47 to 50 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 19 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer. 
Frost-free period: 130 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Morefield and Arabrab series.  All soils are found in the same area.  Morefield soils are very deep and Arabrab soils are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, low or medium runoff, moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is pinyon, juniper, shrubs, junegrass, and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of small extent.
