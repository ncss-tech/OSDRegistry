TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Rosie silt loam - on a slope of 75 percent under Alaska sage and prickly rose at 600 feet elevation. (All colors are for moist soil unless noted)

       A--0 to 12 inches, (0 to 30 cm); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) and brown(7.5YR 4/3); silt loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; 5 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.

Percent clay in the loess mantle: 3 to 14 percent
Percent clay in the loess mixed with residuum substratum: 3 to 10 percent
Total coarse fragments in the loess mantle: 0 to 7 percent
Total coarse fragments in the loess mixed with residuum substratum: 15 to 75 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing soils in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess over residuum weathered from schist
Landform: back slopes and shoulders of hills
Slope: 45 to 90 percent
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 28 degrees F., -5 to -2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 15 inches, 250 to 380 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Steese and Gilmore series. Steese and Gilmore soils are well drained and occur on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat excessively drained, very high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the loamy surface mantle and very high in the loess mixed with residuum and weathered schist bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wild life habitat and recreation.  The native vegetation includes grasses, red cedar, roses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 231, Interior Alaska Highlands, The series is of limited extent.
