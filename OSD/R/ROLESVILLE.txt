COMPETING SERIES:
These are the Assateague, Buncombe, Crevasse, Malden, Peveto, and Tarboro series in the same family and the Ashlar, Wake, and Wateree series in related families.

Assateague soils-are very deep, formed from sandy marine sediments, and on beach dunes of the Lower Coastal Plain.
Buncombe soils-are very deep, formed from sandy fluvial sediments, and on flood plains of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain.
Crevasse soils-are very deep and formed from sandy fluvial sediments on the Mississippi River.
Malden soils-are very deep and formed from sandy sediments of old natural levees on the Mississippi River
Peveto soils-are very deep, formed from coastal beach deposits of sand and shell along the gulf coast of Louisiana
Tarboro soils-are very deep, formed in sandy fluvial and marine sediments, and occur on stream terraces of the Coastal Plain
Similar Series:
Ashlar soils-are coarse loamy, have a depth to unweathered bedrock of 20 to 40 inches, and occur on the same landscape
Wake soils-are shallow, have a a depth to weathered bedrock of 11 to 20 inches, and occur on the same landscape
Wateree soils-are coarse loamy, have a depth to weathered bedrock of 20 to 40 inches, and occur on the same landscape
