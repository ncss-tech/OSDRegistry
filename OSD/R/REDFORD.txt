REDFORD SERIES

The Redford series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium and residuum derived from fanglomerate. Redford soils are on ballenas and fan remnants in intermontane basins. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Redford very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 85 percent of the surface is covered with igneous gravel and cobbles. 

    A--0 to 3 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 55 percent igneous gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bk--3 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; common very fine and fine roots; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; 30 percent igneous gravel; 6 percent medium faint carbonate masses; calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 percent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (9 to 11 inches thick)

    R--14 to 24 inches; strongly cemented fanglomerate bedrock, very high excavation difficulty; violently effervescent. 

TYPE LOCATION: Presidio County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S. Highway 67 and FM 170 in Presidio, TX; 33.1 miles southeast on FM 170; 1778 feet north-northwest of the road in rangeland. USGS Quadrangle: Santana Mesa, Texas. Latitude: 29 degrees, 19 minutes, 6.3 seconds North, Longitude: 103 degrees, 59 minutes, 23.3 seconds West; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Redlight (TX) series.  Redlight soils have 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, are on hills and mountains formed from limestone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redford soils are mostly on shoulders and backslopes of ballenas and fan remnants in intermontane basins. These soils formed in gravelly alluvium and residuum derived from fanglomerate. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,800 to 3,995 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 240 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Corazones (TX), Ojinaga (T-TX), and Pantera (TX) soils. Corazones soils are very deep and generally occur on lower positions. Ojinaga soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and occur on summits and shoulders of fan remnants and pediment remnants. Pantera soils are very deep and occur in drainageways. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high runoff; very slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Desert Shrubland vegetative zone. Native vegetation includes ocotillo, leatherstem, creosotebush, lechuguilla, chino grama, and fluffgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West Texas. MLRA 42. This series is of moderate extent.
