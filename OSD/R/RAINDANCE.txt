RAINDANCE SERIES


The Raindance series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Raindance soils are on stream terraces and outwash terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Raindance loam--pastureland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 50 cm thick)

 C3--102 to 152 cm; pale olive (5Y 6/3) sandy clay loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots throughout; few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent fine olive gray (5Y 5/2) redox depletions; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Raindance soils are on stream terraces and outwash terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eastwalker and Goodbye series. Eastwalker and Goodbye soils lack a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; rapid permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Enodsaturation is present with a apparent seasonal high water table between 75 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is common. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year round.

USE AND VEGETATION: Raindance soils are used for pastureland, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
