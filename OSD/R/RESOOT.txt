RESOOT SERIES

The Resoot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  The Resoot soils are on moraines, ridges and mountain sides.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Vertic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Resoot gravelly loam -- on a 23 percent concave, east aspect in rangeland at 6,600 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on September 5, 1984, the soil was dry to 12 inches and moist below this depth.)

	A1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

	A2--3 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 35 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles; most coarse fragments are in a stone line near lower boundary of horizon; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

	Btss--12 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; few slickensides; 40 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 inches thick)

	Btk1--22 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 45 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; few lime coats 1 to 3 mm thick on undersides and some sides of coarse fragments; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

Btk2--32 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots many very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds in areas without lime; 40 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; lime coats 1 to 5 mm thick on all sides of coarse fragments; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Devoy, Dryn, Embargo, Home Camp, Lemco, Passar, Redchief, Rooset, Spinlin, Tatiyee, Tellura, Threedot and Wilpar series.  Devoy, Dryn, Embargo, Home Camp and Sprinlin soils have lithic or paralithic contacts of less than 40 inches.  Lemco soils have 0 horizons and lack carbonates.  Passar soils lack carbonates.  Redchief soils have average summer soil temperatures of 50 degrees F., have strongly acid Bt horizons and lack carbonates.  Rooset soils lacks 10YR hues in the argillic horizon and receive equal amounts of precipitation during most months.  Tatiyee soils have ustic soils moisture regimes and lack carbonates.  Tellura soils are noneffervescent above 40 inches.  Threedot soils lack carbonates and have E horizons.  Wilpar soils have weak or moderate subangular blocky structure in the Bt horizon and average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F.
   
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Resoot soils are on moraines, ridges and mountains.  These soils formed in slope alluvium from extrusive igneous rocks. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 5,500 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches; average annual temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dacont, Friedman, Nielsen and Zeebar soils.  Dacont soils are on mountains and have loamy-skeletal control sections.  Friedman soils are on mountains and are pachic.  Nielsen soils are on mountains and are shallow to bedrock.  Zeebar soils are on mountains and have loamy-skeletal control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow and medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly threetip sagebrush and Idaho fescue or mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  This series is moderately extensive.
