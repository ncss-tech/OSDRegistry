REDSAGE SERIES

The Redsage series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Redsage soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Redsage loam, in irrigated pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

  A--0 to 8 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate thin to medium platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine, common fine, and few medium tubular pores; violently effervescent, finely disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

  Bw--8 to 36 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium and thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium tubular pores; violently effervescent, finely disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

  Bk1--36 to 81 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, and few fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine, and few medium tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 5 percent fine irregular shaped soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

  Bk2--81 to 152 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, and few fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine, and few medium tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 5 percent fine irregular shaped soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). (combined thickness of the Bk1, Bk2 horizons - 75 to 142 cm)
