RAKANE SERIES

The Rakane series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The Rakane soils are on old dissected terraces and terrace sideslopes.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rakane loam--on a southwest facing slope of 4 percent under rangeland vegetation at 3,560 feet elevation.  (Colors are for a dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on September 9, 1984, the soil profile was dry.

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5): clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    BA--3 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt1--9 to 25 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores;  common distinct clay films in pores and on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 18 inches thick)

    Bt2--25 to 38 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films in pores and on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick)

    Bkqm--38 to 73 inches; continuous silica and lime cemented indurated duripan; silica lenses 1/4 to 1 inch thick every 3 to 4 inches with extremely hard cemented material between lenses.

TYPE LOCATION:  Twin Falls County, Idaho, about 14 miles northwest of Buhl, Idaho; in the northeast 1/4, northeast 1/4, northwest 1/4 of section 19, T. 8 S., R. 13 E.

Depth to duripan - 20 to 40 inches
Depth to bedrock - greater than 60 inches
Control section - clay: 18 to 32 percent
Depth to sand and gravel - 30 to more than 60 inches

A horizon

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arbidge, Dacker (T), Debab (T), Deerlodge, Ditchcamp, Exel, Idow (T), Lembos (T), Madras, Ochoco, Snowmore (T), Wako (T), Wellsed, and Wendell (T) series.  Arbidge and Ochoco soils have duripans less than 10 inches thick.  Dacker soils have a silty clay loam argillic horizon.  Debab and Womack soils have a loamy skeletal layer between the argillic and the pan.  Deerlodge and Exel soils have hues redder than 10YR in the argillic horizon.  Ditchcamp, Snowmore, and Wendell soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Lembos soils are slightly to moderately calcareous in the argillic horizons.  Madras soils have 10 to 30 percent pumice fragments above the pan, and are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Idow soils have Bk horizons.  Wako soils have E horizons.  Wellsed soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the soil layer between the argillic and the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rakane soils are on old dissected terraces and terrace sideslopes.  These soils formed in old alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F., and the frost free season is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blacknest, Chuska, Dolman, Purdam, Sluka, Tulch, and Yahoo soils.  Blacknest soils do not have a duripan.  Chuska and Yahoo soils are shallow to a duripan.  Purdam soils have fine-silty control sections.  Dolman and Sluka soils have coarse-silty control sections, and do not have argillic horizons.  All of the above soils are on the same land form as Rakane soils.  Tulch soils have fine-silty control sections, do not have argillic horizons or duripans, and are on lower terraces and along larger drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, runoff is medium; permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rakane soils are used for rangeland and irrigated crops.  Native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.  Irrigated crops are mainly wheat, barley, sugar beets, potatoes, beans, and alfalfa hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Rakane soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.
