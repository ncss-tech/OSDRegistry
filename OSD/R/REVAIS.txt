REVAIS SERIES

The Revais series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, nonacid, frigid Typic Xerofluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Revais silt loam, forested  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium, few coarse roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 14 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    C2--14 to 38 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, consisting of stratified silt loam and very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; common, fine, faint, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium, few coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 35 inches thick)

    C3--38 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, consisting of stratified silt loam and very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; common, fine, faint, strong brown  (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and coarse roots; neutral (pH6.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - protected floodplains.

Elevation - 2,400 to 2,600 feet.

Slope - 0 to 2 percent.

Parent material - silty alluvium.

Climate - long, cold winters, moist springs, warm, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 13 to 18 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rain.

Mean annual temperature - 42 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 95 to 125 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability.  These soils are protected from flooding by Kerr dam.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for understory grazing, pasture and wildlife habitat.  They have potential as irrigated cropland.  The potential native vegetation is slender wheatgrass, black cottonwood, shrubs and other perennial grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Revais soils are of limited extent along the Flathead and Clark Fork River drainages in northwestern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanders County, Montana 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1063.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A and C1 horizons) and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (C1, C2, and C3 horizons).  Revais soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
