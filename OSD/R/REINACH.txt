REINACH SERIES

The Reinach series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium mostly from red beds of Permian age.  These nearly level soils are on high flood plains predominantly in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 910 mm (36 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Reinach silt loam-cultivated, at an elevation of 345 m (1132 ft) (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Ap horizon is 0 to 30 cm [0 to 12 in])

     A1--23 to 36 cm (9 to 14 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; many wormcasts; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  

     A2--36 to 76 cm (14 to 30 in); reddish brown (2.5YR 5/3) silt loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; many wormcasts; few dark colored krotovinas; slight effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 13 to 76 cm [5 to 30 in])

     Bwk--76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) silt loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; many wormcasts, few dark colored krotovinas; few soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate beginning at 35 inches; calcareous; strong effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 15 to 102 cm [6 to 40 in])

     Ck--127 to 203 cm (50 to 80 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) very fine sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots and pores; few wormcasts; few soft masses and films of calcium carbonate; few fine concretions of calcium carbonate; calcareous; strong effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in the same family.  Canadian, Crisfield, Dale, Keokuk, Minco, and Nash series are in similar families.  
Canadian, Crisfield, Keokuk, Minco, and Nash soils: have a mollic epipedon less than 51 cm (20 in) thick; in addition, Canadian and Crisfield soils contain more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand 
Dale soils: have more than 18 percent clay in the control section
Nash soils: have sandstone or siltstone at a depth of about 102 cm (40 in)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in loamy alluvium 
Landscape: alluvial plains
Landform: flood plains   
Slope: 0 to l percent  
Mean annual precipitation: 737 to 991 (29 to 39 in) 
Mean annual air temperature: 15 to 16.1 degrees C (59 to 61 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 229 to 442 m (751 to 1450 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amber, Canadian, Crisfield, Dale, Hawley, McLain, Port, and Yahola series.
Amber soils: are in slightly lower areas and do not have a mollic epipedon
Canadian, Crisfield, and Hawley soils: are on similar positions, and closer to the streams
Dale soils: are on similar positions, and further from the stream
Hawley soils: have a coarse-loamy control section  
McLain soils: are also on high flood plains, in lower positions farther from the stream, and have an argillic horizon that has more than 35 percent clay in the control section 
Port soils: are in lower flood plains and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section  
Yahola soils: are in lower flood plains, do not have a mollic epipedon, and have a coarse-loamy control section

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage: well drained 
Permeability: moderate
Runoff: negligible
Flooding: rare, for very brief periods, from April to November 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for growing alfalfa, cotton, small grains, and sorghums.  Native vegetation is tall and mid prairie grasses.  Some areas have elm, hackberry, oak, walnut, and pecan trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A) of central Oklahoma, and south-central Kansas.  The series is moderately extensive.
