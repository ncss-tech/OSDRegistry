ROLLERSVILLE SERIES

The Rollersville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in sandy glaciolacustrine sediments and the underlying till. These soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Essexville series. Essexville soils do not have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section. Other series in related families are the Granby, Gumz, Kentland, and Maumee series which have a sandy particle-size class. In addition, Granby, Gumz, Kentland, and Maumee soils have less than 27 percent clay and do not have dense till in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rollersville soils are on lake plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope gradient is 0 to 1 percent. The soils formed in sandy glaciolacustrine sediments and the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the very poorly drained Hoytville, Risingsun, and Toussaint (T) soils, the somewhat poorly drained Tedrow soils, and the moderately well drained Ottokee soils. The Hoytville soils have an ochric epipedon, an argillic horizon, and between 40 and 55 percent clay in the particle-size control section. They are on adjacent planar surfaces. The Risingsun soils have a histic epipedon and are in slight depressions. The Toussaint soils have an ochric epipedon and between 35 and 55 percent clay in the cambic horizon. The Tedrow soils have an ochric epipedon and are on slight rises. The Ottokee soils have an ochric epipedon and are on convex knolls and ridges.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) between November and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy material moderately low in the lower part of the solum formed in till, and low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the sandy material, moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the solum formed in till, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and specialty crops such as tomatoes and cabbage are the principal crops. A relatively small proportion is in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest, primarily ash, beech, elm, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio; MLRA 99. The series is of small extent, about 340 acres.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wood County, Ohio, 2000.

REMARKS: Rollersville soils have been converted from Muck map units during the modernization project in Wood County, Ohio. These soils originally had a histic epipedon that was later depleted due to oxidation, wind erosion, and subsequent incorporation with mineral material.

Particle-size class has been changed with the revision (10/2003) from coarse-loamy to sandy over loamy based on lab data for pedon WD-134. The cation-exchange activity class was also changed from superactive to active to reflect the loamy portion of the control section. Also, Great Group was changed from Epiaquolls to Endoaquolls based on landform position.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 155111 in MO 11.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 132 cm (Bg, 2BC horizon).
Densic contact: at 132 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features present in all horizons.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data for the typical pedon (WD-134) is available at The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory.
