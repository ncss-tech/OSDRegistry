RUINS SERIES

The Ruins series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from quartz, sandstone and arkose.  Ruins soils are on high fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Vertic Paleargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Ruins fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 5 to 20 percent of the surface is covered with gravel and/or cobble

    A--0 to 5 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--5 to 9 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces and on rock fragments; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--9 to 20 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many medium and few fine and very fine roots matted between ped faces; few fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on ped faces; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Bt3--20 to 28 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) clay, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; strong very coarse and coarse wedges; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many medium roots with few fine and very roots matted between ped faces; few fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on ped faces; many distinct pressure faces; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Bt4--28 to 60 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3) very cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on ped faces and rock fragments; 30 percent cobble and 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2). (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 40 to 60 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ruins soils are on high fan terraces at elevations of 4,400 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in fan alluvium from quartz, sandstone and arkose.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Naco, Nolam, Libby, Buntline and Keysto soils.  Nolam and Keysto soils are loamy-skeletal.  Buntline soils have a hardpan.  Naco soils are clayey-skeletal.  Libby soils contain petronodes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes mesquite, vine mesquite, sideoats grama, shrubby buckwheat, range ratany, curly mesquite, and false mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  Ruins soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA is 41.
