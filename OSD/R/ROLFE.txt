ROLFE SERIES

The Rolfe series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in 60 to 150 centimeters of local alluvium and in the underlying glacial drift.  These soils occur in shallow potholes on relatively undissected, gently undulating till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.

There is some question as to whether Rolfe soils in some areas do not have an abrupt clay increase in the argillic horizon, but at the present time it is believed best to classify them as Typic Argialbolls. 

The type location was moved to this site from a site in Clay County to better portray the series concept and its geographic location.
