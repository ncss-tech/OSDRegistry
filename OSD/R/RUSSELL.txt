RUSSELL SERIES

The Russell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep or very deep to dense till. The Russell soils formed in loess and in the underlying loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Russell soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients are commonly between 0 and 6 percent but range to 25 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 13 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 155 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cyclone, Fincastle, Hennepin, Miami, Treaty and Xenia soils. The moderately well drained Xenia soils, the somewhat poorly drained Fincastle soils, and the poorly drained Treaty soils form a drainage sequence with the Russell soils. The poorly drained Cyclone and Treaty soils have a mollic epipedon and are in depressions. The Fincastle soils are on less sloping or lower landform positions. The Xenia soils are on less sloping or slightly lower landform positions. The well drained Hennepin soils are on steeper backslopes. The moderately well drained Miami soils have a thinner mantle of loess and are on more sloping positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table typically ranges from 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6.0 feet) from December to April in normal years. In some areas, the depth to the seasonal high water table is greater than 183 cm (6.0 feet). The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and low to moderately high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderate or moderately slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods of oak, hickory, and sugar maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111A and 111D in central and south central Indiana and southwestern Ohio; MLRA 108A in Illinois; and MLRA 108C in southeastern Iowa. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of large extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).

Densic contact: at 147 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox concentrations present in the 2BCt horizon at a depth of 132 and 147 cm.

Representative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153378 in MO 11.

Moderately slowly permeable and bedrock substratum phases are recognized. These soils will be evaluated during MLRA update activities to determine whether a new series is needed.
