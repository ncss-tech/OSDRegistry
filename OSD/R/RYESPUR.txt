SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES PROPOSED:
Klamath County, Oregon, 2007
Origin of the name--Rye Spur trail on the Fremont-Winema National forest, south of Fourmile Lake 

REMARKS: This pedon was the typical pedon for the Woodcock series.  This area is not considered to be representative of the Woodcock Series.  Woodcock is medial-skelatal and has andic soil properties, and this pedon is loamy-skeletal and does not have andic soil properties. The Woodcock typical pedon is moved to a cryic area. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
*Organic soil material--zone 0 to 1 cm (Oi horizon)
*Mollic epipedon--zone from 1 to 44 cm (A1, A2, and BA horizons)
*Vitrandic intergrade feature--zone from 1 to 44 cm (A1, A2, and BA horizons)
*Argillic horizon--zone from 44 to 123 cm (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)
*Lithologic discontinuity--44 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 44 to 94 cm (2Bt1 horizon and part of the 2Bt2 horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
*Characterization data on 4 pedons (S66 Oreg.18-5, 18-6, 18-7, and 18-8) reported in Riverside Soil Survey Laboratory report as Woodcock soils samples in Klamath County, Oregon, 1966. These 4 pedons correspond to Nasis User Pedon IDs S1966OR035005, S1966OR035006, S1966OR035007, S1966OR035011, respectively, and to KSSL pedon IDs 40A0840, 40A0841, 40A0842, 40A0843, respectively. S66 Oreg.18-5 is this Ryespur OSD pedon; the other 3 pedons are assumed to correlate to the Ryespur series as well, rather than Woodcock.
