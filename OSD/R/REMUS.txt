REMUS SERIES

The Remus series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Remus sandy loam , on a southwest-facing, convex, 5 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 cm (6 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many very fine roots; about 4 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 E--15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common very fine roots; about 5 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 36 cm (14 inches) thick]

 E/B--23 to 46 cm (9 to 18 inches); 70 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam (E); moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; common very fine pores; very hard when dry, friable when moist; extending into or completely surrounding isolated remnants of brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam (Bt); moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on vertical faces of peds; few fine roots; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 41 cm (16 inches) thick]

 B/E--46 to 58 cm (18 to 23 inches); 85 percent brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam (Bt); weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on surfaces of some peds; surrounded or penetrated by tongues of pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam (E); few fine roots; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 48 cm (19 inches) thick]

 Bt--58 to 81 cm (23 to 32 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few very fine roots; many distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 2 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [15 to 79 cm (6 to 31 inches) thick]

 BC--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; about 2 percent gravel; neutral. [0 to 81 cm (32 inches) thick]

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Filer series. Filer soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Remus soils are on ground moraines and end moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slopes typically are 0 to 18 percent, but range from 0 to 60 percent. The Remus soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 9.4 degrees C (45 to 49 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Locke, Marlette, Owosso, and Spinks soils. Locke soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in a drainage sequence with Remus soils. Spinks soils are coarser textured. The moderately well drained Marlette soils are finer textured. Owosso soils have a finer textured substratum than Remus soils. Marlette, Owosso, and Spinks soils are on similar topographic positions as Remus soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is low to very high depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large portion of the gentle slopes are cultivated. Corn, alfalfa, and small grain are the principal crops. Other areas are in woodland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96 and 98 in the central portion of lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
