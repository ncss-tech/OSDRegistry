REALMCOY SERIES

The Realmcoy series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. The Realmcoy soils are on mountain backslopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Realmcoy gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones. Lithology of the fragments is quartzite.

(4 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial and tubular pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--36 to 48 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine, fine, and medium interstitial and tubular pores; common faint and few distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 15 to 32 cm thick)

    R--48 cm; indurated quartzite.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bellenmine, Celeridge, Gabica,  Genoa, Gerdog, Gidwin, Grandeposit, Hawkridge, Hutchley, Loope, Majorsplace, Mattier, Melling, Pernog, Raw (no description available), Rozara, Shalcleav, and Tweener series. 

Bellenmine and Majorsplace soils are intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. Celeridge soils are derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite have a mollic thickness of 36 to 50 cm, and have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Gabica soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Genoa soils formed in residuum weathered from granitic and some metamorphic rocks. Gerdog soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 17 to 19 degrees C. Gidwin soils have a mollic epipedon thickness of 36 to 50 cm.  Grandeposit soils formed in colluvium over residuum from quartzite and slate. . Hawkridge soils are dominated by gravel and average 14 to 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Hutchley soils have a mollic epipedon that is 25 to 50 cm thick. Loope soils have 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Mattier soils are 25 to 36 cm deep to a lithic contact and contains 10 to 20 percent volcanic glass. Melling soils formed in colluvium and residuum from intermediate and basic igneous rock. Pernog soils have a mollic epipedon that is 30 to 50 cm thick. Rozara soils have 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Shalcleav soils average 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section which are mainly channers and flagstones. Tweener soils have an argillic horizon that is 8 to 15 cm thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Realmcoy soils are on backslopes with north aspects of mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. 
Elevations are 2,010 to 3,050 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C.The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Grandeposit, Grube, and Rangertaft series. Grube soils are very deep to bedrock. Rangertaft soils are moderately deep and have mollic epipedons that are 40 to 56 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Realmcoy soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly, bluebunch wheatgrass, mutton grass, and low sagebrush. This site is correlated to Ecological Site R28BY036NV, Claypan 14+ P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
