RAFTRIVER SERIES

The Raftriver series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from schist, quartzite, and volcanic ash on dissected fan terraces. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 355 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Xereptic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Raftriver loam--rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine vesicular pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--8 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

    Bqk--30 to 61 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate thick platy structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm; few very fine and fine tubular pores; weakly cemented; moderately calcareous (11 percent calcium carbonate), carbonates are disseminated and in soft powdery masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt smooth boundary. (25 to 61 cm thick)

    Bqkm--61 to 81 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) weakly cemented duripan, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm; thin laminar cap; strongly calcareous (18 percent calcium carbonate), carbonates are disseminated and in visible masses; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (12 to 41 cm thick)

    B'qk--81 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm and brittle; 5 percent durinodes; moderately calcareous (8 percent calcium carbonate), carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Dahar series. Dahar soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Raftriver soils are on dissected fan terraces at elevations of 1,640 to 1,890 meters. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from schist, quartzite, and volcanic ash. The average annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm. The mean annual temperature is 5.5 to 7.0 degrees C., and the freeze-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Acord, Rodrof, and Solak soils. The Acord soils are higher on fan terraces and hillsides, are loamy-skeletal, and have an argillic horizon. The Rodrof soils are on hillsides and are loamy-skeletal. The Solak soils are on hillsides and are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity class; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mainly used for rangeland. The potential vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, and Nevada bluegrass. Many areas have been seeded to crested wheatgrass. A few areas are used for irrigated cropland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Raftriver soils are in northwest Utah and southern Idaho, and are of moderate extent, with 17,454 acres mapped to date. MLRA 25.

REMARKS: 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to approximately 30 cm (A and Bw horizons).
Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 30 cm (Bw horizon).
Calcic horizon - the zone from 30 to 61 cm (Bqk horizon).
Duripan - the zone from 61 to 81 cm (Bqkm horizon).
Xereptic feature - the duripan is not indurated in any subhorizon and the moisture regime is aridic but borders on xeric.
Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 61 cm (Part of the Bw and Bqk horizons).
