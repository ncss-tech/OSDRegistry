RENEGADE SERIES

The Renegade series consists of deep to sandstone or shale, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Renegade soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 50 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Renegade very flaggy fine sandy loam, on a northwest facing, linear to concave, 75 percent slope in browse at an elevation of 7,290 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    The surface is covered by about 5 percent angular stones, 15 percent flagstones, and 10 percent channers.  The fragments are hard fine grain sandstone.  There is 1 inch of undecomposed leaves, needles, and twigs.

    A1--0 to 4 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very flaggy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; 20 percent flagstones; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--4 to 15 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) flaggy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; 15 percent flagstones, 5 percent angular gravel, 5 percent angular cobbles; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of A horizons range from 10 to 15 inches thick)

    C1--15 to 35 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very flaggy fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine, fine, and medium tubular pores; 30 percent flagstones, 10 percent angular cobbles, 5 percent angular gravel; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--35 to 47 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very flaggy fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent flagstones, 15 percent angular cobbles, 10 percent angular gravel; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary.

    C3--47 to 58 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely flaggy sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 20 percent flagstones, 15 percent angular cobbles, 10 percent angular gravel; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of C horizons range from 35 to 45 inches thick)

    Cr--58 to 62 inches; weathered soft sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 1.5 miles southeast of Ruple Point on Blue Mountain; located about 2,400 feet east and 2,500 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 19, T.4S., R.25E., SLBM; Split Mountain, Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 27 minutes 31 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 8 minutes 43 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Typic Ustic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Depth to paralithic contact:  40 to 60 inches to weathered shale or sandstone
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  10 to 16 inches

Surface rock fragments:  25 to 50 percent (predominantly flagstones and channers with smaller amounts of stones and boulders derived from sandstone and shale lithology).

Particle-size control section:  7 to 18 percent clay; 35 to 70 percent rocks (predominantly flagstones and channers derived from sandstone and shale lithology).

A horizon:
Hue:  5YR to 10YR
Value:  3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 10 percent
Reaction:  slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue:  5YR to 10YR
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  4 to 6
Texture:  fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam with very flaggy or extremely flaggy modifiers
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 10 percent
Reaction:  slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Perma and Wimper series.

Perma and Wimper soils do not have a paralithic or lithic contact within 60 inches of the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.
Landform:  hillslopes.
Slopes:  50 to 80 percent
Elevation: 6,200 to 7,800 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches.
Frost-free period:  70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cortyzack, Duffymont, Sheecal, and Splimo series.  

Cortyzack soils occur on hill summits and shoulders and are very deep.
Duffymont soils occur on hill summits and shoulders and are shallow to bedrock.
Sheecal soils occur on hillslopes and do not have a mollic epipedon.
Splimo soils occur on hillslopes and are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  These soils have been correlated to Mountain Very Steep Stony Loam (Browse) - 047CY474UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is taken from a nearby geographic location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (A2, C1, and C2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered sandstone at 58 inches.  (Cr horizon)

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."
