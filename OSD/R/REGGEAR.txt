REGGEAR SERIES

The Reggear series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well-drained soils on mountain slopes or hills on basalt plateaus. They formed in a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash over loess and reworked loess. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or low in the fragipan. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 35 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Reggear soils are on mountain slopes or hills on basalt plateaus. They have elevations of 1,600 to 3,800 feet (488 to 1158 meters) and slopes of 2 to 40 percent. These soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a mixed volcanic ash mantle. The average annual air temperature varies from about 38 degrees to about 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 45 inches (660 to 1143 mm), and the frost free period is 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carlinton, Cavendish, Grangemont, Kauder, and Wilkins series. Carlinton and Cavendish soils are on south and west facing hills and have xeric moisture regimes. Kauder and Grangemont soils are on similar landscapes and have ash mantles 7 to 13 inches thick. Grangemont soils do not have a fragipan. Wilkins soils are in drainageways and are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or low in the fragipan. A perched water table is present. Typically it occurs at a depth of 22 to 28 inches from December through May, but can occur at a depth of 18 to 34 inches November through July.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for timber production, livestock grazing, tree nurseries, wildlife habitat, and watershed. The natural vegetation is grand fir, Douglas-fir, oceanspray, snowberry, ninebark, huckleberry, queencup beadlily, myrtle pachystima, and goldthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho and north eastern Washington. MLRAs 9, 43A and 44A. Reggear soils are of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: St. Joe Area, Shoshone County, Idaho, 1993.

REMARKS: Type location moved to present location in 1983.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Oi and A horizons)

Vitrandic feature - the zone from 2 to 13 inches (A and Bw horizons)

Oxyaquic feature - the zone from 22 to 31 inches (2Bt/E horizon) having saturation with water for 30 or more cumulative days. 

Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 13 inches (Bw horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 86 inches (2Bt/E, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, and 2Btx3 horizons)

Fragipan - the zone from 31 to 86 inches (2Btx1, 2Btx2, and 2Btx3 horizons)

Particle size control section - the zone from 22 to 31 inches (2Bt/E horizon)

Reggear meets the criteria for the Oxyaquic subgroup - having saturation with water in one or more layers above the fragipan for 30 or more cumulative days.  

The 2/2009 revision reflects a change in great group from Fragiudalfs to Fraglossudalfs.  The colors in the 2Bt/E horizon in the typical pedon meet the criteria for a glossic horizon.  

This series needs further MLRA investigation because the colors listed in the range in characteristics cross taxonomic requirements for both Fraglossudalfs and Fragiudalfs.  The drainage class of Reggear should also be investigated because as described this series appears to meet the MO-1 guide for somewhat poorly drained.
