REEBOK SERIES

The Reebok series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from latite, andesite, rhyolite, quartzite, and limestone.  Reebok soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants and hillsides and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Petrocalcic Palexerolls

(0 to 10 cm thick)

    Bkkm--48 to 58 cm; indurated carbonate hardpan that has a laminar cap surface and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) laminae 2 to 4 mm thick.  Subjacent layers are very pale brown (10YR 8/2) moist and are softer; violently effervescent, (92 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants and hillsides at elevations of 1,524 to 2,320 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from latite, welded breccia, andesite, rhyolite, quartzite, and limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.0 to 11.7 degrees C.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.  Average annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borvant, Dagor, Donnardo, Mountainville, Renol and Sumine soils and the similar Pavant soils.  Borvant soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Dagor, Donnardo, Mountainville and Sumine soils do not have petrocalcic horizons.  Renol soils have a petrocalcic horizon at a depth of 50 to 100 cm and an aridic soil moisture regime. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Potential vegetation is big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, peavine, and Indian ricegrass.  These soils are correlated to upland ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Inextensive; located in central Utah.

REMARKS:Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: - The zone from 0 to 28 cm (A1, A2 and Bt horizons).
Argillic horizon -  The zone from 13 to 28 cm (Bt horizon).
Petrocalcic horizon:  The zone from 48 to 58 cm (Bkkm horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 28 cm (Bt horizon).

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
