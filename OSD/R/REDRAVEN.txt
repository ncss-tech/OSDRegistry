REDRAVEN SERIES

The Redraven series consists of very deep, well drained soils in glacial troughs, moraines, and on glaciated mountainsides and ridgetops. They formed in glacial till derived from gneiss, schist, or quartzite rocks with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baldeagle and Katka series.  Baldeagle soils do not have a 2Bw horizon. Katka soils have dark colored AB horions and are dry for 30 to 45 days in the moisture control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redraven soils are in glacial troughs, moraines, and cirque basins, and on glaciated mountain slopes and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 0 to 80 percent.  These soils formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, schist, or quartzite rocks with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 6,350 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches, and frost-free season is from 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bouldercreek, Vaywood and the competing Vay soils.  Bouldercreek soils are on mountainsides at lower elevations and are frigid.  Vay and Vaywood soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability in the solum and moderately rapid to rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, and Engelmann spruce, with an understory of big blueberry, common beargrass, myrtle pachystima, rustyleaf menziesia, elk sedge, queencup beadlily, Utah honeysuckle, and Sitka mountainash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  This soil is not extensive.
