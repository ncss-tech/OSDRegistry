REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm
*Umbric epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 35 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 35 to 150 cm
*Aquic conditions--zone from the surface to a depth of 150 cm
*Endosaturation--zone from the surface to a depth of 150 cm

11/2016-- Based on update field investigations, the type location was moved, the soil classification was changed from fine, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Vertic Endoaquepts, and the series concept was limited to MLRA 2 soils with endosaturation. The official series description was edited according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation to recorrelate Rennie soils mapped in the flood plains of MLRAs 1 and 4a is recommended.
