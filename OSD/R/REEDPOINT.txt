REEDPOINT SERIES

The Reedpoint series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, escarpments, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Reedpoint very channery loam, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine pores; 38 percent sandstone channers; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    R--5 inches or more; hard, noncalcareous sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sweet Grass County, Montana; 2,300 feet west and 2,800 feet south of the NE corner of sec. 36, T. 3 N., R. 18 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Heating degree days - (normals 1941-70) 7331 days.

Cooling degree days - (normals 1941-70) 379 days.

Moisture control section - from 4 inches to bedrock; moist April through June, dry some or all parts July through mid September, and moist some or all parts mid September through October.  The soil has an Aridic-Ustic moisture regime.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 4 to 9 inches.

Rock fragments - 35 to 60 percent sandstone pebbles and channers.

Depth to bedrock - 4 to 10 inches.

Thin B horizons, less than 3 inches thick, having higher moist values, prismatic or blocky structure and slight clay increases are allowed.


A horizon - Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR

Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Chroma:  2 or 3

Texture:  loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam

Clay content:  10 to 35 percent

Fine and coarser sand content:  less than 35 percent

Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent--35 to 45 percent channers, 0 to 15 percent flagstones

Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.8

COMPETING SERIES:

Duffymont (CO) - dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 days after July first; 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact.

Moonset (UT) - are shallow to shale bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - bedrock-floored plains; escarpments; hills; mountains.

Elevation - 3,700 to 5,500 feet.

Slope - 0 to 75 percent.

Parent material - residuum or colluvium derived from sandstone.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, more than 70 percent of which falls in spring or early summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 90 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ethridge, Evanston, Rentsac and Sixbeacon soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Reedpoint soils are used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, eriogonum, phlox, and other perennial grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This series is of limited extent; found mainly in the sedimentary uplands of south-central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sweet Grass County, Montana, 2000.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1374.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 5 inches (A horizon); particle-size control section - from the soil surface to a depth of 5 inches (A horizon); lithic contact - at a depth of 5 inches (R horizon).  Reedpoint soils have an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
