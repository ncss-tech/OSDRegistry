RUBYCREEK SERIES

The Rubycreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, footslopes, and ridgetops.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist rocks with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid below.  Slope ranges from 2 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buhrig, Goodlow, Growden, Hun, Mohaggin, Prouty, Rustlerpeak, and Threebutte (T), series.  Buhrig and Threebutte soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Goodlow and Growden soils have an umbric epipedon.  Hun soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Mohaggin soils have ashy textural modifiers in the A horizon. Moses, Prouty and Rustlerpeak soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rubycreek soils are on mountains, footslopes, and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist rocks with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is cold, with cool moist summers and cold wet winters.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches.  The average frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pend Oreille, Redraven, and Roman(T) series.  Pend Oreille soils are on north-facing mountain slopes at lower elevations and have a volcanic ash mantle greater than 14 inches thick.  Redraven soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and have a volcanic ash mantle greater than 14 inches thick.  Roman(T) soils are on similar landscape positions and are sandy-skeletal in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for woodland timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, white bark pine, western larch, and lodgepole pine with an understory of rustyleaf menziesia, common beargrass, big blueberry, Utah honeysuckle, myrtle pachystima, common yarrow, and pearly everlasting.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana, and northeastern Washington.  This series is not extensive
