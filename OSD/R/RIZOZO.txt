RIZOZO SERIES 

The Rizozo series consists of soils that are very shallow or shallow to hard sandstone.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium, residuum and eolian sediments derived from siltstone or sandstone. These soils are on dipslopes of cuestas, scarps and mesas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Rizozo loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 5 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bw--5 to 10 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) channery silt loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 30 percent channers; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 12 inches) 

    R--10 inches; hard red sandstone bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Union County, New Mexico; approximately 100 feet east of the southwest corner of section 30, T. 31 N., R. 34 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture - Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic. Typically, moist in some part of the soil moisture control section, intermittently from May 1 to October 30 and is dry in all parts periodically from November 1 to April 30. 

Soil Temperature: 50 to 58 degrees F. 
Depth to Bedrock: 4 to 20 inches. 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. 

Particle-size Control Section 
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent stones, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 5 to 30 percent pebbles and channers. Weighted average is less than 35 percent by volume. 
Fine-Earth Fraction: Very fine sandy loam to silt loam. 
Sand content: 5 to 25 percent coarser than very fine sand. 
Silt plus very fine sand content: 60 to 90 percent. 
Clay content: 5 to 25 percent. 

A and C Horizons
Hue: 10R to 5YR 
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 4 to 6 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hideout (UT), Kenzo (T UT), Lazear (CO), Rizno (UT), Simel (T UT), Skyvillage (NM), Tesihim (T AZ), and Travessilla (NM) series.   Potential competitors were a superactive activity class assigned are the Redspear (WY), Travson (WY), and Zukan (UT) series.
Bigmon soils: 
Hideout soils: has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.
Kenzo soils: have a mean annual precipitation of 9 to 12 inches.
Lazear soils: have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y.
Rizno soils: have more than 25 percent fine sand or coarser. 
Simel soils: average 27 to 35 percent clay in the PSCS.
Skyvillage soils: are dry in May and June and have hue of  7.5YR to 2.5Y 
Tesihim soils: have hue of 10YR and formed from volcanic tuff.
Travessilla soils: have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y. 
Redspear soils: are not channery in the particle size control section and are moist during the period March through June.
Travson soils: have hue of 10YR.
Zukan soils: have significant accumulations of calcium carbonate in the series control section and have a lithic contact with limestone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous alluvium, residuum and eolian sediments derived from siltstone and sandstone. Outcrops of sandstone are common on steep slopes. 
Landform: cuestas, scarps, and mesas.
Elevation:  4,500 to 7,500 feet. 
Slope: 0 to 55 percent.
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 18 inches, but ranges to a low of 10 inches. 
Mean annual temperature: 47 to 57 degrees F. 
Frost-free period: 125 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alicia, Kim, Manzano and the competing Travessilla soils. Alicia, Kim and Manzano soils do not have  bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained, runoff is high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high on slopes greater than 1 percent; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is blue grama, sideoats grama, threeawn species, galleta, snakeweed, juniper and pinyon. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern New Mexico, southern Colorado, northeastern Texas and the Oklahoma panhandle. LRR G, MLRA 70. The series is extensive.
