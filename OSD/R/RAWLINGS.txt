SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Morgan County, Georgia; 1998

REMARKS:  The Rawlings series was formerly included with the Rion series.  However, Rion soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 60 inches of the soil surface.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone between depths of 10 and 33 inches (Bt horizon)
Lithic contact - the occurrence of hard bedrock at a depth of 33 inches (R horizon)
