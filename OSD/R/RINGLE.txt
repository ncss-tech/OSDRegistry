RINGLE SERIES

The Ringle series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Ringle soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderate in the surface and rapid in the substratum.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ringle gravelly loam - on a 4 percent northeast-facing slope at an elevation of 5,720 feet in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)  When described on October 22, 1979, the soil was dry throughout.

    Akq--0 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles; calcium carbonate and silica layers up to 3 mm thick on undersides of coarse fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bkq1--4 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent pebbles; calcium carbonate and silica layers up to 3 mm thick on undersides of coarse fragments; strongly effervescent (calcium carbonate equivalent 60 percent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bkq2--9 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 55 percent pebbles; calcium carbonate and silica coatings 3 mm thick on undersides of coarse fragments; strongly effervescent (calcium carbonate equivalent 70 percent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bkq3--16 to 41 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2); single grain; loose; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 75 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; weak discontinuous cementation of sand and gravel by calcium carbonate and silica; violently effervescent (calcium carbonate equivalent 70 percent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    2Bkq4--41 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grain; loose; many very fine interstitial pores; 65 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; weak discontinuous cementation of sand and gravel by calcium carbonate and silica; strongly effervescent (calcium carbonate equivalent 74 percent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ringle soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 4,500 to 6,500 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone. The climate is cold and moist in winter and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches.  Average summer air temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F, and average annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kadletz, Leatherman, Pahsimeroi, Simeroi, Snowslide, and Whitecloud soils on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Snowslide and Simeroi soils have loamy-skeletal control sections.  Leatherman soils are shallow to a duripan.  Pahsimeroi and Whitecloud soils have an aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric and have more organic carbon in the surface layer than Ringle soils.  Kadletz soils are not calcareous in the top 18 centimeters after mixing.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; permeability is moderate in the surface and rapid in the lower part of the profile.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly shadscale, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread grass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and bud sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
