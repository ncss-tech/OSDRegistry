   A2--10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches); very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) fine sand, gray (7.5YR 5/1); weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft; nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots throughout; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. [5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches) thick] 

   2R--30 centimeters (12 inches); strongly to indurated limestone bedrock containing solution holes filled with sandy and loamy materials.

TYPE LOCATION:  Collier County, Florida; about 0.8 miles north of I75 and 0.7 miles east of the L28 canal; about 1,140 feet west and 985 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 36, T. 49 S., R. 34 E.; Latitude 26 degrees, 11 minutes, 4.00 seconds, N. Longitude 80 degrees, 52 minutes, 57.8 seconds, W; WGS84; USGS Doctors Hammock, Florida quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches)
Depth to seasonal high water table: 15 to 46 centimeters (6 to 18 inches)
Depth to limestone bedrock: 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches)
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout 
Rock Fragments: 0 to 14 percent throughout

Particle-size control section (weighted averages):  
Clay content: 0 to 10 percent
Fine sand content: 30 to 75 percent

A horizon:
Color--hue: 10YR or 2.5Y, value 2 or 3, and chroma 1 or 2.
Texture: Fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand; or their mucky analogues
Redoximorphic features: Depletions and/or concentrations, 1 to 20 percent, and fine or medium in size
Clay content: 0 to 10 percent
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 2

Bw horizon, where present:
Color--hue: 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.
Texture: Fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand
Redoximorphic features: Depletions and/or concentrations, 1 to 20 percent, and fine or medium in size
Clay content: 0 to 10 percent
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 2
Where the Bw occurs, it does not meet the requirements for a diagnostic cambic horizon.

C or Cg horizon, where present:
Color--hue: 10YR or 2.5Y, value 5 to 8, and chroma 1 to 3.
Texture: Fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand
Redoximorphic features: Depletions and/or concentrations, 1 to 20 percent, and fine or medium in size
Clay content: 0 to 6 percent
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 2
Some pedons have a thin gravelly layer above the limestone that has texture of sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

2R horizon:
Strongly cemented to indurated limestone bedrock.  Solution holes range from about 10 to 91 centimeters (4 inches to 3 feet) in diameter, sandy and loamy materials fill the solution holes.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: Sandy marine deposits over limestone bedrock.
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain and Florida Everglades
Landform: low hammocks, knolls, or rises on flatwoods, and rises or knolls on tree islands in the everglades
Mean annual temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C (77 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1651 millimeters (45 to 65 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Hallandale soils lack mollic epipedons and are on similar landform positions.
Cypress Lake soils lack mollic epipedons, have argillic horizons, have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are on slightly higher landform positions.
Copeland soils have argillic horizons, have limestone bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are on slightly lower landform positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Poorly drained.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): High to very high throughout
Runoff: High to very high
Depth to seasonal high water table: 15 to 46 centimeters (6 to 18 inches) of the surface for about 5 to 9 months during most years.
Flooding frequency and duration: Occasionally flooded for brief periods during periods of heavy rainfall, severe storms, and hurricanes. Currently flooding is affected by anthropogenic activities.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreation.
Dominant vegetation: sabal palm, saw palmetto, laurel oak, water oak, scattered south Florida slash pine, red mulberry, strangler fig, and redbay with an understory of citrus, marlberry, waxmyrtle, wild coffee, greenbriars, ferns, longleaf uniola, Eastern gamagrass, chalky bluestem, maidencane, and switchgrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Florida Everglades and associated areas (MLRA 156A).  This soil is of limited extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama
