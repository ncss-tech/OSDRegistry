ROACHGULCH SERIES

The Roachgulch series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Roachgulch sandy clay loam, 1 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 1,457 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Ap--0 to 20 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 35 cm thick)

   Bt1--20 to 42 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout, common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. 

   Bt2--42 to 60 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout, many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent fine 10YR 3/1 manganese masses, 5 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses, 2 percent fine 10YR 6/2 iron depletions; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons is 18 to 50 cm)

   C--60 to 88 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; 10 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses, 5 percent fine 10YR 6/2 iron depletions; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 70 cm thick)

   Btb--88 to 110 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent faint clay bridging between sand grains; 5 percent fine 10YR 3/1 manganese masses, 3 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses, 10 percent fine 2.5Y 6/1 iron depletions; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 40 cm thick)

   C'--110 to 200 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 2 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses, 5 percent fine 2.5Y 6/1 iron depletions; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).
