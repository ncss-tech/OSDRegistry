RAYNAL SERIES

The Raynal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on stream terraces and flood plains. They formed in mixed alluvium. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Cumulic Haploxerolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chiloquinot soils (T).  Chiloquinot soils do not have secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Raynal soils are on stream terraces and flood plains. They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. They formed in mixed alluvium. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 70 to 90 days. Elevations are 5,950 to 6,300 feet. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the  Bear Lake,  Bern (T)  Lago (T) and  Thomasfork (T) series. Bear Lake soils are poorly drained and have calcic horizons. Bear Lake and Lago soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Bern soils are moderately well drained and have calcic horizons. Thomasfork soils have a fine, montmorillonitic particle-size control section and cracks greater than 1/2 inch wide in the upper twenty inches of the profile. Bear Lake soils are on floodplains and in meander channels on positions below Raynal soils. Bern soils are on stream terraces above Raynal soils. Lago soils are in slightly lower positions than the Raynal soil. Thomasfork soils are on similar positions to Raynal soils but are located more towards the middle of the valley when associated with Raynal. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow or very slow runoff; moderately slow permeability; occasional or rare flooding for brief periods December through May.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for hayland and small grains. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This soil is of small extent in southeastern Idaho. MLRA 13.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 35 inches (the Ap, BA, Bkg1 and Bkg1 horizons). 

Cumulic feature - the soil has an irregular decrease in organic matter with increasing depth. 

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 inches to 40 inches (the BA, the Bkg1, Bkg2, and Bkg3 horizons).
