REILLOC SERIES

The Reilloc series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium and  residuum derived from basalt over bedrock. Reilloc soils are on plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Reilloc stony silt loam- rangeland, on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 3,020 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

 A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) stony silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

 A2--3 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 6 to 10 inches)

 Bt1--6 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; many, faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--10 to 13 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly silty clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; many, faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 4 to 10 inches)

 R--13 inches; basalt.

TYPE LOCATION: Klickitat County, Washington, about three miles northeast of Bickleton, 1,500 feet south and 1,650 feet east of the northwest corner of section 1, T. 6 N., R. 20 E. (Latitude 46 degrees, 02 minutes, 15 seconds N.; Longitude 120 degrees, 15 minutes, 14 seconds W.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 13 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon. Depth to bedrock is 12 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments dominated by rounded gravel of quartzitic origin in addition to subangular fragments of basaltic origin.  It has a  weighted average of 27 to 35 percent clay.
The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. Texture is stony silt loam in the upper part and gravelly loam or very gravelly loam in the lower part.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.
The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist. The Bt1 horizon is very gravelly silty clay loam, extremely gravelly silty clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. The Bt2 horizon is extremely gravelly silty clay loam, very gravelly clay, or very gravelly silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lacy, Ragpie, Riggins, Shinn, and Wahoo soils.
Lacy soils  are dry for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice; have an Oi horizon
Ragpie soils  particle-size control section with 35 to 45 percent angular and subangular rock fragments of welded tuff origin; soil reaction is neutral throughout
Riggins soils  dry for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice
Shinn soils  4 to 10 inches to a lithic contact (basalt)
Wahoo soils  dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice; particle-size control section has 50 to 85 percent angular and subangular rock fragments

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Reilloc soils are on plateaus at elevations of 2,600 to 3,800 feet. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in old alluvium from the Ellensburg Formation  and residuum derived from basalt. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. The average January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Berson, Bocker, Klicko and Sienna soils Berson soils on mountains are more than 60 inches deep. Bocker soils on nearby plateaus are very shallow. Klicko soils on nearby plateaus are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and are coarse-loamy. Sienna soils on nearby plateaus are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly bottlebrush squirreltail, snowy phlox, Sandberg bluegrass, eriogonum, hawksbeard, lupine and antelope bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington; MLRA 8. The series is of small extent.
