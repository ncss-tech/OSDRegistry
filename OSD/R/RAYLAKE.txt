RAYLAKE SERIES

The Raylake series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in shale residuum on uplands of the Jackson geological group.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Angelina County, Texas, 1984, Angelina County soil survey area, Texas, 1984. The name is a coined name.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Lacerda or Vaiden series.  The series was separated based on differences in particle size class.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in)  (Bw, Bss horizon) 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in).  (A horizon) 

Cambic horizon: 10 to 130 cm (4 to 51 in).  (Bw, Bss, Bssy horizons)

Densic contact: The contact with Cdy at 130 cm (51 in).  (Cy horizon)
Vertic features: The presence of slickensides at 28 to 130 cm (11 to 51 in).  (Bss, Bssy horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU Data from S80TX-005-012.  Particle-size analysis tests were performed at the project office on one pedon.
