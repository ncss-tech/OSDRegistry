RUEDLOFF SERIES

The Ruedloff series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on hills, benches, and toe slopes.  They formed in alluvium, residuum, and eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees and the mean annual precipitation is 10 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ruedloff loamy coarse sand-on a southwest facing slope of 6 percent in rangeland.  (Colors for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 2 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to weak medium granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

     Bt1--2 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent fine gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

     Bt2--12 to 19 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent fine gravel; slightly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

     Bk1--19 to 24 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 5 percent fine gravel; common concentrations of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

     Bk2--24 to 48 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent fine gravel; common concentrations of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 25 inches thick)

     C--48 to 60 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) coarse sand, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).  (10 to 30 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Moffat County, Colorado; 6 miles east of Powderwash; 2,500 feet west and 1,750 feet south of the northeast corner of Sec. 28, T. 12 N., R. 96 W.  Reservoir Draw USGS quadrangle; Longitude:  108 degrees, 10 minutes, 50 seconds west.  Latitude:  40 degrees, 58 minutes, 26 seconds north.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: aridic regime bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cotha, Ryan Park, and Ryark series.
Cotha soils have a paralithic contact.
Ryan Park soils do not have C horizons with sandy textures.
Ryark soils do not have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ruedloff soils are on hills, benches, and toe slopes and have slopes of 1 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in coarse textured alluvium, residuum, and eolian deposits derived from sandstone. Parent materials are associated with Wasatch Formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 11 inches and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year.  June and July are the months of lowest precipitation during the growing season.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 95 days.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 6,500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hiatha, Kandaly, and Simanni soils.  Kandaly soils do not have an argillic horizon, are in a sandy family, and are on hillcrests.  Hiatha soils are shallow to shale bedrock, are in a fine family, and are on hills.  Simanni soils are in the fine-loamy family, and are on the same topographic position.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, shadscale, needleandthread, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ruedloff soils occur in northwestern Colorado, MLRA 34A.   The series is of small extent.
