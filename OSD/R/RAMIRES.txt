RAMIRES SERIES

The Ramires series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, andesite and rhyolite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Ramires soils are on hill and mountain side slopes and fan piedmonts with a rock core.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Calciargidic Argixerolls

     R--86 to 91 cm; partially weathered tuff with carbonate coatings in cracks.

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about one mile south of Safford Canyon; about 2,000 feet east and 40 feet north of the southwest corner of section 15, T. 31 N., R. 51 E.; USGS Palisade 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 33 minutes 44 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 12 minutes 54 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.5622222 latitude, -116.2150000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry mid-June to mid-October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 20 to 38 cm and commonly includes the upper Bt horizons.
Depth to the base of the Bt horizon: 50 to 90 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 60 to 100 cm.
Other features: Some pedons lack Bk horizons, but have a lower Btk subhorizon that extends to the bedrock, or have Btk horizons above the Bk.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments:  Up to 35 percent, mainly gravel with some cobbles.

A horizon 
Chroma:  1 through 3.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt and Btk horizons
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Gravelly clay, gravelly sandy clay, gravelly clay loam, clay loam or clay.  Some pedons have a thin subhorizon of very gravelly clay above the lithic contact.
Structure:  Weak to strong medium or coarse subangular blocky, weak or moderate fine to coarse prismatic.
Consistence:  Hard or very hard, friable or firm, sticky or very sticky, plastic or very plastic.
Reaction:  Neutral through moderately alkaline.
Other features:  The lower Bt subhorizons of some pedons contain secondary carbonates.

Bk horizon (when present)
Value: 4 through 7 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Texture:  Sandy clay loam or sandy loam.
Rock fragments:  10 to 50 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Drakesflat and Marack series.  

Drakesflat soils mollic epipedon does not include the upper part of the Bt horizon and has a Bk with a texture of loam or clay loam.  Marack soils are greater than 100 cm to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ramires soils are on hill and mountain side slopes and fan piedmont remnants with a rock core.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from tuff, rhyolite, and andesite with a component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Creva, Chen, Singletree, Slaven and Taylor Creek soils.  Creva soils have an ochric epipedon and a loamy-skeletal Bt horizon interrupted by a lithic contact.  Chen soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section and have a lithic contact within a depth of 50 cm.  Singletree soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Slaven soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section and lack a Bk horizon.  Taylor Creek soils have a 30 to 46 cm thick A horizon, abrupt textural boundary between the A and Bt horizon, argillic horizon with more than 60 percent clay, and mean summer soil temperatures of less than 15 degrees C.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, lupine, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral and northeastern Nevada.  MLRA 24, 25 and 28B.  These soils are moderately extensive.
