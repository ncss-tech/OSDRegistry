RIVERPOINT SERIES

The Riverpoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks mixed with lacustrine sediments in the upper part. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent in mountain valleys and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

Balake and Keuterville soils have an argillic horizon to a depth of 60 inches or more. In addition, Keuterville soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days. Beezee soils have a mollic epipedon 15 to 20 inches thick and a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 53 degrees F. Bluesprin, Jellico Shanks and Sienna soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Fordice soils do not have an activity class designated, but have greater than 40 percent rock fragments throughout the solum and a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F. Hunsinger soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a weathered basalt paralithic contact. Jebe soils have an argillic horizon to a depth of 40 to 60 inches or more and are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days. Legall soils have a mollic epipedon 15 to 20 inches thick, a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 53 degrees F. and an argillic horizon to a depth of 60 inches or more. Nashmead soils are dry more than 90 days and have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F. Sauter have an argillic horizon to a depth of 40 to 60 inches or more and a mollic epipedon 15 to 20 inches thick. Tekoa soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Riverpoint soils are gently sloping to moderately steep on shoulders and risers of relict lakebed terraces and convex areas of fan remnants at elevations of 2,950 to 3,900 feet. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rocks (dominantly granodiorite) mixed with lacustrine sediments in the upper part. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hellake and Stardust soils. These soils are fine-loamy and occur on less convex geomorphic positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Riverpoint soils are used mainly for irrigated hayland/pasture and woodland grazing. Some areas are used for homesites. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine and common snowberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 44. Riverpoint soils are of small extent.
