ROWDEN SERIES

The Rowden series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous, loamy and clayey residuum and/or slope alluvium derived from limestone bedrock. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on ridges and hills on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Argiustolls

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Callahan, Hensley, Leeray, Lindy, Lueders, Palopinto, Set, Throck, Speck, and Valera series. 
Callahan, Set, and Throck soils: occur on more sloping areas and formed in claystone
Hensley, Lueders, Palopinto, and Speck soils: occur on similar to higher positions and are less than 51 cm (20 in) deep to bedrock
Leeray soils: occur on lower positions, do not have argillic horizons and have intersecting slickensides
Lindy soils: occur on similar positions
Valera soils: occur on lower positions and do not have argillic horizons

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is medium on slopes less than 1 percent and high on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Dominantly used as rangeland, but in some areas sizable amounts are cultivated with small grains as the main crop. The native vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses with scattered live oak trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Texas; LRR - H; MLRA 78A - Rolling Limestone Prairie and MLRA 80B - Texas North Central Prairie. The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Callahan County, Texas; 1979.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Lindy series.

Edited 01/2017 (RFG-ROG): Changed to tabular format. Added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 20 to 69 cm (8 to 27 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in). (A and Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 20 to 69 cm (8 to 27 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Lithic contact: 69 cm (27 in). (R horizon)
Other: the clay increase from the Ap to the Bt1 horizon is insufficient for the Paleustolls great group. Depth to identifiable secondary carbonates is 38 cm (15 in).
