ROCKBRIDGE SERIES

The Rockbridge series consist of well drained soils very deep to sandstone. These soils formed in the loess, in pedisediments, and in the loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone. These soils are on the hills in bedrock controlled uplands. Permeability is moderate in the loess, slow to moderate in the clayey pedisediment, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy residuum and slow to moderate in the sandstone. Slope ranges from 6 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation about 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Wisconsin. MLRA 105. This series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richland County, Wisconsin, 1947. Source of the name is a village in Richland County. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 6 inches;
Albic horizon--the zone from 6 to 8 inches;
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 35 inches;
Paralithic contact--the contact with glauconitic sandstone at 70 inches. 

The Rockbridge series was classified as Gray Brown Podzolic soils in recently published soil surveys. 

Type Location was visited on November 11, 2001 to verify and add residuum and glauconitic sandstone in the lower part of the profile.
