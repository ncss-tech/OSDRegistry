REXVILLE SERIES

The Rexville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Holocene age. These nearly level soils occur on flats on river and stream terraces on the coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).

SERIES PROPOSED: Austin County, Texas, 2018. The name is from a small community in southwest Austin County.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Aris series. The series was separated based on classification and landform.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
  Particle-size control section: 59 to 109 cm (23 to 43 in) (upper Bt1 horizon)
  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 59 cm (0 to 23 in) (A1 and A2 horizons) 
  Argillic horizon: 59 to 203 cm (23 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
  Aquic conditions: 41 to 115 cm (16 to 45 in)

Additional Comments:  
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by MLRA Soil Survey Office laboratory data number S2017TX0152001 from Austin County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: MLRA Soil Survey Office laboratory data from type location S2017TX0152001. Additional article-size analysis, salinity and sodicity tests were performed at the project office on pedons S2018TX0154100, S2000TX0159007, S2000TX9005, S2000TX0159003.
