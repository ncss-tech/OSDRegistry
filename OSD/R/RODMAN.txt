RODMAN SERIES

The Rodman series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that are shallow to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The Rodman soils formed in sandy and gravelly outwash. They are on kames, eskers, moraines, outwash plains, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Rodman sandy loam, on a 45 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of about 171 meters (560 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches); black (10YR 2/1) sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; 14 percent rock fragments; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bw--25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam; weak medium granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; 35 percent rock fragments; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [8 to 23 cm (3 to 9 inches) thick]

 C--46 to 203 cm (18 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; 50 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Fountain County, Indiana; about 1 mile south and 1 mile west of Attica; 80 feet north and 200 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 13, T. 21 N., R. 8 W.; USGS Williamsport, Indiana topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 15 minutes 29.7 seconds N. and long. 87 degrees 16 minutes 49.3 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 476158 easting and 4456462 northing, NAD 83.

Rock fragment content: 35 to 78 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in closely related families are the Alpena, Casco, Kars, Kiva, and Lorenzo series. Alpena and Kiva soils have a frigid soil temperature regime. Casco and Kars soils do not have a mollic epipedon and have an argillic horizon. Lorenzo soils have an argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rodman soils are on kames, eskers, moraines, outwash plains, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent. The soils formed in sandy and gravelly outwash. They are shallow to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The climate is midcontinental with hot summers and cold winters. Mean annual precipitation is 711 to 1397 mm (28 to 55 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 13 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 152 to 305 meters (500 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Casco, Fabius, Fox, Lorenzo, Miami, Mussey, Ockley, and Warsaw soils. The Rodman soils are in a drainage sequence with the somewhat excessively drained Casco soils, the somewhat poorly drained Fabius soils, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Mussey soils. In prairie areas, the well drained Warsaw soils are closely associated on similar positions. In other areas, the well drained Fox, Lorenzo, and Ockley soils and the moderately well drained Miami soils are associated on similar topographic positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained. The potential for surface runoff is very low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used chiefly for forest or woodlots with a considerable proportion in permanent pasture. A very small proportion is cropped.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Wisconsin, Indiana, western Ohio, and northeastern Illinois; MLRAs 95A, 95B, 97, 98, 108B, 110, 111A, 111D, and 114A. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of moderate extent.
