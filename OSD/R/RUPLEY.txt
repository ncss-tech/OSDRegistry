RUPLEY SERIES

The Rupley series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in noncalcareous sandy sediments derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These gently sloping soils are on terraces of coastal plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Hyperthermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rupley fine sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); brown (10YR 4/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose; common fine roots; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 cm [4 to 10 in] thick)

     A2--20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; single grain; loose; few fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 cm [0 to 15 in] thick)

     C1--(51 to 158 cm (20 to 62 in); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; single grain; loose; few fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (51 to 152 cm [20 to 60 in] thick)

     C2--158 to 203 cm (62 to 80 in); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; few medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) and few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) mottles; single grain; loose; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Victoria County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S.  Highway 77 and Loop 175 southwest of Victoria, 1.38 miles south on U.S.  Highway 77, and 220 feet west in rangeland.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Gainesville (FL) and Lake (FL) series.  Similar soils are the Galveston, Falfurrias and Kuy series.

Gainesville and Lake soils: receive more than 1270 mm (50 in) of annual precipitation.  
Galveston soils: are on undulating coastal terraces and barrier islands 1.2 to 7.6 m (4 to 25 ft) above the mean tide, are more alkaline and contain marine shell fragments throughout, and have mixed mineralogy.  
Falfurrias soils: are dry in the moisture control section for 90 or more cumulative days in most years and have mixed mineralogy.  
Kuy soils: have argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: sandy alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock
Landscape: river valleys on coastal plains
Landform: terraces
Slope: 1 to 5 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 20.6 to 21.7 degrees C (69 to 71 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1143 mm (37 to 43 in)
Frost-free period: 240 to 300 days
Elevation: 15 to 76 m (50 to 250 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P	E indices: 46 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dacosta, Edna, Faddin, Fordtran, Kuy, and Telferner soils.
Dacosta, Edna, Faddin, Fordtran and Telferner soils: are in the same landscape eon a slightly higher position and have a clayey argillic horizon.  
Kuy soils: are on a lower position on terraces; have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained. Permeability is rapid.  Runoff is negligible. These soils are saturated starting at a depth of 152 cm (6 ft) in normal years during the winter and early spring months

USE AND VEGETATION:  Range is the main land use.  Native vegetation includes little bluestem, purpletop triden, brownseed paspalum, live oak and post oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Prairieof Texas; Land Resource Region: T; MLRA: Gulf Coast Prairie (MLRS 150A).  The series is of minor extent.
