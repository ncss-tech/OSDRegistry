ROLIE SERIES

The Rolie series consists of very shallow and shallow to hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone on hills. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Ustic Petrocalcids 
TYPICAL PEDON: Rolie very gravelly loam on a slope facing south at 6035 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
A--0 to 1 inch; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)
Bk1--1 to 4 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent calcium carbonate coated gravel; strongly effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)
Bk2--4 to 9 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent calcium carbonate coated gravel and 20 percent coated cobble; violently effervescent, 16 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)
Bkm1--9 to 15 inches; fractured, indurated hardpan with roots and soil material in fractures; abrupt smooth boundary.
Bkm2--15 to 60 inches; indurated hardpan.
TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; on the Hualapai Indian Reservation; 1800 feet east and 1000 feet south of the northwest corner of section 1, T. 29 N., R. 6 W.
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 3 months cumulative during December-March and intermittently moist in some parts during July-September. Driest during May and June. Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil temperature: 55 to 58 degrees F.
Rock fragments: Averages 0 to 35 percent gravel and cobble
Depth to petrocalcic horizon: 6 to 20 inches
Thick alluvial deposits occur below the hardpan
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline
Calcium carbonate: Strongly to violently effervescent - disseminated and as coatings on rock fragments
Calcium carbonate equivalence: 10 to 30 percent and is assumed to be inherited from the parent material
Clay content: Averages 20 to 27 percent (Loam or Silt loam)
A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4, 5, or 6 dry, 3, 4, or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist
B horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4, 5, or 6 dry, 3, 4, or 5 dry
Chroma: 3 or 4 moist
COMPETING SERIES: These are the Pastern (UT), Pastura (NM), Promontory (AZ), and Tassi (AZ) soils. Pastern soils average less than 18 percent clay. Pastura soils are driest in the fall and winter months and more moist in the spring. Promontory soils have rhyolite bedrock immediately below the hardpan. Tassi soils have limestone bedrock immediately below the hardpan. 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rolie soils are on summits and backslopes of hills. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevations are 4,500 to 6,100 feet. The Rolie soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. More than 50 percent of the precipitation falls as gentle rain or snow in winter and the remainder as intense summer thunderstorms. The frost-free period is 135 to 175 days.
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Poley and Disterheff soils. Both soils do not have petrocalcic horizons and are very deep.
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderate permeability.
USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is blue grama, needleandthread, fourwing saltbush and winterfat.
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona. The Rolie soils are moderately extensive. MLRA is 35.
