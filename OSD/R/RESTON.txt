RESTON SERIES

The Reston series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from greenstone.  Reston soils are on narrow, rounded ridgetops and convex sideslopes and have slopes ranging from 3 to 75 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and mean annual preicipitation is about 45 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Reston loam - on a 30 percent, convex, west-facing slope in an improved pasture.  (When described, the soils were dry. Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate very fine and fine granular and moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine continuous interstitial and tubular pores; 5 percent weathered greenstone gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt--2 to 7 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine continuous interstitial and tubular pores; common faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent weathered greenstone gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    R--7 inches; fractured greenstone; few fine roots commonly penetrate fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Oregon; about 6 miles east of Winston off County Highway No. 16; 300 feet north and 300 feet west of the SE corner of section 16, T. 28 S., R. 5 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, but is dry throughout the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to hard bedrock is 5 to 10 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.

The A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.

The Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or gravelly loam, averaging 18 to 27 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the McMullin soils.  This soil has a lithic contact at a depth of 12 to 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reston soils are on narrow ridgetops, convex nose slopes and hillslopes at elevations of 300 to 3,200 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metavolcanic greenstone.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and dry warm summers.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F., and the annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nonpareil, Panther, Pengra, and Speaker soils and the competing McMullin soils.  Nonpareil soils have an ochric epipedon and are 10 to 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Panther soils are poorly drained and more than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Pengra soils are fine-loamy over clayey, are more than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are somewhat poorly drained.  Speaker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used primarily for grazing and improved pasture.  Native vegetation is Oregon white oak, madrone, Douglas-fir, poison oak, sweetbriar rose and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Interior valleys and low mountainous areas of the Klamath and Western Cascade Mountains in southwestern Oregon.  MLRA 5. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: The superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the classification in 10/2005. The competing series section was not updated at that time. Last revision 3/1995.
