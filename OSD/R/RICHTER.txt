RICHTER SERIES

The Richter series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy glaciofluvial deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, and glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Argic Endoaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Richter sandy loam, on a north-facing, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 cm (6 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [(5 to 8 inches) thick]

 Bs--15 to 33 cm (6 to 13 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy sand; very weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; many roots; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

 B/E--33 to 41 cm (13 to 16 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) sandy loam (Bt); occupies about 85 percent of the horizon surrounded by or penetrated by tongues of brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand (E); weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly sticky; many roots; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. [5 to 13 cm (2 to 5 inches) thick]

 Bt--41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) stratified sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand, and thin layers of silty clay loam and sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly sticky; common fine roots; few faint clay films; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) masses of oxidized iron; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; slightly acid; abrupt boundary. [0 to 51 cm (20 inches) thick]

 C--66 to 127 cm (26 to 50 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stratified loamy sand, sandy loam and loamy fine sand, and thin layers of sand and silty clay loam; massive; friable; many medium distinct light brown (7.5YR 6/4) and prominent reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) masses of oxidized iron; many medium prominent pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) iron depletions; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Osceola County, Michigan; 1,180 feet north and 250 feet west of center of sec. 3, T. 20 N., R. 7 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 inches)
Series control section: thickness and sequence of layers of sandy loam and loamy sand in the solum and C horizon varies within short horizontal distances; thickness of sand and silty clay loam layer ranges from 13 mm to 8 cm (1/2 to 3 inches) 
Argillic horizon: 10 to 22 percent clay
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent throughout 

A horizon, where present:
Thickness: 2.5 to 20 cm (1 to 8 inches)
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

E horizon, where present, and the E part of the B/E horizon:
Thickness: 2.5 to 20 cm (1 to 8 inches)
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 or 7
Chroma: 1 to 3

Bt part of the B/E horizon and the Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5

Texture: stratified with textures of sandy loam to silty clay loam; clay loam and silty clay loam strata are thin
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 
Chroma: 2 to 4
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline
Texture: stratified sand to silt loam, with thin bands of silty clay loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Charlevoix and Coral series. Charlevoix and Coral soils do not have stratified textures in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Richter soils are on lake plains, outwash plains, and glacial drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Richter soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 838 mm (27 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 8.3 degrees C (40 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Alcona soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Tonkey soils are in a drainage sequence with Richter soils. The Brimley and Gladwin soils are nearby in some areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between October and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part of this soil is used for forest or permanent pasture. Forested areas are chiefly in swamp oak, alder and willow and shrubs and grasses. Some small areas of this soil are under cultivation to small grain, sugar beets, beans, hay and corn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 92, 93B, 94A, 94C, 96, and 98 in northern Michigan and northern Wisconsin. This series is of moderate extent.
