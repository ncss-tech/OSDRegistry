COMPETING SERIES: These are the Marysslough (AK) soils. 
Marysslough soils occur at elevations of 0 to 8 m (0 to 26 ft) on flood plains and the leeward side of coast berms in shore complexes.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dackey (AK), Drashner (AK), Slimecreek (AK), and Sonderna (AK) series. 
Dackey soils are somewhat poorly drained, have fine sandy loam surface horizon over stratified alluvium, and occur on floodplains and low stream terraces.
Drashner soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a histic epipedon, and occur on mountains and hillslopes.
Slimecreek soils are somewhat poorly drained, have aquic conditions starting between 14 and 39 cm (6 and 15 in) deep, and occur on floodplains in mountains.
Sonderna soils have an umbric epipedon, and occur on alluvial fans and fan terraces in mountains.
