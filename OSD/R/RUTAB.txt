RUTAB SERIES

The Rutab series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Rutab soils are on fan skirts and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rutab loam==rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 15 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 cm thick)

    Bw--15 to 28 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 28 cm thick)

    2Bw--28 to 56 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 36 cm thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the  Oreneva, Packham and Rinconflat series.  

Oreneva soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Packham and Rinconflat soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rutab soils are on fan skirts and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,555 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coils, Handy and Pedoli soils.  Coils soils have an argillic horizon with more than 35 percent clay and have a duripan at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Handy soils have an argillic horizon with more than 35 percent clay.  Pedoli soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, small rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, Thurber needlegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.  Some areas are seeded to crested wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada and Southeastern Oregon.  These soils are not extensive.
