REVLING SERIES

The Revling series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments with a thick volcanic ash mantle. They are on hills and ridges on plateaus and structural benches and footslopes on mountains. Permeability is slow and slopes range from 5 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Revling soils are on hills and ridges on plateaus and structural benches and footslopes on mountains at elevations of 2,800 to 3,550 feet. Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent. These soils are formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. The average annual air temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches. The frost free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grangemont, Jaype, Kauder, and Statemeadow series. Grangemont soils are on plateaus and are fine-silty. Jaype soils are on plateaus and have a thin ash mantle. Kauder soils are on plateaus and have a fragipan. Statemeadow soils are on plateaus and have a highly mixed ash mantle.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used primarily for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and watershed. The natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas fir, western larch and western white pine with an understory of queencup beadlilly, wild ginger, goldthread, oneleaf foamflower, longtube twinflower and Utah honeysuckle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho, Revling soils are not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
