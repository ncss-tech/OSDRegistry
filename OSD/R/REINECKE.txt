REINECKE SERIES

The Reinecke series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum from andesite.  Reinecke soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, mesic Typic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Reinecke sandy loam on a 2 percent slope, forested.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--2 inches to 0; partially decomposed needles and twigs.

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel-size cinders; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 9 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 29 inches thick)

    2ABb--25 to 33 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bwb--33 to 60 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) cobbly loam, brown (5YR 5/4) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Oregon; about 4 miles east of Prospect; approximately 2,275 feet east and 775 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 25, T. 32 S., R. 3 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reinecke soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils have a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter, and an estimated phosphate retention of more than 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 0.4 percent, and volcanic glass of more than 60 percent in the ashy overlay.  Thickness of the ashy materials and depth to contrasting materials range from 20 to 40 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam with 5 to 25 percent gravel size cinders.

The 2AB horizon, when present has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam with 10 to 20 percent clay and has 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.

The 2B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It is cobbly loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 25 percent are gravel and 0 to 20 percent are cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cupper (T) and Wolot series.  Cupper and Wolot soils are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days, have an ashy mantle having silt loam textures, and the buried soil has hue of 10YR.  In addition, Cupper soils have secondary carbonates within the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Reinecke series consists of very deep, well drained soils on plateaus.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum from andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are 2,600 to 3,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alcot, Coyota, Crater Lake, and Dumont soils.  Alcot soils are ashy-pumiceous and lack a buried soil.   Coyota soils are loamy-skeletal and moderately deep.  Dumont soils are fine and lack an ash overlay.  Crater Lake soils are ashy and lack a buried soil.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production. Native overstory vegetation includes Douglas fir, white fir, western hemlock, incense cedar, Pacific madrone and sugar pine.  Understory includes cascade Oregongrape, twin flower, princes pine, dogwood, vine maple, deerfoot vanillaleaf, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Oregon; MLRA 5.  The series is inextensive.

REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from Ashy over loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Vitrandepts based on the Andisol Order.

Diagnostic horizons and features:

Ochric epipedon - moist chroma of 4 from 3 to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 25 inches (Bw horizon).

Particle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches with the upper 0 to 25 inches meeting ashy family criteria (A1, A2, Bw horizons) and the lower 25 to 40 inches meeting loamy family criteria (2ABb and upper 7 inches of 2Bwb horizon)
