RICEVILLE SERIES

The Riceville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 35 to 75 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying till.  These soils are on convex side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Howard County, Iowa, 1965.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 38 to 88 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (Ap, E, and EB horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 107 centimeters (Btg1, 2Btg2, and 2Btg3 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
