ROCKISLAND SERIES

The Rockisland series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Rockisland loam, in rangeland on a 40 percent slope at an elevation of 2262 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

  A--0 to 11 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 24 cm thick)

  Bw--11 to 26 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 35 cm thick)

  Bk1--26 to 61 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, 5 percent medium, distinct, irregular, soft masses of calcium carbonate, and 90 percent distinct calcium carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 50 cm thick)

  Bk2--61 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, 10 percent medium, distinct, irregular, soft masses of calcium carbonate, and 65 percent distinct calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments;  violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.
