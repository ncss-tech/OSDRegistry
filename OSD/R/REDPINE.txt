REDPINE SERIES

The Redpine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous calcareous sandstone, and siltstone.  These soils are on backslopes and shoulders of hills.  Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes range from 8 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.   

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Redpine loam, rangeland; on a 12 percent slope at an elevation of 6,400 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    AB--4 to 10 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--10 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common discontinuous faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--16 to 22 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent paragravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt1 and Bt2 is 10 to 18 inches)

    Bk--22 to 26 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) paragravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; lime is disseminated and as thin coats surrounding of paragravel; 15 percent paragravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    2Cr--26 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) weakly consolidated ash.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bess, Border (I), Cedarpoint, Chesnimnus, Fewkes, Justesen, McCarey, Pegram (T), Pinehollow (T), Vickings, and Victon series. Bess, Border, Cedarpoint, Chesnimnus, Fewkes, Justesen, Pegram, and  Vicking soils are very deep.  McCarey and Pinehollow soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Vickton soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: back slopes and shoulders of hills
Elevation: 5,900 to 6,900 feet
Slope: 8 to 25 percent
Parent Material:  alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous calcareous sandstone or siltstone of the Salt Lake Formation.
Climate: long, cool winters; dry, warm summers
Average annual precipitation: 12 to 20 inches
Average annual temperature: 39 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brushtop (T), Burchert (T),  Draney (T), and Whitetop (T) soils.  Brushtop soils are deep to weakly consolidated ash, occupy north-facing aspects and are cryic.  Burchert soils are moderately deep to weakly and moderately consolidated tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone, lack a calcic horizon, and occupy similar landscape positions.  Draney soils are shallow, are calcareous throughout, and occupy convex shoulder positions.  Whitetop soils are shallow, formed in residuum from weakly consolidated ash, and occupy shoulders, summits and upper backslopes.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat and rangeland.  The dominant native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, serviceberry, common snowberry, antelope bitterbrush, eriogonum, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, and bluegrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The series is not extensive. MLRA 43B.
