RICKMORE SERIES

The Rickmore series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy calcareous material of eolian origin. These soils are on nearly level and gently sloping uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

Dallam, Gruver and Perico soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Sherm soils: have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately slow permeability.  Surface runoff is very low on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for cropland but also used as native rangeland and wildlife habitat. Principal crops are grain sorghum and wheat. Native vegetation is blue grama, buffalograss, sideoats grama, vine mesquite, sand dropseed, and sand sagebrush.  This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077BY021TX) and the Sandy (R077BY658TX) ecological sites in MLRA-77B.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North of the Canadian River in Northwest Texas, adjoining areas in New Mexico and Oklahoma.  The series is moderately extensive
