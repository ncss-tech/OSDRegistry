TYPE LOCATION:  Lassen County, California; about 1 mile NW of Lake Leavitt, 0.6 mile W of Buffum Lane and about 1900 feet S of HWY 395; about 2,000 feet E and 2,700 feet N of the SW corner of section 17, T.29 N., R.13 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 50 to 53 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 19 inches.  Organic carbon decreases regularly with depth and is less than 0.6 percent below a depth of 20 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 16 to 20 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section has a weighted average of 25 to 35 percent clay and 6 to 12 percent fine sand or coarser.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam.  These soils are saturated between the depths of 20 and 40 inches from December through June.  The soil moisture control section (5 to 13 inches) is dry throughout from June 15th to November 15th (153 days).  It is moist in some or all parts the remainder of the year.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 15th to December 1st (261 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from May 1st to November 15th (198 days).

The A horizon dry color is (10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3).  Moist color is (10YR 2/1, 3/2 or 3/3.)  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  E.C. ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos. SAR ranges from 5 to 12 percent.

The Bk horizons dry colors are (10YR 7/2, 8/2 or 2.5Y 8/2).  Moist colors are (2.5Y 5/4, 6/4 or 10YR 6/4).  Calcium carbonate equivalent decreases with depth and ranges from 25 to 40 percent in the upper part and 15 to 25 percent in the lower part.  E.C. ranges from 4 to 8 mmhos in the upper part and 2 to 8 mmhos in the lower part.  SAR ranges from 5 to 30 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rices soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in lacustrine sediments and mixed alluvium.   Elevation ranges from 4050 to 4150 feet.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 9 to 12 inches including 10 to 20 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F and the mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F.
