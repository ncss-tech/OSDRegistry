REDSPOON SERIES

The Redspoon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Redspoon soils are on pediments in intermontane basins.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Redspoon loamy fine sand - on an 8 percent slope in an area of rangeland at an elevation of 9,120 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on June 21, 1988. Reactions are field-measured.

    A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw1--8 to 12 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) parachannery very fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent parachanners; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw2--12 to 25 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) extremely parachannery very fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 65 percent parachanners; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Crk--25 to 35 inches; few fine calcium carbonate masses; moderately cemented sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Branham, Clergern, Danielvil, Dinnen, Levenmile, Martland, Sawcreek, Sula, and Teoculli series.
The Clergern, Danielvil, Dinnen, Levenmile, Sula, and Teoculli soils are very deep.
Branham soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.
Martland soils have rock fragments of granodiorite, gneiss, and schist.
Sawcreek soils do not border an aridic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: slope alluvium from sandstone, typically the Pennsylvanian-age Minturn Formation.
Landform: pediments
Slopes: 2 to 20 percent
Elevation: 8,700 to 10,000 feet
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 39 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 16 inches
Precipitation pattern: Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period: 50 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cablon and Chubbs series.  Cablon soils are very deep, are sandy-skeletal in the particle-size control section, have a calcic horizon, and are on outwash terraces.  Chubs soils are shallow to sandstone.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Arizona fescue, slimstem muhly, prairie junegrass, western wheatgrass, blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Intermontane basins and valleys of Colorado; MLRA 48B.  The series is of small extent.
