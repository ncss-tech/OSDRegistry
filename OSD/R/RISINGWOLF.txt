RISINGWOLF SERIES 

The Risingwolf series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium, till, outwash or landslide deposits over residuum derived from metasedimentary rock. These soils occur on moraines, outwash terraces, glacial-valley walls, glacial-valley floors, mountain slopes, colluvial aprons, cirque platforms and landslides. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,825 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 2.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Andic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Risingwolf very gravelly ashy silt loam, in coniferous forest. This pedon was described on a 4 percent slope at 1,469 meters elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Oi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    Oe--2 to 5 cm; moderately decomposed forest litter.

    Bw1--16 to 36 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly medial loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 65 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    2Bw2--36 to 70 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    2C--70 to 152 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).
