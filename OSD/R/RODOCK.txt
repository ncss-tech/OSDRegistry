RODOCK SERIES

The Rodock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of loess and volcanic ash.  The Rodock soils are on inset fans, fan aprons, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Duridic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rodock gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

TYPE LOCATION:  Humboldt County, Nevada; approximately one mile northwest of the Kings River Ranch headquarters; about 300 feet north and 2500 feet east of the southwest corner of section 16, T. 46 N., R. 33 E.; USGS Kings River Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 51 minutes 46 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 15 minutes 34 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.8627778 latitude, -118.2761111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, October to late June.  Dry from mid-July to mid-October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon: 25 to 48 cm thick.
Depth to continuous brittle matrix: 50 to 76 cm.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 50 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon 
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bw horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture: Loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
Clay content: 15 to 25 percent.
Rock fragment: 0 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.
Reaction:  Neutral through moderately alkaline.

Bq and Bqk horizons
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Stratified; the upper part is loam to gravelly sandy loam and the lower part is very gravelly loam to extremely gravelly coarse sand.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.
Consistence:  Subhorizons have continuous brittle matrix; strongly cemented durinodes and coarse masses or pendants are in most pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rodock soils are on inset fans, fan aprons and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,300 to 1,800 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hunnton, Kingsriver, and Rio King series.  Hunnton soils have clay argillic horizons and duripans.  Kingsriver and Rio King soils have coarse-loamy control sections and lack layers of silica cementation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly basin big sagebrush, rabbitbrush and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 23, 24.
