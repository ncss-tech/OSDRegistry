RACINE SERIES

The Racine series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 30 to 66 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and in the underlying glacial till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Mollic subgroup based on colors and thickness of the ochric epipedon.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data (NSSL).
