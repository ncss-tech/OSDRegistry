RAZTACK SERIES

The Raztack series consists of deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Raztack soils are on depressions on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Raztack soils are on depressions on lakebeds. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,460 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6.5 to 7.5 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Embal, Millenium, Stauffer, and Silverash soils. Embal, Millenium, and Stauffer soils are ashy, very deep, and have mollic epipedons. Silverash soils have depth to the base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 74 cm and have aquic conditions in the A horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; negligible surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils have endosaturation at a depth of 100 to 150 cm below the surface and episaturation from the surface to 15 cm below the surface at some time between February through April; they are susceptible to frequent ponding for brief duration from February through April with water up to 10 cm deep. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Raztack soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 360 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
