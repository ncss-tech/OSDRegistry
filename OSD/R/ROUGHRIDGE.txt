ROUGHRIDGE SERIES

The Roughridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite with additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Roughridge soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cabinspring, Cagas, Derallo, Glassbutte, Jacksplace and Slockey soils.  

Cabinspring, Cagas, Derallo, Jacksplace and Slockey soils have bedrock within 150 cm.  Glassbutte soils lack accumulations of secondary silica. In addition, all of these soils have more than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roughridge soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on convex crest, shoulder and backslope positions.  The majority of the precipitation occurs as snow, much of which is removed from the surface of the soil through wind action.  This removal of snow greatly reduces the effective precipitation on this soil relative to surrounding non-convex areas.  They formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.   Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,445 to 3,115 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hardshoulder and Lastsummer series.  Hardshoulder and Lastsummer soils have xeric soil moisture regimes, cryic soil temperature regimes and have mollic epipedons greater than 41 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Roughridge soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, buckwheat, pine needlegrass, prairie junegrass, gilia and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
