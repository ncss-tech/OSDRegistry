RESOLANA SERIES

The Resolana series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from granitic fanglomerate. Resolana soils are on north-facing backslopes of eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Espadon, Luckystrike, Traley, and Truehill series.
Espadon soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Luckystrike soils have Bkq horizons with silica coats and greater than 20 percent carbonate content.  Traley soils are deep to limestone bedrock and have an ustic aridic moisture regime. Truehill soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 52 degrees and 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Resolana soils are on backslopes of eroded fan remnants. They formed in colluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from Tertiary granitic fanglomerate. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crucitas, Encantado, Levante, and Nazario soils. Crucitas soil are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal, lack argillic and calcic horizons, and occur on low stream terraces of valley floors. Levante soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains of valley floors. Encantado soils are sandy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes of eroded fan remnants generally on adjacent south-facing slopes. Nazario soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on narrow beveled summits of eroded fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high runoff; permeability is moderate in the subsoil, moderately rapid in the substratum, and very slow in the underlying bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Resolana soils are used for cordwood production, urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, New Mexico feathergrass, galleta, sideoats grama, oneseed juniper, and twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Juniperus monosperma-Pinus edulis/Fallugia parodoxa-Chrysothamnus nauseosus/Bouteloua hirsuta-Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB136NM).. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Resolana soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
