COMPETING SERIES: These are the Coppercenter, Goldenorth, and Tseenjik soils.
Coppercenter soils have a mollic epipedon and permafrost starting below 50 cm (20 in).
Goldennorth soils are very poorly drained, have a loess cap over gravely till, and occur on hillslopes in valleys.
Tseenjik soils have permafrost starting below 50 cm (20 in) and occur on floodplains at elevations between 90 and 220 m (295 and 720 ft).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation: 400 to 800 meters (1310 to 2625 feet)
Parent material: mossy organic material over sandy alluvium
Landform: till plains, flats
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 300 to 1400 mm (12 to 55 in)
Mean annual air temperature: -5 to -1 degrees C. (23 to 30 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 60 to 103 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ganhona, Haleycreek, Hundell, and Rocklake soils. 
Ganhona soils are well drained, has stratified very fine sandy loam to silt loam surface texture, and occur on river valleys, flood plains, and lacustrine terraces in mountains.
Haleycreek soils are well drained with a cobbly sandy loam surface texture, it has a mollic epipedon, lacks a lithic contact, and occur on hillslopes of mountains and river valleys.
Hundell soils are moderately well drained, with a silt loam surface texture, and occur on flats and bluffs in till plains and outwash plains.
Rocklake soils are shallow to bedrock, lack permafrost, and occur on ridge lines and escarpments.
