RAMPER SERIES

The Ramper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Ramper soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains, and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aridic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Ramper loam, 0 to 3 percent slope, in pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.   (4 to 12 inches thick)

    C--3 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.   (4 to 24 inches thick)

    Ck1--18 to 30 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine soft filaments of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.   (4 to 18 inches thick)

    Ck2--30 to 38 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium platy structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine soft filaments of calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.   (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Ab--38 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).   (0 to 30 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Dolores County, Colorado; about 5 miles southeast of Dove Creek; located about 900 feet west and 2,600 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 30, T. 40 N., R. 18 W.;  USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 42 minutes 01 seconds N. and long. 108 degrees 53 minutes 10 seconds W., NAD27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime: ustic bordering on aridic
Soil temperature regime: mesic
Mean annual soil temperature: 51 degrees F

Particle-size control section: 18 to 35 percent clay

A horizon:
Value: 4 or 5 (3 or 4 moist)
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam or clay loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 (3 or 4 moist)
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or silt loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 10 percent
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aparejo, Haverson, Hickman, Hysham, and Rockypoint series.  Aparejo soils are redder than 7.5YR throughout.  Haverson soils are in MLRA 67 and maximum precipitation is from mid-spring to late autumn.  Hickman soils lack visible secondary carbonates.  Hysham soils are saline-sodic and very strongly alkaline. Rockypoint soils are in MLRA 58 and maximum precipitation is in spring and early autumn.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: alluvium derived from sandstone and shale
Landform: alluvial fans, flood plains, and drainageways
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Elevation: 6,000 to 7,400 feet
Mean annual temperature: 46 to 50 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer. 
Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wetherill, Cahona, and Pulpit series.  Wetherill, Cahona, and Pulpit soils all have argillic horizons.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, low or medium runoff, and moderately slow permeability 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and pasture.  Native vegetation is western wheatgrass, sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)

Particle size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches. (part of the C, the Ck1, Ck2, and part of the Ab horizon)

Carbonates and structure described in the C horizons are depositional and not pedogenic.
