RUNNINGSPRINGS SERIES

The Runningsprings series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granitoid sources. The Runningsprings soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 9 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Runningsprings sandy loam, on a south-facing, convex, 11 percent slope under Jeffrey pine, mountain mahogany, California black oak, manzanita and grasses at an elevation of 2,250 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A -- 0 to 23 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common very fine and fine roots throughout; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw -- 23 to 46 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt broken boundary.

   Cr -- 46 to 66 centimeters; moderately cemented granitoid rock.

COMPETING SERIES:
Skyline soils: have 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are weathered from sedimentary bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: mountains
Landform: mountain slopes
Slopes: 9 to 35 percent
Parent material: residuum from granitoid sources
Elevations: 1,370 to 2,305 meters
Climate: subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with some snow.
Mean annual precipitation: 625 to 1,050 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 13 degrees C.
Frost-free season: 85 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Cedarpines soils: 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact and are on similar landforms.
Hannarocks soils: have a mollic epipedon more than 50 centimeters thick and are on similar landforms.
Garloaf soils: have an argillic horizons and are on alluvial fans.
Canyonspring soils: have an argillic horizon and are on similar landforms.
Pacifico soils: do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landforms.
Waterman soils: 25 to 50 cm to a lithic contact and are on ridges.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Runningsprings soils are used for recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. Some areas are used for homesites. The present vegetation is mainly Jeffrey pine, mountain mahogany, California black oak, manzanita and grasses.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Inland mountain ranges of Southern California Coastal Plains and Mountains, MLRA 19. These soils are of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.
