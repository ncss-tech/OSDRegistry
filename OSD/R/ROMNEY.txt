GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Nassawango soils-well drained with a seasonal water table at a depth of 42 to 72 inches, on higher landforms
Mattapex soils--moderately well drained with a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 to 36 inches, on slightly higher landforms
Othello soils--poorly drained with a seasonal high water table at a depth of 0 to 12 inches and 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section, on lower lying landforms
Elkton soils--poorly drained with a seasonal high water table at a depth of 0 to 12 inches and 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, on lower lying landforms

MAJOR USES: Largely cultivated and used for growing corn, soybeans, and pasture.

VEGETATION: In forested areas, common trees include sweet gum, yellow poplar, willow oak, red maple, and American holly.

DISTRIBUTION: Coastal Plain of Maryland

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Harford County, Maryland, 1998.

REMARKS: Romney soils were previously included with Mattapex, Othello, and Elkton soils.  They are distinguished by being somewhat poorly drained.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 8 inches (A horizon)
Albic horizon--the zone from 4 to 8 inches (E horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 60 inches below the surface (Bt, Btg, and BCg horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 8 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation).

SERIES INTERPRETATION RECORD(S): This series was developed after the termination of the NRCS-SOI-5 form.
