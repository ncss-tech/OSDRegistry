REDUN SERIES

The Redun series consists of very deep, well drained, saline and sodic soils that formed in stream and fan alluvium.  Redun soils are on stream terraces and fan terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 71 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Sodic Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Redun fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Anz--0 to 6 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few fine vesicular pores; noneffervescent; slightly saline (ECe 7dS/m) and strongly sodic (SAR 50); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    Bwn--6 to 12 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; few very fine vesicular pores; few fine, rounded, soft accumulations of lime and salt; violently effervescent; strongly saline (ECe 40 dS/m) and strongly sodic (SAR 85); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 14 inches thick)

    Bnzl--12 to 24 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and common fine vesicular pores; few coarse, rounded, soft accumulations of lime and salt; violently effervescent; strongly saline (ECe 35 dS/m) and strongly sodic (SAR 132); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 22 inches thick)

    Bnz2--24 to 42 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; common very fine vesicular pores; few fine, irregular, soft accumulations of lime and salt; violently effervescent; strongly saline (ECe 30 dS/m) and strongly sodic (SAR 84); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual irregular boundary. (0 to 18 inches thick)

    Bknz--42 to 60 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine pores; many medium, irregular, soft accumulations of lime and salt; violently effervescent; strongly saline (ECe 44 dS/m) and strongly sodic (SAR 96); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Pinal County, Arizona; about 5 miles north of Maricopa, on the Gila River Indian Reservation; 2600 feet north and 1300 feet east of the southwest corner of Section 34, T. 3 S., R. 3 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Usually dry, intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June. Typic aridic moisture regime.

Rock Fragments: 0 to 50 percent in any one horizon; averages less than 35 percent in the particle size control section

The sodium adsorption ratio exceeds 45 throughout the control section.

Carbonates:  Noneffervescent to violently effervescent in the upper part; strongly or violently effervescent in the lower part

A buried soil occurs in some pedons at depths of 40 to 60 inches

A horizon

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redun soils are on stream terraces and fan terraces at elevations of 1000 to 1450 feet.  They formed in Holocene fan or stream alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F.  The frost- free period is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Casa Grande, Kamato and the similar Shontik and Tatai soils.  Casa Grande and Kamato soils have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow or very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and irrigated cropland.  Present vegetation is desert saltbush, linear-leaf saltbush and wolfberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  MLRA is 40. This series is not extensive.
