REBEL SERIES

The Rebel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Rebel soils are on inset fans, fan remnants, fan skirts, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rebel fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(25 to 50 cm thick)

    C2--89 to 152 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common mica flakes; 5 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Humboldt County, Nevada; about 2 miles west and 2.7 miles north of Orovada; 1,800 feet south and 1,800 feet west of the northeast corner of section 9, T. 43 N., R. 37 E.; USGS Orovada 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 37 minutes 21 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 48 minutes 56 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.6225000 latitude, -117.8155556 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to base of cambic horizon: 38 to 60 cm.
Depth to carbonates (non-secondary): 38 to 60 cm.
Mica content: 5 to 20 percent in coarse silt to fine sand fractions; most pedons have few to common mica flakes in a major part of the particle-size control section. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent. 
Sand content: 50 to 80 percent. 
Rock fragments: Averages 2 to 15 percent, mainly gravel. Lithology of fragments is mixed. 

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.
Other features: Slightly effervescent in some pedons due to recharge from calcareous dust.

Bw horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.
Consistence: Soft to slightly hard, dry; friable or very friable, moist; nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic, wet.
Reaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.

C horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Texture: Fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard, dry; nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic, wet. 
Rock fragments: Some pedons contain strata with up to 50 percent gravel.
Consistence: Soft to slightly hard, dry; friable or very friable, moist; nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic, wet.  
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent.
Other features: Subhorizons with texture of coarse sandy loam are common in some pedons. Some pedons have subhorizons with identifiable secondary carbonates below the cambic horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bijorja, Chedehap, Clems, Drewsey, Haybourne, Heist, Irrigon, McClenden, Prosser, Royal, Scooteney, Vining, and Wiehl series. 

Bijorja, Irrigon, Prosser, Vining, and Wiehl soils have bedrock within 100 cm. Chedehap soils have horizons with texture of loamy coarse sand or coarse sand at depths of 64 to 100 cm. Clems and Haybourne soils do not have carbonates within 100 cm. Drewsey and Royal soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates and do not have mica in the particle-size control section. Heist soils lack mica flakes in the particle-size control section. McClenden soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates and have less than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Scooteney soils average 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rebel soils are on inset fans, fan remnants, fan skirts, and stream terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,980 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Davey, McConnel, and Orovada soils. Davey soils are sandy and have cambic horizons. McConnel soils are sandy-skeletal. Orovada soils are coarse-loamy, have cambic horizons, and have Bq horizons containing durinodes in a friable matrix.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very low or low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rebel soils are used for livestock grazing, irrigated cropland, and wildlife habitat.  Alfalfa is the principal crop. The present rangeland vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, black greasewood, bottlebrush squirreltail, basin wildrye, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 24, 25, 26, and 28B.
