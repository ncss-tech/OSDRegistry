ROCKPORT SERIES

The Rockport series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in eolian sands on the Pleistocene age Ingleside Strandplain.  These nearly level or very gently sloping soils are on broad flats and low mounds.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: An ustic soil moisture regime bordering on udic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for less than 120 cumulative days in normal years.  November through April are the driest months, with a second dry period in July, while September is the wettest month.  Although rainfall amounts are that of an ustic moisture regime, the effective precipitation is higher due to relative landscape position and a fluctuating water table.  A water table is present in most pedons within 102 cm (40 in) of the surface in most years for 20 or more consecutive days, or 30 or more cumulative days.

Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 23 degrees C (71 to 73 degrees F).
Depth to redox concentrations: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in)
Depth to redox depletions: 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in)
Depth to endosaturation: 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 in) in most years for a period of two months

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Arenisco, Daggerhill, Falfurrias, Galveston, Greenhill, Padre, Panam, and the Votaw series.
Arenisco soils: have less than 90 percent resistant minerals in the fine earth fraction.
Daggerhill, Falfurrias and Greenhill soils: do not have a water table within 203 cm (80 in) of the surface.
Galveston soils: are dry in the soil moisture control section for less than 90 cumulative days in normal years.
Padre and Panam soils: have less than 5 percent silt plus clay in the control section.
Votaw soils: are in a thermic temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian sands of Ingleside strand plain of late Pleistocene age
Landform: strand plain
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 22 to 23 degrees C (71 to 73 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 686 to 889 mm (27 to 35 in)
Precipitation pattern: November through April are the driest months, with a second dry period in July, with September being the wettest month
Frost-free period: 310 to 330 days
Elevation: 1.5 to 6.1 m (5 to 20 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dianola, Dietrich, Mustang, Narta, and Nueces series.
Dianola soils: poorly drained, have higher water tables for longer periods throughout the year, and are on the strand plain
Dietrich, Narta and Nueces soils: have an argillic horizon and are on higher landforms.
Mustang soils: poorly drained, have higher water tables and are on barrier islands or depressions between dunes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is very low.  The soil in lower elevations near bays or the Laguna Madre is subject to rare flooding from tidal surges from strong tropical storms.  The water table is at 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 in) in most years for a period of two months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of seacoast bluestem, gulfdune paspalum, thin paspalum, and an overstory or scrub or running liveoak.  The ecological site is Coastal Sand, PE 31-44 (150BY648TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B in LRR T) on the Ingleside Strandplain of the Gulf Coast plains of southern Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kleberg County, Texas, 2007.  The name is taken from a nearby community.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Galveston series.  The series are separated based on the difference in soil moisture regime and sand mineralogy.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in). (A1 and A2 horizons)
Particle-size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (A2, C and Cg1 horizons)
Depth to Redox concentrations: 0 to 203 cm (0 t0 80 in). (A1, A2, C, Cg1, Cg2 and Cg3 horizons)
Depth to Redox depletions: 94 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in). (Cg1, Cg2 and Cg3 horizons)
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation at 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 in) in most years for a period of two months.
