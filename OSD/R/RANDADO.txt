RANDADO SERIES

The Randado series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in noncalcareous loamy alluvium over calcareous loamy residuum. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad, low ridges on inland, dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic, shallow Petrocalcic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Randado fine sandy loam in rangeland.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lacoste series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Cuevitas, Delmita, Jimenez, Quemado, Sharvana, and Zapata series.
Lacoste soils: are moist in the soil moisture control section for 90 or more consecutive days in normal years (typic ustic)
Cuevitas and Zapata soils: do not have an argillic horizon.
Delmita soils: are moderately deep to the petrocalcic horizon.
Jimenez and Quemado soils: have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and in addition Jimenez soils have a mollic epipedon.
Sharvana soils: are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than half the time during the growing season and are in a thermic soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: noncalcareous loamy alluvium that has been partially reworked by wind over calcareous loamy residuum and petrocalcics of the Goliad Formation.
Landscape: inland, dissected coastal plains
Landform: summits and shoulders of broad, low ridges.
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Precipitation pattern: The soil is driest during the months of June through August and December through February. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cuevitas, Delmita, and Zapata series.
Cuevitas and Delmita soils: occur on similar positions.
Zapata soils: occur on similar to slightly higher positions, but with steeper surface gradients.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability above a very slowly to slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  Runoff is moderate to high on slopes less than 1 percent and high to very high on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Grass species are plains bristlegrass, Texas bristelgrass, hooded windmillgrass, tanglehead, Wright's threeawn, red grama, hairy tridens, gummy lovegrass, and whorled dropseed. Brush species include leatherstem, guajillo, kindneywood, and range ratany.

REMARKS: Classification change from Petrocalcic Ustic Paleargids to Petrocalcic Paleustalfs based on geographic distribution of the soil, analysis of rainfall patterns, range species composition and production.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 20 to 41 cm (8 to 16 in) (Bt horizon).
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the geographic area.
