ROGERT SERIES

The Rogert series consists of very shallow and shallow , well drained soils formed in thin, noncalcareous, very gravelly or channery materials weathered residually from granite, sandstone, gneiss or in places from tuff.  Rogert soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 3 to about 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rogert very gravelly sandy loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 4 inches; dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) moist; strong fine crumb structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent gravel, mostly fine and very fine angular granite gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 14 inches;  brown (7.5YR 4/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel, mostly fine and very fine angular granite fragments; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 17 inches thick)

    R--14 inches; granite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Colorado; 750 feet south and 900 feet west of the east 1/4 corner of Sec. 8, T. 10 N., R. 78 W.

Mean summer soil temperature:  43 to 58 degrees F
Depth to lithic contact:  8 to 20 inches
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  5 to 20 inches often extends to the lithic contact

COMPETING SERIES:
Arrowpeak (MT), Dollarhide (ID), Labshaft (NV), Milling (WA), Poin (MT)- continuous Bw horizons
Cheadle (MT), Starley (WY) - calcareous in some part above the bedrock
Chokecherry (ID)  Xeric moisture regime

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  derived from thin, noncalcareous, very gravelly or channery materials weathered residually from granite, sandstone, gneiss or in places from tuff 
Landform: mountain slopes and ridges 
Slopes:  3 to 100 percent
Elevation:  7,600 to 10,900 feet
Mean annual temperature:  32 to 43 degrees; southern Colorado 40 to 44 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 25 inches at type location; Utah, 25 to 30 inches at elevations of 9,500 to 11,500 feet, Utah, north mean annual precipitation 12 to 19 inches with elevations of 7,500 to 8,600 feet
Precipitation pattern:  in the mountainous area Colorado:  peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer 
Frost-free period:  20 to 30 days, but ranges to 90 days with elevations down to 7,500 feet; Utah:  50 to 80 days in the north, at elevations of 7,500 to 8,600 feet and mean annual precipitation of 12 to 19 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Juget and Supervisor soils.  Juget soils have mean summer soil temperature warmer than 59 degrees F. and are coarse textured.  Supervisor soils have bedrock at a depth of more than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to very high runoff; moderately rapid to rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for native pastureland. Native vegetation consists of scattered ponderosa pine, Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, fringed sagebrush, slimstem muhly, blue grama, pine dropseed, sagebrush, junegrass, needleandthread, and wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of Colorado and central and northeastern parts of Utah. The series is of moderate extent.
