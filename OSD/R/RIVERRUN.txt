RIVERRUN SERIES 

The Riverrun series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, stream terraces, outwash fans and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Ustifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Riverrun gravelly sandy loam, in native grass (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine and common fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick) 

    C1--10 to 23 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 38 cm thick) 

    C2--23 to 145 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 50 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (75 to 140 cm thick) 

    C3--145 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Jefferson County, Montana; 640 meters north and 350 meters west of the southeast corner of sec. 2, T1N, R4W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature - 4.4 to 7.8 degrees C. 
Depth to a seasonally high water table - 100 to 150 cm for extended periods during portions of the late spring or early summer
Particle-size control section (weighted average) - 35 to 70 percent rock fragments

Note: The surface layer, when mixed to 7 inches does not meet the requirements for a mollic epipedon.  Thin dark colored buried horizons occur in some pedons.
