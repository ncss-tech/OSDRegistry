4/2017--The Rony series was proposed as a result of an update project. The official series description was developed according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation and laboratory sampling of alluvial fans and terraces at the interface of hills and lowlands in MLRA 2 is recommended to determine the distribution and influence of volcanic ash. The Galvin series should be evaluated concurrently to determine if areas mapped in MLRA 2 have an admixture of volcanic glass and could be correlated to the Rony series.
