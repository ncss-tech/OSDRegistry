RUMPAH SERIES

The Rumpah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The Rumpah soils are on old lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Sodic Haplotorrerts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rumpah clay, 0 to 2 percent slopes,  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong very fine and fine granular structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few fine lime and gypsum flecks; violently effervescent; 3 percent gypsum; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bss1--10 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine tubular pores; few intersecting slickensides, few fine lime and gypsum flecks; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    Bss2--22 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine tubular pores; few intersecting slickensides, few fine lime and gypsum flecks; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 12 inches thick)

    Bss3--32 to 54 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine tubular pores; few fine lime flecks; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 30 inches thick)

    2Bk--54 to 74 inches; white (N 8/0) clay, white (10YR 8/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine tubular pores, mostly filled with lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5)

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; in Pahrump Valley about 2375 feet south and 1580 feet west of the northeast corner of section 19 T. 20 S., R. 52 E.; 36 degrees, 11 minutes, 54 seconds north latitude and 116 degrees, 2 minutes, 40 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry,  moist in the winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days during the summer following summer convection storms from July through October.

Soil temperature - 62 to 66 degrees F.

Depth to 2Bk horizon - 40 to 65 inches.



Control section - Clay content:  Averages 45 to 60 percent.

Calcium carbonates equivalent:  20 to 40 percent, mainly disseminated lime.

Other features:  1-to-5 centimeter wide vertical cracks, 8 to 18 inches apart, extending from the surface to a depth of 36 to 50 inches when the soil is dry.

Gilgi feature: Cracks are closed 5 to 30 days in most years.

SAR- 13 to 30 percent.



A horizon - Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma:  2 or 3.

Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard, firm or very firm, sticky or very sticky.

Reaction-  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.



Bw and Bss horizons - Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.

Texture:  Clay or silty clay.

Structure: Prismatic or angular blocky.

Clay content:  45 to 60 percent, weighted average.

Consistence:  Hard or very hard, very firm or extremely firm, sticky or very sticky.

Reaction-  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.



2Bk horizon - Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y or N.

Value:  7 or 8 dry or moist.

Chroma:  0 through 2.

Texture:  Clay or silty clay.

Structure: Prismatic or subangular blocky.

Clay content:  45 to 60 percent weighted average.

Calcium carbonates equivalent-  40 to 60 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rumpah soils are on old lake plains.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources mainly limestone, quartzite and reworked lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 2400 to 2700 feet.  The climate is arid with hot summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches with relatively even monthly distribution with slight peaks in January and August; mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 220 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Besherm and Nopah.  Besherm is carbonatic.  Nopah is fine loamy and carbonatic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly fourwing saltbush and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 30.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Nye County, Nevada, Southwest Part, 1985.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: The classification was changed from Typic Torrerts to Sodic Haplotorrerts in 7/94.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Vertic subgroup features - Cracks in the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 36 inches and slickensides.

Sodic feature - SAR of 13 or more in the control section.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial characterization data S84-NV-023-001.

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 5/1997. ET
