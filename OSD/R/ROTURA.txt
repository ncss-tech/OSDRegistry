ROTURA SERIES 

The Rotura series consists of deep to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium derived from mixed noncalcareous rocks. Rotura soils are on broad basin floors with slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Dona Ana County, New Mexico; SE 1/4, NW 1/4 of section 31, T.23 S, R.1 E., about 700 feet east of road; 106 degrees, 52 minutes, 53 seconds west longitude and 32 degrees, 15 minutes, 53 seconds north latitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July through September and December through April.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Depth to a calcic horizon: 3 to 15 inches

Depth to petrocalcic horizon:  40 to 60 inches

Clay content (particle-size control section):  less than 18 percent

A and AB horizons
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3.5 through 5 moist
Chroma:  2 through 6, dry or moist
Texture:  loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam
Coarse fragments:  less than 5 percent gravel

Bt horizon
Hue:  2.5YR through 10YR
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3.5 through 5 moist; nodules and masses with high calcium carbonate content are 7 through 9 dry, 5 through 7 moist
Chroma:  3 through 6, dry or moist; nodules and masses with high calcium carbonate content have chroma of 2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam, calcium carbonate nodules have sandy clay loam texture in some pedons
Coarse fragments:  less than 5 percent
Other features: The Bt horizon contains some visible calcium carbonate in all subhorizons.  The amount of calcium carbonate or mixing by roots or fauna is enough that orientation of silicate clay on sand grains has been obliterated in some parts of the horizon.  High-calcium carbonate parts of the Bt horizon tend to be harder (hard or very hard) than are low-calcium carbonate parts because of calcium carbonate cementation. 

Bkm horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR (with some included parts of 5YR)
Value:  7 through 9 dry, 6 through 8 moist
Chroma:  1 through 4, dry or moist
Coarse fragments:  less than 20 percent
Other features: The Bkm horizon is indurated throughout, except that it is intermittently interrupted by pipes into which the Bt horizon dips and thus thickens markedly. 

Bk, Bk' and C horizons
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5 through 9 dry, 4 through 8 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, sand and gravelly sand
Coarse fragments:  5 to 30 percent, mainly gravel
Other features: In some pedons, the Bk horizons from 28 to 46 inches contain less calcium carbonate and more reddish, similar to that in the Btk horizons. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rotura soils occur on level or nearly level, very gently undulating basin floors or marginal basin floor positions and have formed in sandy, generally low gravel sediments of mid-Pleistocene age.  In places, such as along the Rio Grande Valley in the vicinity of the type location, streams have trenched the basin floor and the underlying sediments to depths of several hundred feet.  In such situations, valley margins of the basin-floor soils are commonly marked by prominent scarps formed of the thick, high-calcium carbonate horizons of the Rotura soils or their associates.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 3800 to 4500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 to 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 56 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 190 to 220 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bucklebar, Cruces, Hueco, Sonoita and Tencee series.  The Hueco soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Cruces and Tencee soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths within 20 inches of the surface.  The Bucklebar soils are fine-loamy and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  The Sonoita soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability; medium runoff. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists primarily of scattered mesquite, creosotebush and snakeweed; there are many barren areas.  In dune areas, vegetation on dunes is commonly mesquite, with lesser amounts of four-wing saltbush and creosotebush; interdunal areas are commonly barren or contain a few snakeweed. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico.  The series is of small extent.  MLRA is 42.

This series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for the typical pedon, S61(65) NMex-7-8, published on p. 860 and 861 in Gile, L.H. and R.B. Grossman. 1979.  The Desert Project Soil Monograph.  National Technical Information Service.  A summary table of data is also in the Desert Project Guidebook (p. 114).  Data for horizons above the petrocalcic horizon are available for two other Rotura pedons (p. 962-965, Desert Project Soil Monograph).  Further information on the Rotura soils are in Gile (1966a, 1967b) and in Gile, Peterson and Grossman (1966), references cited in the Desert Project Soil Monograph. Additional information for the Rotura soils is in a 1990 Ph.D. thesis by H. Curtis Monger, entitled Soil mineral transformations in a southern New Mexico Aridisol:  pedogenic palygorskite, mineral dissolution and microbial-related calcite.
