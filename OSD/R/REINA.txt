REINA SERIES

The Reina series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to an indurated hardpan.  Reina soils formed in residuum derived from andesite, basalt, quartzite, and tuff with a component of volcanic ash and loess.  Reina soils are on summits and side slopes of bench areas, plateaus, and foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic, shallow Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Reina loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with about 15 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 18 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 18 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--18 to 28 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on peds; 25 percent gravel, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--28 to 46 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; continuous distinct clay films on peds; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    Bkqm--46 to 66 cm; indurated duripan; massive; very hard; very firm; very thin continuous laminar cap; abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 25 cm thick)

    R--66 cm; andesite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; 900 feet north and 1,500 feet east of the southwest corner of section 35, T. 36, N., R. 46 E.; USGS Izzenhood Gap 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 56 minutes 54 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 45 minutes 18 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.9483333 latitude, -116.7550000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in the winter and spring, dry in July through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 36 to 50 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 56 to 76 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 55 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles.

A horizons
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Bt horizons
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR. Value:  4 or 5 dry.
Chroma:  4 or 5.
Texture: Averages very gravelly clay or very gravelly clay loam.

Bkqm horizon
Other features:  Indurated duripan overlying bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Ackett and Trosi series.  

Ackett soils have a calcic horizon above the pan, and in addition have bedrock at depths greater than 100 cm.  Trosi soil lacks indurated bedrock underlying the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reina soils are on summits and side slopes of bench areas, small plateaus, and foothills.  Reina soil formed in residuum derived from andesite, basalt, quartzite, and tuffs with a component of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,525 to 1,830 meters.  The mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. Frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Orovada and Trunk soils.  Orovada soils are very deep and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Trunk soils are moderately deep and have less than 35 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  Reina soils are of small extent. MLRA 24.
