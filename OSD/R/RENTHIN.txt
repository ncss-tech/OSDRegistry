RENTHIN SERIES

The Renthin series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from clayey and silty shale of Permian age. These very gently sloping to gently sloping soils are on convex ridges and side slopes of prairie uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A). Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in).

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated to wheat or other small grains; lesser amounts are in grain sorghum or hybrid forage sorghums. Some old fields have been sprigged to bermudagrass or seeded to old world bluestems and used for hay or tame pasture. Native vegetation consists mostly of tall and mid grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A) of Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Logan County, Oklahoma 1994

REMARKS: This series was formally included in the Renfrow, Vernon, and Zaneis series in earlier surveys. The name Renthin was coined from the Renfrow series and the word thin, since this series differs only in solum thickness from the Renfrow series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in) (A, BA, and Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 25 to 140 cm (10 to 55 in) (Bt horizons) 
Accumulation of calcium carbonate: 74 to 140 cm (29 to 55 in) (Bk horizons) 
Ustolls: soil moisture control section dry in some part more than 90 days
Udertic: Cracks within 125 cm (49 in) of the mineral soil surface that are 5 mm or more wide through a thickness of 30 mm (1 in) or more for some time in most years, and slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates in a layer 15 cm (6 in) or more thick that has its upper boundary within 125 cm (49 in) of the mineral soil surface, or a linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between the mineral soil surface and either a depth of 100 cm (39 in) or a paralithic contact, whichever is shallower.
Cr horizon: the paralithic rock-like material at a depth of 140 cm (55 in)
