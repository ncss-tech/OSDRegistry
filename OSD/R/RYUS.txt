RYUS SERIES

The Ryus series consists of deep well drained upland soils.  They formed in loess that has been altered slightly by flooding.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 46 centimeters (18 inches), and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ryus silty clay loam in a cultivated area.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) thick)

   BA--15 to 33 centimeters (6 to 13 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (13 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) thick)

   Bt--33 to 66 centimeters (13 to 26 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (25 to 38 centimeters (10 to 15 inches) thick)

   BC--66 to 91 centimeters (26 to 36 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (15 to 36 centimeters (15 to 36 centimeters (6 to 14 inches) thick)

   C--91 to 152 centimeters (36 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; segregated lime in thin seams; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Grant County, Kansas; about 13 kilometers (8 miles) north and 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) west of Ulysses; 91 meters (300 feet) north and 61 meters (200 feet) west of the southeast corner of sec. 17, T. 27 S., R 37 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Thickness of the solum: 71 to 102 centimeters (28 to 40 inches)
Typically free carbonates: throughout, in some pedons the upper 15 centimeters (6 inches) is noncalcareous
Mollic epipedon: 25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silty clay loam or silty clay 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline
Clay content: 35 to 42 

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 6 to 8, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silty clay loam or silt loam
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bethune, Blackpipe, Boneek, Boquillas, Chapin, Collbran, Collide, Emigrant, Huggins, Kube, Leyden, Loma, Nuncho, Nunn, Querc, Rednun, Richfield, Savo, Showlow, Standley, Thunderbird, Weld and Wormser series.  
Bethune, Blackpipe, Boquillas, Chapin, Emigrant, Huggins, Kube, Leyden, Querc, Thunderbird and Wormser soils are moderately deep over bedrock.  
Boquillas, Showlow, and Standley series contain more sand and gravel throughout the pedon.  
Blackpipe, Boneek, Chapin, Collbran, Emigrant, Nunn, Rednun, Richfield, Savo, Wormser series are noncalcareous to depths of more than 25 centimeters (10 inches.  
Collbran, Collide, Loma and Rednun soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Nuncho soils are on outwash terraces, alluvial fans, fan aprons, fan remnants, ridges and hills.
Standley soils have gravelly Bt horizons. 
Weld soils have calcareous material at 20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: nearly level to slightly depressional uplands 
Flooding: occasionally by streams diverted from filled valleys
Parent material: loess that has been altered slightly by flooding
Flooding and consequent recharge of carbonates: presumed to have begun subsequent to the development of an argillic horizon
Mean annual precipitation: 38 to 48 centimeters (15 to 19 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 14 degrees C. (50 to 57 degrees F.)  
Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 24 to 32.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bridgeport, Goshen and Ulysses series.
Ulysses soils are on adjacent uplands.
Goshen soils along swales in the uplands
Bridgeport soils on terraces.  
Bridgeport, Goshen, and Ulysses soils are fine silty.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high  
Flooding: occasional 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all areas are cultivated.  
Wheat is the usual dryland crop. 
Native vegetation is short and mid grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Kansas.  The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Grant County, Kansas, 1965.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 33 centimeters (0 to 13 inches) (AP, BA horizons)
Argillic horizon: 33 to 66 centimeters (13 to 26 inches) (Bt horizon)

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
