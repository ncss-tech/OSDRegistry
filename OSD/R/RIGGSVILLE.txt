RIGGSVILLE SERIES

The Riggsville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. Riggsville soils are on moraines, drumlins, lake terraces and till plains. They formed in sandy deposits and the underlying loamy till. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Alfic Epiaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Riggsville loamy sand, on a northeast-facing, 2 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of 262 meters (860 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[10 to 33 cm (4 to 13 inches) thick]

[10 to 28 cm (4 to 11 inches) thick]

 2Cd--76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam; moderate very thick platy fragments; very firm; common prominent light gray (5Y 7/1) carbonate coatings throughout; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; 4 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lablatz series. Lablatz soils do not have a densic contact within a depth of 127 cm (50 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Riggsville soils are on moraines, drumlins, lake terraces, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in sandy deposits and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 838 mm (28 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are the Au Gres, Brevort, Cheboygan and Otisco soils. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and Otisco soils are formed in adjacent sandy sediments. The very poorly drained or poorly drained Brevort soils are in depressional areas and lower landscape positions. The well drained or moderately well drained Cheboygan soils are on higher positions in the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the upper sandy material and low in the lower loamy horizons. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper sandy material and very slow in the lower loamy horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Riggsville soils are in woodland. Forest vegetation consists mainly of sugar maple, red maple, American basswood and American beech; many areas have quaking aspen, white birch and balsam fir. Selected acreage is used for pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in Lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
