MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kent County, Delaware 2006 

REMARKS: Reybold soils were previously mapped as inclusions in the Matapeake and Sassafras series. Base saturation at the critical depth for taxonomic placement exceeds 35 percent (sum of cations). The high base status is thought to be due to extensive liming practices and not inherent of parent material weathering. 
Diagnostic horizons and characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 cm (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 76 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity--Abrupt textural contact at 76 cm (2BC horizon) 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization data is available from the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE: pedon S95DE003-004.
