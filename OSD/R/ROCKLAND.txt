ROCKLAND SERIES

The Rockland series consists of well drained soils formed in loamy colluvium from rotational landslides on slopes of stream valleys and dissections of ground moraines.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the upper part of the profile and moderately slow in the lower part.  Slopes range from 18 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Typic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rockland silt loam, on a 63 percent slope on a river valley at an elevation of 245 meters.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oi--0 to 2 centimeters; slightly decomposed plant material; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--2 to 13 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam; brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; friable; many very fine to coarse roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 centimeters thick)

(30 to 51 centimeters thick)

 C1--58 to 130 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt loam; weak thick platy structure; friable; few very fine to medium roots; few distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay films on ped faces; few distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt coats on faces of peds; few thin lenses of fine sandy loam throughout; about 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (64 to 76 centimeters thick)

 C2--130 to 178 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; few distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay films on surfaces along root channels; few distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt coats on faces of peds; few thin lenses of fine sandy loam throughout; few medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; about 5 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (46 to 61 centimeters thick)

 C3--178 to 203 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt loam; massive; friable; thin layer of buried twigs, bark, leaves and moss at upper boundary of horizon; few thin lenses of fine sandy loam throughout; common coarse distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; about 5 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same taxonomic family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material - colluvium derived from loamy till
Landform - ravines in dissected ground moraines and stream valleys
Geomorphic component - side slopes
Slope - 18 to 70 percent
Mean annual precipitation  - 790 to 860 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Algonquin, Big Iron, Flintsteel, Mongo, Negwegon, and Watton soils.
Algonquin - are on lake plains on slopes of 0 to 6 percent, are in the fine particle-size class, and Aquic Hapludalfs Subgroup.
Big Iron - are on higher ground moraines on slopes of 0 to 8 percent, and are in the Aquic Glossudalfs Subgroup.
Flintsteel - are on higher ground moraines, have slopes of 1 to 30 percent, and are in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs Subgroup.
Mongo - are on lake plains on slopes of 12 to 45 percent, are in the fine particle-size class, and Haplic Glossudalfs Subgroup.
Negwegon  are on lake plains on slopes of 2 to 12 percent, and are in the fine particle-size class, and Oxyaquic Glossudalfs Subgroup.
Watton - and are on higher ground and end moraines, and in the Haplic Glossudalfs Subgroup.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage  water saturation does not occur above a depth of 203 centimeters year round (well drained).  Additionally, a dry layer occurs from 30 to 46 centimeters deep in July and August.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (O, A, and B horizons) - moderate
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (C horizon) - moderately slow

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested.  The major species are sugar maple, white pine, green ash, quaking aspen, eastern hemlock, yellow birch, white birch, ironwood, northern white cedar and balsam fir.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Major Land Resource Area 92  Superior Lake Plain; Ontonagon  County Michigan Subset, January 2007. Proposed in Ontonagon County, Michigan, 2001. The source of the name is the village of Rockland in Ontonagon, County.

REMARKS:  Classification changed from Dystric Eutrudepts on the field review notes to Typic Eutrudepts due to carbonates in the profile.

Diagnostic horizons in the type location include:
Ochric epipedon - 2 to 13 centimeters (A horizon) 
Cambic horizon - 13 to 58 centimeters (Bw horizon)

Some pedons have buried leaves, twigs and moss.  Mass soil movement has left random remnants of soil structure from prior upslope soil development and has buried tree branches, leaves and moss.
