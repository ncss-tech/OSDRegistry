RALPHSTON SERIES

The Ralphston series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and other volcanic materials on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches; and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ralphston loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine, very fine and few medium roots; common fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--2 to 7 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common medium, few very fine and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw2--7 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, very fine and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    C1--13 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, very fine, and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--20 to 25 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, very fine, and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    2C3--25 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Catron County, New Mexico; northwest 1/4, southwest 1/4, southwest 1/4, sec. 3, T. 1 N., R. 17 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section July through September and December through April. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  49 to 56 degrees F.

Depth to stratified ash deposits:  20 to 30 inches

Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent cinders

Particle-size control section:  18 to 35 percent clay, more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser

A horizon
Value - 3 or 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3
Texture:  sandy loam or loam

B horizon
Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 2 to 5 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  loam or sandy clay loam

C horizon
Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  6 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Connerton (WY), Nucla (CO), and Tarryall (CO) series.  The Connerton soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Tarryall soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Nucla soils have less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ralphston soils are on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and other volcanic materials.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches; the average annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 115 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Amenson, Albinas, and Flugle.  Amenson soils have a petrocalcic horizon.  Albinas soils have a thick mollic epipedon.  Flugle soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium.  Moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Ralphston soils are primarily used for grazing.  Present vegetation is pinyon, juniper, blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ralphston soils are moderately extensive in west-central New Mexico. MLRA 35.
