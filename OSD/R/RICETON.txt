RICETON SERIES

The Riceton series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in mixed alluvium predominantly from acid igneous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent in valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Riceton coarse sandy loam -- on a gently sloping north-facing alluvial fan in nonirrigated grain cropland. When described on October 30, 1974, the soil was moist to 8 inches. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Ap--0 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 10 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

	A--10 to 21 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 10 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick)

	Bw1--21 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 25 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

	Bw2--28 to 46 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; 25 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 20 inches thick)

	C1--46 to 54 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; 30 percent fine gravel;  neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 26 inches thick)

	C2--54 to 70 inches; light color stratified sand and gravel, dominantly granitic; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic.

TYPE LOCATION: Camas County, Idaho; about 4.5 miles west and 1 mile south of Corral; 100 feet west and 500 feet south of the northeast corner of the NW 1/4 of section 21, T.1 S., R.12 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Moonstone and Northfork (T) series. Moonstone soils have weathered bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Northfork soils have O horizons, are dry 45 to 75 consecutive days and do not have stratified sand and gravel alluvium in the lower part.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Riceton soils are on level to moderately sloping alluvial fans and stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 12 percent. Elevations range from 4,800 to 5,500 feet. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches including 2 to 5 feet of snow. Average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brinegar, Simonton, and Vodermaier soils. Brinegar and Simonton soils have a moderately fine textured argillic horizon. Brinegar soils are also moderately well drained. Vodermaier soils do not have a pachic epipedon and have sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches. These soils are all on geomorphic positions similar to Riceton soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Riceton soils are used primarily for irrigated or nonirrigated cropland. Some areas are used for pasture/hayland or rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Idaho. MLRA 10A. Riceton soils are not extensive.
