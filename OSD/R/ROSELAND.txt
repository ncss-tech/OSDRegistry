ROSELAND SERIES

The Roseland series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in loamy residuum from acid shale.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, thermic Humic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Roseland silt loam - on a 7 percent north-facing slope in pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 8 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) crushed; strong fine granular structure; friable; common fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

   BA--8 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

   Bw--12 to 18 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very shaly silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very firm; 60 percent shale fragments, very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

   C1--18 to 25 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very shaly silty clay loam; massive; firm; 60 percent shale fragments; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick)

   C2--25 to 56 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very shaly silty clay loam; massive; firm; 60 percent shale fragments; strongly acid.  (0 to 30 inches thick)

   Cr--56 inches; soft shale bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Henry County, Missouri; about 2 miles northeast of Urich; 1020 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 24, T. 43 N., R.  28 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft shale bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The upper part of the solum has 0 to 30 percent shale fragments and the lower part has 35 to 80 percent.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam or their shaly analogues.

The BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam or their shaly analogues.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very shaly or extremely shaly analogues of silty clay loam or clay loam.

The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has texture similar to the Bw horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Competing series in other families are the Barco and Bolivar soils which have an argillic horizon and are moderately deep to soft sandstone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roseland soils are on convex ridgetops and side slopes of the uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in loamy residuum from acid shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 60 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 42 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Barco and the Deepwater and Hartwell soils.  Barco soils commonly are higher on the slope.  Deepwater and Hartwell soils have thicker sola and argillic horizons.  Deepwater soils commonly are higher on the slope, but may be in similar positions.  Hartwell soils are on nearly level and gently sloping positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium or rapid.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for pasture, hayland, or cultivated crops.  Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses and woody shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Missouri.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Henry County, Missouri, 1972.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 12 inches (A and BA horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 18 inches (Bw horizon); paralithic contact - 56 inches; udic moisture regime.
