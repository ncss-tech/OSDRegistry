RIVERWAY SERIES

The Riverway series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium.  These level soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Riverway sandy clay loam--cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

       Ap--0 to 43 centimeters (0.0 to 16.9 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/3) crushed sandy clay loam, brown(7.5YR 4/3) crushed, moist; 53 percent sand; 24 percent silt; 23 percent clay; strong coarse cloddy structure; noncemented, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderate excavation difficulty; electrical conductivity of 1.6 mmhos/cm by ECe meter, 1:1 water; slight effervescence, by HCl, 1 normal; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2, pH meter 1:1 water; clear smooth boundary. Lab sample # D7356. (15 to 30 inches thick)

       C1--43 to 102 centimeters (16.9 to 40.2 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/3) crushed sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) crushed, moist; 55 percent sand; 21 percent silt; 24 percent clay; massive; noncemented, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderate excavation difficulty; electrical conductivity of 2.4mmhos/cm by ECe meter, 1:1 water; strong effervescence, by HCl, 1 normal; moderately alkaline, pH8.0, pH meter 1:1 water; abrupt smooth boundary. Lab sample # D7357.

       C2--102 to 203 centimeters (40.2 to 79.9 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) crushed stratified fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) crushed, moist; 76 percent sand; 10 percent silt; 14 percent clay; massive; noncemented, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderate excavation difficulty; electrical conductivity of 0.8 mmhos/cm by ECe meter, 1:1 water; noneffervescent, by HCl, 1 normal; moderately alkaline, pH 8.3, pH meter 1:1 water; common thin (.5 to 2 inch thick) pink (7.5YR 7/3) crushed strata of very fine sandy loam and fine sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) crushed, moist.

TYPE LOCATION: El Paso County, Texas; from the junction of Interstate 10 and Highway 1281 at the Horizon exit, 1.7 miles west on Highway 1281; 0.56 miles south on North Loop Road; 0.42 miles east on field road to Mesa Drain; 0.27 miles south along Mesa Drain; 212 feet east in field.  Ysleta USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle.  Latitude 31 degrees 38 minutes 37.68 seconds north and longitude 106 degrees 15 minutes 0.64 seconds west.  UTM zone 13, 381453E, 3501447N; NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts more than three-fourths of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 63 to 67 degrees F.


Particle-size control section (weighted average):

Clay content:  20 to 35 percent

Sand content: greater than 50 percent
 
Ap horizon:
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to less than 1 percent

C horizon: 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist 
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam, with few to many thin strata of fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam
Clay content: 8 to 35 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to less than 1 percent
Stratification:  Usually .5 to 3 inches thick consisting of finer or coarser material.   Some strata may range to 6 inches thick.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Leeds (UT), Lerdo (CA), Rosamond (CA) series.
The Leeds soils have hue of 5YR or redder and contain 5 to 20 percent in the C horizon and contain 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.
Lerdo soils average less than 50 percent sand in the particle size control section, annual precipitation is 5 or 6 inches and ESP ranges from 1 to more than 70 but averages 30.
Rosamond soils average less than 50 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Precipitation zone is 3 to 6 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: fine-loamy mixed alluvium deposited by water
Landform: flood plain, protected by large dams.
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The driest months are March and April. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 200 to 240 days
Elevation: 3,600 to 3,800 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alcazar, Fabens, Isla, Lantana, Tigua, and Ysleta soils. 
Alcazar soils are coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on similar positions.
