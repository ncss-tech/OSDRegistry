RIO KING SERIES

The Rio King series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess and volcanic ash.  The Rio King soils are on stream terraces and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Bw horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3
Structure: Subangular blocky or is massive.
Consistence: Slightly hard or hard, dry, very friable or friable, moist: nonsticky or slightly sticky wet.

Other features:  Thin layers, less than 15 cm thick, with weak silica cementation are in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burch, Calpine, Cashmere, Cashmont, Roloff, Roosevelt, Snake Hollow and Surpass series.  Burch, Calpine, Cashmere, Cashmont, Roloff, Roosevelt, and Surpass series are well drained.  In addition, Burch and Cashmere soils have Bw horizons.  Calpine soils have weakly expressed Bt horizons.  Cashmont and Surprise soils have gravelly control sections.  Roloff and Roosevelt soils are moderately deep over bedrock.  Snake Hollow soils have Bw horizons and more than half the sand fraction is very coarse sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rio King soils are on inset fans and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks, loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations are 1,200 to 1,700 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kingsriver and Valmy series.  Kingsriver soils have aquic moisture regimes and mollic epipedons that are cumulic.  Valmy soils lack mollic epipedons and have duric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately Well drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  (Seasonal water table is 150 to 180 cm in the spring.)

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated hayland, cropland, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is irrigated alfalfa.  Uncultivated areas are mainly basin big sagebrush and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  MLRA 24.  Rio King soils are not extensive.
