REDCREST SERIES

The Redcrest series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from siltstone and fine-grained sandstone.  Redcrest soils are on mountains and slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 milimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redcrest soils are on slightly convex to linear mountain slopes.. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 60 to 640 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rootcreek (TCA), Salmoncreek (TCA), and Scoutcamp (TCA) soils. Rootcreek soils have redoximorphic features between 50 and 100 centimeters from the soil surface. Salmoncreek soils have redoximorphic features between 10 to and 25 centimeters from the soil surface. Scoutcamp soils have less than 15 percent paragravel in the particle size control section.  Rootcreek soils are on linear to concave positions and in drainageways.  Salmoncreek soils are on linear to concave positions on broad summits and backslopes, ridges, and mountain slopes. Scoutcamp soils are on linear and to slightly concave to or convex backslope positions on mountain slopes.   

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, high runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for commercial timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Natural vegetation includes coast redwood, Douglas-fir, tanoak, California hazel, California huckleberry, salal, western swordfern, Douglas iris, and thimbleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is moderately extensive.
