RAHWORTH SERIES

The Rahworth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rosebud County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0586.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (E, Bw1, Bw2 horizons); a cambic horizon from 2 to 11 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2, Bk, Byz, Bz horizons); a BC horizon that is moist when not frozen.  Rahworth soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

Classification was changed from Borollic Camborthids to Aridic Ustochrepts in 1993.
