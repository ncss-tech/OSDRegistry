ROANHIDE SERIES



The Roanhide series consists of moderately deep over bedrock, well

drained soils on hills and mountains.  They formed in material from

intermediate intrusive rocks.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about

14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Haploxerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Roanhide coarse sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are

for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, very

dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine

granular structure; soft, very friable; many very fine and few medium

roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear

smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)



    A2--4 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, very

dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine and fine roots;

many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (4

to 6 inches thick)



    Bw--9 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) coarse sandy loam, dark brown

(10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; many fine and very fine

roots; many fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth

boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)



    C1--15 to 22 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) coarse sandy

loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very

friable; slightly sticky; few fine and very fine roots; few fine

tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 16

inches thick)



    Cr--22 to 24 inches; slightly weathered, fractured granitic

bedrock; few roots in cracks.  (1 to 3 inches thick)



    R--24 inches; bedrock.



TYPE LOCATION:  Camas County, Idaho; about 7 miles north and one mile

and a quarter east of Hill City, Idaho; 2,000 feet east and 1,200 feet

south of the NW corner of section 27, T.1N., R.12E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F

Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches

Reaction - slightly acid or neutral throughout

Base saturation - 50 to 75 percent in some part above 30 inches



A horizon

Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Chroma - 1 or 2



Bw horizon

Value - 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist

Chroma - 2 through 4

Texture - COSL, SL, GR-COSL, GR-SL



C horizon

Value - 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma - 2 or 3

Texture - COSL, SL, GR-COSL, GR-SL, ST-COSL, ST-SL



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baldmountain and Kilmerque series.

Kilmerque soils have an O horizon and lack hard bedrock above depth of

40 inches.  Baldmountain soils are greater than 40 inches deep.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roanhide soils are on hills or mountains and have

slopes of 4 to 60 percent.  They formed in material wathered from

granite, quartz monzonite, and other intrusive igneous rocks.

Elevations are 4,000 to 6,800 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 12

to 20 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees

F.  Frost-free period is 60 to 100 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bauscher, Earcree, and

Lockman soils.  Bauscher soils have a B2t horizon.  Earcree and Lockman

soils have a summer temperature colder than 60 degrees F.  Earcree and

Lockman soils are on north-facing slopes.  Bauscher soils are on

toeslopes or north-facing slopes at lower elevations.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff;

moderately rapid permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland or pasture.  Vegetation in the

potential natural plant community is bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber

needlegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue,

and bitterbrush.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  The series is

moderately extensive.
