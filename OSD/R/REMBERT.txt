RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

A or Ap horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam 

E horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam 

Btg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Some pedons have a thin subhorizon of sandy clay loam in the upper part.
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)-few to many iron masses in shade of red, yellow, or brown in most pedons

BCg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay, or it is stratified with these textures and with strata of coarser material 
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)-few to many iron masses in shade of red, yellow, or brown in most pedons

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 2

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sumter County, South Carolina; l969.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Grady series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 5 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 33 inches (Btg horizon)
Aquults feature - dominant chroma of 1 in the matrix of the argillic horizon and masses of iron accumulation
Endosaturation - saturation (shown by a dominant chroma of 1 or less) in all layers to a depth of 80 inches
