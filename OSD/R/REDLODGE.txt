REDLODGE SERIES

The Redlodge series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. They are in drainageways and closed depressions. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Cumulic Cryaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Redlodge clay - meadow grasses. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A1--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium and fine blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and many very fine roots; few fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick) 

    A2--2 to 10 inches; very dark gray (N 3/0) clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine blocky; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual boundary. (8 to 10 inches thick) 

    A3--10 to 16 inches; very dark gray (N 3/0) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) with black (10YR 2/1) coatings, moist; moderate medium and fine blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots and pores; prominent organic stained film on peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick) 

    ACg--16 to 25 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) and gray (N 6/0) clay, dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) and gray (N 5/0) moist; strong medium and fine blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 12 inches thick) 

    Ckg--25 to 36 inches; gray (N 6/0) mottled with olive yellow (5Y 6/6), gray, yellow, brown and olive clay, gray (5Y 5/1) mottled with gray (5Y 6/1), olive (5Y 4/4) and very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and plastic; many fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 30 inches thick) 

    Abg1--36 to 42 inches; dark gray (N 4/0) mottled with olive yellow (5Y 6/6) clay, dark gray (N 4/0) mottled with olive (5Y 4/4), very dark gray (N 3/0) and gray (N 5/0) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick) 

    Abg2--42 to 60 inches; gray (2.5Y 6/1) and olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) clay, gray (5Y 5/1) mottled with olive (5Y 4/4), gray (5Y 6/1), dark gray (5Y 4/1) and very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; strongly effervescent; common fine masses of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - drainageways and closed depressions.

Elevation - 4,000 to 7,500 feet.

Slope - 0 to 15 percent

Parent material - alluvium.

Climate - long cold winters, cool moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 30 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 34 to 43 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adel and Bearmouth series.  Adel series are pachic and are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, drainageways and swales.  Bearmouth soils are sandy-skeletal and are on flood plains, stream terraces and fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Meadow of wild hay, timothy, bluegrass, clover and brome. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Redlodge series is inextensive but is widely distributed in narrow stream valleys in southwestern and south-central Montana. MLRA 44.
