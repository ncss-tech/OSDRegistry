COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ames, Leaksville, Pierron, Watchung, Wynoose, and Zwingle series. Ames and Wynoose soils average more than 5 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Leaksville soils formed in residuumweathered from Triassic dhale rocks. Pierron soils have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 13.3 degrees C (56 degrees F). Watchung soils formed in residuum and are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Zwingle soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rushville soils are on nearly level summits or depressions on till plains. Slope gradients typically are less than 1 percent, and range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in more than 152 cm (60 inches) of loess. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 dwgrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1143 mm (29 to 45 inches), frost free days ranges from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 311 meters (340 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clarksdale, Clinton, Keomah, and Marine soils. The somewhat poorly drained Marine, Clarksdale, and Keomah soils are on slightly higher and slightly more convex parts of the summits. The moderately well drained Clinton soils are dominantly browner in the lower one-half of the series control section, do not have abrupt textural change in the upper lower one-third of the control section, and are on the crests and side slopes of summits above Rushville soils or on side slopes of drainageways below them. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. The potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately low (0.02 to 0.42 micrometers per second).  Permeability is very slow. The seasonal high water table is above the surface to 46 cm (1.5 feet) below the surface in spring in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow are the principal crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central Illinois and southeastern Iowa in MLRA 108A, 108B, 108C, 109, 114B, 115B, and 115C. Rushville soils are of small extent; about 7,500 acres have been correlated to date.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon - the zone from the surfaces of the soil to a depth of approximately 33 cm (13 inches) (Ap and Eg horizons);
albic horizon - the zone from approximately 18 to 33 cm (7 to 13 inches) (Eg horizon);
abrupt textural change feature - from the E horizon to the Btg1 horizon;
argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 33 to 127 cm (13 to 50 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 and Btg5 horizons);
aquic moisture regime. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Engineering test data for the typical pedon are published in the Soil Survey of Adams County, Illinois. University of Illinois soils lab data for 10 pedons are on file at the state office. 

In Iowa, the native vegetative cover is a mixed herbaceous and woody community commonly inhabited with Green Ashes, American Elms, Common Hackberries, Eastern Cottonwoods, American Sycamores, Silky Dogwoods, Black Willows, Wild Black Currants, Riverbank Grapes, Grays Sedges, Hop Sedges, Virginia Wildryes, Stiff Bedstraws, White Avens, Wood Nettles, False Nettles, Canadian Clearweeds, and Common Bonesets.
