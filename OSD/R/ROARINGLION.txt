ROARINGLION SERIES

The Roaringlion series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash over fine tertiary sediments.  These soils are on outwash fans, fan remnants and eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Roaringlion loam, in rangeland on a 10 percent slope at 1,103 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 30 cm thick)

    2Bt1--25 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure; firm, hard, moderately sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; common faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist clay films on ped faces and along pore linings; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary. 

    2Bt2--33 to 43 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; very firm, very hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; common distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist clay films on ped faces; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons - 22 to 64 cm) 

    2C1--43 to 56 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; firm, very hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary.

    2C2--56 to 79 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; firm, hard, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few very fine irregular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of 2C1 and 2C2 horizons - 20 to 76 cm)

    2C3--79 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular and interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).
