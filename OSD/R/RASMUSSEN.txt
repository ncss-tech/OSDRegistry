RASMUSSEN SERIES

The Rasmussen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess or loess influenced slope alluvium from basalt. Rasmussen soils are on valley floors and hills. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 650 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Rasmussen silt loam, on a northwest facing, 4 percent slope in sagebrush at an elevation of 1,988 meters. When described on October 27, 2015, the soil was moist in the upper part and dry in the lower part. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and medium, and common fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

 A2--10 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, and common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt1--25 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--36 to 76 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine, fine, and medium tubular and irregular pores; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent silt coats on all faces of peds; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt3--76 to 113 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine, fine, and medium tubular and irregular pores; 30 percent distinct clay films on surfaces along pores and on all faces of peds; 80 percent silt coats on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt4--113 to 138 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium prismatic; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent prominent clay films on surfaces along pores and on all faces of peds; 65 percent silt coats on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt5--138 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium tubular pores; 60 percent prominent clay films on surfaces along pores and on all faces of peds; 3 percent silt coats on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Caribou County, Idaho, Caribou County Area, Idaho Soil Survey, 2017. The name Rasmussen is from a nearby valley.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (A1, A2, Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 25 to greater than 150 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5 horizons)
Particle-size control section: 25 to 75 cm (Bt1, part of Bt2 horizons).

Rasmussen soils have a cryic temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime bordering on udic.
