REESE SERIES

The Reese series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash and volcanic rocks.  Reese soils are on alluvial flats and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; about 3.7 miles south of Battle Mountain on the flood plain of the Reese River; about 2,000 feet west of the approximate southeast corner of section 5, T. 31 N., R. 45 E.; USGS Blossom Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 34 minutes 49 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 55 minutes 36 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.5802778 latitude, -116.9266667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; Saturated at depths of 30 to 90 cm between March and July; xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to horizons with firm consistence and a brittle manner of failure: 38 to 76 cm.
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline (up to pH 9.6).
Sodicity (SAR): 13 to 500 in the upper 50 cm and decreases with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 30 percent. Sand content: More than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. 
Rock fragments:  Up to 5 percent gravel below 64 cm in many pedons.

A horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 4, dry or moist.

C, Cq, and Cqk horizons
Hue:  10YR through 5Y.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture:  Stratified loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam; Some pedons have thin strata of coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.
Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard, dry, very friable to firm, moist and slightly sticky to very sticky wet.  A brittle manner of failure may exist in the matrix when moist consistence is firm or very firm.
Secondary silica and durinodes:  Cq horizons are brittle in the matrix with subhorizons containing 20 to 50 percent durinodes.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Charnock series.  Charnock soils do not have a horizon that has a matrix with firm consistence when moist and a brittle manner of failure.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reese soils are on alluvial flats and flood plains.   These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash and volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Batan, Bubus, Duffer, Sombrero, and Sonoma soils.  Batan soils are fine-silty and have durinodes in a friable matrix.  Bubus soils are coarse-loamy and have durinodes in a friable matrix.  Duffer soils are fine-silty and have calcic horizons.  Sombrero soils are shallow to duripans.  Sonoma soils are fine-silty and have buried A horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) year-round and ranges up to depths of 30 to 90 cm for brief periods during the spring runoff period between March and July.  Cumulative annual duration class for deep endosaturation is Persistent.  Flooding is none, rare or occasional.  Some phases are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration year-round with water up to 30 cm deep.  A drained phase is recognized.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Reese soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, alkali sacaton, alkali bluegrass, basin wildrye, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada and south-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 24, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lander County (North Part), Nevada, 1974.

REMARKS:  The revision of July 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Halaquepts.  Future study is needed to determine the amount of volcanic glass in this series and whether the taxonomic class should be changed to Ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Aquandic Halaquepts.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and part of the A2 horizons).
Durinodes - The zones from 48 to 69 cm and 124 to 152 cm (Cq and Cqk2 horizons).
Duric feature - The zone from 69 to 100 cm (Cqk1 horizon).
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 46 and 90 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the C, Cq, and Cqk1 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cq horizon and parts of the C and Cqk1 horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon from Lake County, Oregon is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S86OR-037-005 (pedon # 86P0991).  Selected data are available.
