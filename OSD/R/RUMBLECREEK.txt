RUMBLECREEK SERIES

The Rumblecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till and drift.  These soils are on moraines, till plains, hills, escarpments and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rumblecreek gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    E2--10 to 22 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt/E--22 to 34 inches; B part (60 percent) is yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; E part (40 percent) light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist that tongues into the B part; texture mixed is very gravelly clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; common faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.
