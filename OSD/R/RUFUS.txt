RUFUS SERIES

The Rufus series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metasedimentary bedrock, and modified by till, volcanic ash and/or loess. These soils are mostly on glaciated hillsides, mountainsides and ridgetops. Slopes are 8 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 610 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Lithic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Rufus channery ashy loam - woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak, fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 30 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

(8 to 20 cm thick)

    AC--20 to 35 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely flaggy ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent channers and 40 percent flagstones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    2R--35 cm; phyllite bedrock.

Oakside (CA): do not have volcanic glass in the surface and have a mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 15 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rufus soils are on glaciated hillsides, mountainsides, and ridgetops at elevations of 485 to 1,480 meters. Aspect is usually south-facing. Slopes are convex or complex and range from 8 to 65 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metasedimentary bedrock, and modified by till, volcanic ash and/or loess.  These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 375 to 760 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7.0 to 11.0 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aits, Dehart, Huckleberry, Maki, Oxerine, Raisio, Scoap, and Stevens soils. Aits, Dehart, Scoap, and Stevens soils are more than 150 cm deep. Aits soils are on glaciated mountains. Dehart soils are on mountains. Scoap soils are frigid and are on uplands and mountainsides. Huckleberry soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal, are cryic and are on mountains. Maki, Oxerine, and Raisio soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact. Maki soils are on south facing glaciated uplands and mountainsides. Stevens soils are coarse-loamy and are on south facing hillsides, rounded hilltops, mountainsides and ridgetops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Native vegetation is widely spaced ponderosa pine and scattered Douglas-fir with an understory of Saskatoon serviceberry, ceanothus, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, pinegrass, prairie junegrass, arrowleaf balsamroot, lupine, eriogonum, phlox and stonecrop.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. Series is moderately extensive. MLRA 43A, 6.
