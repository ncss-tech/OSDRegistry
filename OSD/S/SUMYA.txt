SUMYA SERIES

The Sumya series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and breccias.  Sumya soils are on side slopes of mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, nonacid, frigid Lithic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Sumya very cobbly clay loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 3 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    C--10 to 23 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam,  brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, few fine through coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 thick)

    2R--23 cm; andesite.

TYPE LOCATION: Pershing County, Nevada; approximately 51 miles southeast of Winnemucca on the east slope of the Tobin Range, about 2,200 feet north and 2,000 feet east of the projected southwest corner of section 3, T. 27 N., R. 39 E.; latitude 40 degrees 14 minutes 11 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 34 minutes 48 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry from July through October; aridic soil moisture regimebordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 18 to 30 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.
Other features: The profile is noncalcareous throughout.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value: 3 or 4 moist.

C horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture: Very gravelly clay or very gravelly clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sumya soils are on side slopes of mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite flows and breccias.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,585 to 2,290 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pernty, Reluctan and Roca soils. Pernty soils have loamy-skeletal control sections. Reluctan and Roca soils are greater than 50 cm deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; rapid or very rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Utah juniper, mountain big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central, Nevada. These soils are of small extent.  MLRA 24, 27.
