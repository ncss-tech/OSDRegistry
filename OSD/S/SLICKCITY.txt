SLICKCITY SERIES

The Slickcity series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine-loamy alluvium over coarse gypseous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on alluvial flats on basin floors. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing soil series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Slickcity soils are on alluvial flats and basin floors. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed from fine-loamy alluvium over coarse gypseous lacustrine deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,950 to 4,490 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aerobee, Shot, Yesum, and Prelo soil series.  Aerobee soils are on interdunes and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Shot soils are on dunes and have a sandy particle-size control section. Yesum soils are coarse-loamy and have gypsic horizons within 7 inches from the surface (Leptic). Prelo soils occur in drainageways and have a fine-silty particle control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, and Torrey's jointfir. The ecological site is Gyp Upland (R042XB006NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin and surrounding piedmonts. MLRA 42, Slickcity is of limited extent.
