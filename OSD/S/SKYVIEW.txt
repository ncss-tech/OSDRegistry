SKYVIEW SERIES 

The Skyview series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Skyview very cobbly sandy loam, very bouldery, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 5 cm; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. (3 to 8 cm thick) 

    A--5 to 15 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) very cobbly sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 35 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 13 cm thick) 

    E--15 to 45 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very cobbly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 36 cm thick) 

    Bt/E--45 to 68 cm; Bt part (75 percent) brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; E part (25 percent) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; Bt part, many faint clay films bridging sand grains; 10 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (23 to 36 cm thick) 

   Cr--68 to 78 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly coarse sand; neutral (pH 6.9). (10 to 41 cm thick) 

   R--78 cm; hard granite bedrock.
