SKYVIEW SERIES 

The Skyview series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

(8 to 14 inches thick) 

    Bt/E--16 to 25 inches; Bt part (75 percent) brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; E part (25 percent) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; Bt part, many faint clay films bridging sand grains; 10 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, 15 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 14 inches thick) 

   Cr--25 to 29 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly coarse sand; neutral (pH 6.9). (4 to 16 inches thick) 

   R--29 inches; hard granite bedrock.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT3012.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a layer of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves from 2 inches to the mineral soil surface (Oi horizon); an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 16 inches (A, E horizons); an argillic horizon from 16 to 25 inches (Bt/E horizon); a particle-size control section from 16 to 25 inches (Bt/E horizon); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 25 to 29 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 29 inches (R horizon).  Skyview soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
