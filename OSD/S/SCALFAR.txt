SCALFAR SERIES

The Scalfar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of loess.  Scalfar soils are on mountains, hills, and fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amelar, Broad, Custco, Dra, Drage, Milk, Rawnjay, Remount, Searla, Sheep Creek, Small, and Swampydraw series.

Amelar soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 38 to 50 cm and have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Broad, Milk, Sheep Creek, and Small soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Custco soils have argillic horizons with 18 to 27 percent clay and Bk horizons that directly underlie the argillic horizon. Dra soils have 40 to 50 cm thick mollic epipedon. Drage soils have the upper boundary of the argillic horizon at depths below 13 cm and have Bk horizons that directly underlie the base of the argillic at depths of 46 to 94 cm.  Rawnjay soils have the upper boundary of the argillic horizon at depths below 13 cm and have a typic xeric moisture regime.  Remount soils do not have calcic horizons and average more than 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Searla soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 64 to 127 cm and have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Swampydraw soils have mean annual soil temperature of 3 to 6 degrees C and have Bk horizons that directly underlie the base of the argillic horizon at depths of 46 to 58 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scalfar soils are on mountains, hills, and fan remnants, typically summit positions.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff with a component of loess.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 380 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 65 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pequop, Shalcleav, and Tweener soils.  Pequop soils have the base of the argillic horizon at 40 to 150 cm from the soil surface and do not have calcic horizons.  Shalcleav and Tweener soils are very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Scalfar soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 25.
