SPINNEY SERIES

The Spinney series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Spinney soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches (483 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. (4.3 degrees C.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Histic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Spinney mucky peat, on a 1 percent slope in a wet meadow at an elevation of 9,550 feet (2911 meters).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 2, 1988 the soil was wet throughout.

     Oe--0 to 10 inches; mucky peat; clear smooth boundary.

     A--10 to 18 inches; very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

     Ag--18 to 26 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) very gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak very fine subangular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 15 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.

     Cg1--26 to 32 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common distinct dark greenish gray (5BG 4/1) and greenish gray (5G 5/1) iron depletions; 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.

     Cg2--32 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) gravelly sandy loam, dark gray (5Y4/1) moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 5 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Park County, Colorado; about 10 kilometers (6 miles) northeast  of Como; located about 600 feet south and 600 feet west of the northeast corner of section 14, T 8 S, R 76 W; Milligan Lakes USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 21 minutes 42 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees 50 minutes 48 seconds W., NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Boquet series.
The Boquet soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the middle horizons, above a lithologic discontinuity with gravelly and very gravelly textures. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium
Landform:  flood plains
Slopes:  0 to 1 percent
Elevation:  2438 to 3109 meters (8,000 to 10,200 feet)
Mean annual temperature:  1.7 to 4.4 degrees C (35 to 40 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  254 to 584 mm (10 to 23 inches)
Frost-free period:  50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Platdon series.  The Platdon soils do not have a histic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained, moderately slow permeability, occasionally flooded for brief periods during the months of April through August.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists mainly of tufted hairgrass, Nebraska sedge, slender wheatgrass, Baltic rush, and ovalhead sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A, 48B; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, 2010; Teller-Park Area soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is taken from Spinney Mountain from the southern part of Park County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 20 to 50 inches (part of the Ag, Cg1, part of the Cg2 horizon)
Histic epipedon: from 0 to 25 cm.  (Oe horizon)
Mollic epipedon:  from 25 to 66 cm.  (A, Ag horizons)
Redoximorphic depletions:  In the zone from 46 to 81 cm. (Ag, Cg1 horizons)
Endosaturation and aquic conditions:  The zone from 0 to 152 cm. (entire pedon)
Irregular decrease in organic matter: inferred from textural variability and landscape position.
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
