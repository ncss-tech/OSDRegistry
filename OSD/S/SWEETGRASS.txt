SWEETGRASS SERIES

The Sweetgrass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and are moderately deep to very deep over extremely gravelly coarse sands.  These soils are on plains, alluvial fans, stream terraces, and relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, smectitic over mixed, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sweetgrass gravelly loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).
