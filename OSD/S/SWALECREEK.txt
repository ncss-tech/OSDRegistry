SWALECREEK SERIES

The Swalecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt mixed with loess. Swalecreek soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments on plateaus and in drainageway escarpments on hills. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Swalecreek silt loam cultivated on a 1 percent northwest-facing slope at an elevation of 1,640 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--6 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 16 to 23 inches)

 BAt--18 to 22 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

 Bt1--22 to 31 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--31 to 47 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 35 to 40 inches )

 Btc--47 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces; many hard manganese concretions (1 to 2 mm) in size; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION: Klickitat County, about 1.5 miles south of Centerville; 1,000 feet south and 1,750 feet east of the northwest corner of section 24, T.3N., R.15E. (Latitude 45 degrees, 44 minutes, 09 seconds N. and Longitude 120 degrees, 52 minutes, 34 seconds W.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, but are in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some horizon or subhorizon in the upper 30 inches of the profile. The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.
The BAt or BA horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist. It has 18 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 3 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.
The Bt and Btc horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3, 4 or 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam or clay loam. It has 18 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swalecreek soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments on plateaus and in drainageway escarpments on hills.   Elevation is 400 to 2,600 feet. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from basalt. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. The average January temperature is 29 degrees F., and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Goldendale, Konert, Konner, Niva and Mondovi series. Goldendale soils are on terraces and have a mollic epipedon of less than 20 inches. Konert and Konner soils are in drainageways and are somewhat poorly drained. Niva soils are on ridges and have a duripan less than 20 inches. Mondovi soils are on flood plains and are fine-silty and generally have a mollic epipedon more than 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to moderate runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for cropland. Native vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, wild rose and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington. MLRA 8. The series is of moderate extent.
