STUNNER SERIES

The Stunner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and outwash derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist. Stunner soils are on fan remnants, outwash fans, alluvial fans, fan terraces, plateaus, and valley-filling sideslopes and have slopes of 1 to  20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Calciargids

(8 to 24 inches thick)

    Bk3--36 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable; many dark colored mineral grains; secondary carbonate as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; strongly effervescent but with less carbonate than in the horizon above; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
