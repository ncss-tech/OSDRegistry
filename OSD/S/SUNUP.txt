SUNUP SERIES

The Sunup series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to hard bedrock.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous shale and sandstone.  Sunup soils are on hillslopes and ridges.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sunup very channery clay loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very channery clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; 40 percent small, hard shale channers; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

      C--5 to 14 inches; olive (5Y 5/3) very channery clay loam, olive (5Y 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; 40 percent small, hard slate and shale channers; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 16 inches thick)

      R--14 inches; hard shale interbedded with slate and fine grained sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Johnson County, Wyoming; NW1/4, SE1/4 of sec. 20, T. 42 N., R. 83 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by peak precipitation periods during April, May, and early June.  Aridic bordering on Ustic..
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 53 degrees F.
Depth to lithic contact:  5 to 20 inches to hard shale interbedded with slate and fine grained sandstone
EC:  2 mmhos or less throughout.

Particle size control section:  18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 52 percent sand with more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser; rock fragments of hard shale or slate and less commonly sandstone range from 35 to 70 percent channers and 0 to 5 percent flagstones

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR through of 5Y
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture:  clay loam or sandy loam modified by 35 to 60 percent rock fragments
Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.

C horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR through 5Y
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture:  loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam modified by 35 to 70 percent rock fragments
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 8 percent
Reaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline

A thin Bk may be present in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Atchee, Daklos, Farfall, Meriwhitica, Nonip, Redsun, Reef, Skos, Teesto, and Windcomb series.

Atchee, Farfall, Redsun, Reef, Windcomb:  have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Daklos:  rock fragments are rounded gravel and cobble of sandstone origin
Meriwhitica:  has a layer of with greater than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent
Nonip, Teesto:  have soil moisture control sections that are drier during April through June.
Skos:  have hue redder than 7.5YR

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from calcareous shale and sandstone.
Landform:  hillslopes and ridges
Slopes:  5 to 50 percent
Elevation:  4,000 to 6,700 feet
Mean annual precipitation:  10 to 15 inches with about half falling as snow and rain in April, May, and early June
Mean annual temperature:  44 to 49 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  95 to 130 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and local air drainage.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kishona and Threetop soils and the competing Travson series.  Kishona soils are deep and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout.  Threetop soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff depending upon slope and surface channer cover; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, big sagebrush, and needleleaf sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and north central Wyoming.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  The series is of moderate extent.
