SATANKA SERIES

The Satanka series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on ridges and hillslopes. They formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Average annual precipitation is 12 inches. The average annual air temperature is 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 85 to 110 days.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Satanka fine sandy loam, 5 percent slope - rangeland (Colors are for dry unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3 ) fine sandy loam,  dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine  granular structure;  weak platy in the upper inch; soft , very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; slightly alkaline ( pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

     Bt--4 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3 ) sandy clay loam, brown  (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard , friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; faint nearly continuous clay films on ped faces; slightly alkaline ( pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 5 inches thick)

     Bk1 --9 to 13 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2 ) sandy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard , friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; strongly effervescent, carbonates disseminated and as few fine and medium soft masses, threads, and seams; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

     Bk2--13 to 35 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2 ) sandy clay loam, light yellowish-brown (2.5Y 6/3)moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; strongly effervescent, carbonates disseminated and as common fine and medium soft masses, threads, and seams; numerous partially weathered shale chips that break down when wetted; strongly alkaline ( pH 8.6); diffuse wavy boundary. (5 to 32 inches thick)

     Cr-- 35 inches; soft shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Albany County, Wyoming; 2400 feet west, 50 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 36, T16N, R74W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon:  5 to 10 inches
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate:  0 to 10 inches
Depth to paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to weathered shale

Particle-size control section:  18 to 30 percent clay with more than 45 percent fine sand or coarser, rock fragment content is typically less than 10 percent but ranges from 0 to 25 percent throughout.

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist
Textures:  sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam
Reaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  5 or 6 dry,  4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist
Reaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline

Bk horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  6 to 14 percent
Reaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: Current competitors are the Almy, Bateson, Bluerim, Diamondville, Forelle, Maysprings, and Taffom series.

Almy, Bateson, Forelle, Maysprings, Taffom:  does not have a lithic or paralithic contact with 60 inches of the surface
Bluerim:  does not have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations
Diamondville:  have less than 45 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle size control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale
Landform:  hillslopes and cuestas
Slopes:  0 to 20 percent
Elevation:  6,000 to 7,800 feet
Mean annual precipitation:  10 to 14 inches
Mean annual temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  85 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackhall, Blazon, and the competing  Diamondville and Cushool series. The Blackhall and Blazon soils are shallow and occur on steeper hillslopes.  The Diamondville and Cushool soils have deeper Bt horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly needleandthread, thickspike wheatgrass, indian ricegrass, and silver sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Wyoming.  The series is of small extent.
