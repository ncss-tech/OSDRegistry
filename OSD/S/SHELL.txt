SHELL SERIES

The Shell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified silty and loamy alluvium. Shell soils are on bottomlands.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Shell silt loam, 1 percent slope in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Ap--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, very friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

	A--8 to 24 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; hard, very friable; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (A horizon is 20 to 36 inches thick)

	C1--24 to 33 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown  (10YR 3/2) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable; weak medium and fine bedding planes; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

	C2--33 to 55 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown  (10YR 3/2) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; few fine faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; mottles; massive; hard, very friable; weak fine bedding planes; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

	C3--55 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few fine faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; mottles; massive; hard, very friable; weak fine bedding planes; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

Bw horizon.
Gabaldon soils have a B horizon and are calcareous throughout.
Hord soils have carbonates above a depth of 48 inches and have a B horizon.
Irak soils have hues redder than 10YR.
Muir soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon above a depth of 50 inches and have a B horizon.
