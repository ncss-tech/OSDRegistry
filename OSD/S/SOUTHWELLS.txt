SOUTHWELLS SERIES

The Southwells series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in sandy and loamy drift on disintegration moraines, end moraines, and kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Alfic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Southwells loamy sand, on a 6 percent slope in a forested area on an end moraine. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 2 cm (1 inch); black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; about 3 percent fine gravel; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [2 to 8 cm (1 to 3 inches) thick]

[51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick]

 B/E--145 to 168 cm (57 to 66 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt); Bt part also occurs as lamellae 6 mm to 2.5 cm (1/4 to 1 inch) thick; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; occupies about 60 percent of the horizon extending into isolated remnants of pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand (E), light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; about 7 percent fine gravel; neutral; abrupt broken boundary. [8 to 35 cm (3 to 14 inches) thick]

 C1--168 to 185 cm (66 to 73 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam; massive; friable; about 7 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt broken boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 C2--185 to 203 cm (73 to 80 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand; single grain; loose; about 7 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Keweenaw, Leelanau, Mancelona, and Melita series. Keweenaw soils have hue redder than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section. Leelanau soils have an E/B horizon that is less than 51 cm (20 inches) thick. Mancelona soils are less than 127 cm (50 inches) to carbonates. Melita soils average less than 52 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Southwells soils are on disintegration moraines, end moraines, and kames. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The Southwells soils formed in sandy and loamy drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are the somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska soils and Islandlake soils on similar landscape positions. Kalkaska soils are sandy throughout and Islandlake soils have lamellae of sand or loamy sand.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is in forestland. Forest vegetation consists chiefly of sugar maple, American beech black cherry, American basswood, and bigtooth aspen. Some areas are in cropland, pasture, or idle cropland. The principal crops are small grain, hay and potatoes. Small areas of Christmas trees plantations are also present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in northern lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
