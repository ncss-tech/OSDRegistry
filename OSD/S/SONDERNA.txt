COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: fan terraces on alluvial fans; fan terraces on alluvial fans on mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over sandy and gravelly alluvium
Elevation: 2,244 to 3,294 feet (684 to 1,004 m)
Slope: 0 to 22 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 35 inches (700 to 894 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 60 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Basaltlake, Elting, and Klute soils. Basaltlake and Elting soils are well drained, very deep and occur on mountains. Klute soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loamy part of the profile and high to very high in the sandy and gravelly part of the profile.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is white spruce/green alder forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
