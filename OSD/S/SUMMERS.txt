SUMMERS SERIES

The Summers series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from coarse grained sandstone with thin shale strata.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Summers soils are on upland ridges.  Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, frigid Humic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Summers on a 3 to 15 percent slope in a wooded area at an elevation of 4008 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

    Oe--1 to 1.5 inches;  moderately decomposed forest litter.

    Oa--1.5 to 2 inches;  highly decomposed forest litter.

    A1--2 to 10 inches;  very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very channery sandy loam; moderate fine and medium granular structure; very friable; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 40 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (7 to 9 inches thick).

    A2--10 to 13 inches;  dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very channery sandy loam; moderate fine and medium granular structure; very friable; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 40 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick).

    BA--13 to 20 inches;  dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) very channery sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine and fine roots; 40 percent rock fragments; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick.)

    Bw--20 to 28 inches;  yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very channery sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine and fine roots; 40 percent rock fragments; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (7 to 14 inches thick.)

    C--28 to 30 inches;  yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) extremely channery sandy loam; massive; friable; few very fine roots; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles;  65 percent rock fragments; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick.)

    R--30 inches;  fractured grayish brown (10YR 5/2) medium grained sandstone. Excavation difficulty, very high.

TYPE LOCATION:  Greenbrier County, West Virginia, on Clear Creek Mountain; approximately 3.75 miles southeast of the town of Duo.  U.S.G.S. Duo topographic quadrangle; Latitude 38 degrees, 2 minutes, 5 seconds N., Longitude 80 degrees, 32 minutes, 40 seconds W; NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle size control section averages less than 18 percent clay.  Percent coarse fragments range from 20 to 50 percent in the A horizon, 20 to 45 percent in the BA and Bw horizon, 35 to 60 percent in the BC horizon and 50 to 70 percent in the C horizon with the particle size control section averaging more than 35 percent. Reaction is strongly acid through very strongly acid throughout.

The A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.

The BA and Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.

Some pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.

The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Summers soils formed in residuum from coarse grained sandstone containing a few thin shale strata on smooth, nearly level to strongly sloping uplands on ridgetops.  Slope gradient range from 0 to 25 percent.  Climate is humid continental with long winter snow cover.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches, frost free days range from 90 to 130 days and elevation ranges from about 3000 to 6000 feet above sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Briery, Gauley ,Leatherbark, Mandy Simoda, Snowdog, and Trussel soils.  Briery, Gauley, Leatherbark, Mandy Simoda, Snowdog, and Trussel soils lack the thick dark umbric epipedon.  Simoda and Snowdog soils are moderately well drained and have a fragipan.  Snowdog soils also formed in colluvium.  Leatherbark soils are somewhat poorly drained, and Trussel soils are poorly drained and have a fragipan.  Trussel soils also formed in colluvium.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for woodland which consists of American beech, red oak, black cherry, sugar maple, red maple, white ash, and yellow birch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 127.  In West Virginia and possibly Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.  The soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Summers County, West Virginia, 1924.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly classified in the Sols Bruns Acides great soil group and more recently as a loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Haplumbrept.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Umbric epipedon - The zone from 2 to 13 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).

Cambic horizon - The zone from 13 to 28 inches (Bw horizon).

Skeletal features - Approximately 42 percent (by volume) weighted average rock fragments in the 10 to 30 inch control section.

Additional Data: Refer to pedons S98WV-025-001 (typical pedon), S98WV-025-003, and S98WV-025-004 for characterization data analysis by West Virginia University Soil Characterization Laboratory.

Revision- 
2/2022 -  The L layer was removed from the typical pedon description because /freshly fallen, or undecomposed leaf litter or simlar undeceomposed material should not be included as a surface layer in the soil description.  The typical pedon originally had a top layer described as undecomposed leaf material or similar undecomposed material. WJN
