STUBENVILLE SERIES

The Stubenville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty lacustrine deposits. The Stubenville soils are on dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 35 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Stubenville silt loam, on a 50 percent slope in a forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 2 cm (0 to 1 inch); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate very fine granular structure; friable; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [2 to 8 cm (1 to 3 inches) thick]

 E--2 to 15 cm (1 to 6 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 inches) thick]

 BE--15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 10 percent brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam filling worm casts and root channels; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bt1--25 to 43 cm (10 to 17 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine vesicular and tubular pores; common faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--43 to 66 cm (17 to 26 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common very fine vesicular and tubular pores; common distinct brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt3--66 to 91 cm (26 to 36 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine vesicular and tubular pores; many distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 51 to 81 cm (20 to 32 inches).]

 C--91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt with 20 percent thin strata of silty clay loam; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; very friable; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine vesicular and tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Marseilles, Mentor, Pottersville, Sandview, Westmore, and Zenas (T) series. Marseilles soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Mentor soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to carbonates. Pottersville and Sandview soils have subhorizons in the lower part of the argillic horizon that average more than 40 percent clay. Westmore soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Zenas soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stubenville soils are on backslopes of dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 35 to 70 percent. The soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dubois, Haubstadt, Hickory, Otwell, Peoga, and Wirt soils. The somewhat poorly drained Dubois soils are on flats of lake plains. The moderately well drained Haubstadt soils are on summits and shoulders of dissected lake plains. The Hickory soils formed in till and are on lower lying backslopes. The moderately well drained Otwell soils are on backslopes of dissected lake plains. The poorly drained Peoga soils are on broad flats of lake plains. The Wirt soils are on flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all areas are in forest. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Indiana; MLRA 114B. The series is of small extent.
