SECUNDA SERIES

The Secunda series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain side slopes and ridges.  They formed in material from quartzite and phyllite of the Wallace Formation of the Belt supergroup that is blanketed by a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 10 to 75 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 39 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Secunda soils are on mountain sides.  Slopes range from 10 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in quartzite or phyllite with a thick mantle of volcanic ash at elevations of 2,710 to 5,048 feet (827 to 1539 meters).   The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F, with an average annual precipitation of 36 to 48 inches (914 to 1219 mm).  The frost free season is 50 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Disalto, Flewsie and Bouldercreek soils.  Disalto soils have a horizon formed in loess and are on mountain sides and ridge summits.  Flewsie soils lack evidence of clay movement and are on steep mountain sides. Bouldercreek soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments below an ash cap and are on steep mountain sides.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western hemlock, western larch, western white pine, and Douglas-fir with an understory of queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, one-sided wintergreen, princes pine, common snowberry and myrtle boxwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Idaho. The series is not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
