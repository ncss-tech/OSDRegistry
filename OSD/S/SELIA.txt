SELIA SERIES

The Selia series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy alluvium or eolian sands.  These soils are on bottom lands or in basins of the sandhills.  Slopes generally are less than 1 percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 51 centimeters (20 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Natraqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Selia loamy fine sand with a one percent, southeast-facing slope in native grass.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)  When described, the soil was dry throughout.  

  A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) loamy fine sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) thick)

  E--8 to 10 centimeters (3 to 4 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) fine sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; single grained; loose; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 10 centimeters (1/2 to 4 inches) thick)

  Btn1--10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) loamy fine sand, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak coarse columnar structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; very hard, friable; few clay bridgings between sand grains; many fine and medium threadlike accumulations of carbonates; strong effervescence; very strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  Btn2--30 to 41 centimeters (12 to 16 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; very hard, friable; few clay bridgings between sand grains; few fine thread-like accumulations of carbonates; slight effervescence; very strongly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of B2t horizons is 18 to 46 centimeters (7 to 18 inches) thick)

  Bn--41 to 64 centimeters (16 to 25 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6 moist) mottles; weak coarse prismatic structure; very hard, friable; few fine thread-like accumulations of carbonates; slight effervescence; very strongly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches) thick)

  C1--64 to 102 centimeters (25 to 40 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; common medium and fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 5/4 moist) mottles; single grained; loose; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 51 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick)

  C2--102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10 YR 4/2) moist; common medium and fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 5/4 moist) mottles; single grained; loose; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Land form: bottom lands and stream terraces of major stream valleys and in basins of the sandhills
Parent material: sandy alluvium or eolian material  
Exchangeable sodium: High
Slope: typically less than 1 percent, but ranges from 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 43 to 58 centimeters (17 to 23 inches) 
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. (47 to 52 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Els, Elsmere, Gannett, Ipage, Loup, Lute, Ord, Tryon, Valentine and Whitlake soils.  
All of these associated soils lack a natric horizon, except for Lute and Whitelake soils.  
Lute and Whitelake soils are on similar landscape positions.  
Els, Elsmere, and Ord soils are in similar topographic positions.  
Gannett, Loup, and Tryon soils are slightly lower in the landscape and are poorly or very poorly drained.  
Ipage and Valentine soils are higher in the landscape and are better drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained
Runoff: low  
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately low over high
Seasonal high water table: 46 centimeters (1.5 feet) in most wet years, 76 centimeters (2.5 feet) in most dry years  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Native range or hayland.  
Native vegetation includes mostly alkali sacaton, inland saltgrass, western wheatgrass, plains bluegrass, foxtail barley, alkali cordgrass, and sedges.  
In places, the vegetation is sparse.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  In and near the sandhill areas of Nebraska.  The series is of small extent.
