SEXTON SERIES 

The Sexton series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on outwash plains and stream terraces. They formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying stratified outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches (991 mm) and mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Concord, Elbert, Kampville, Traer, and Weir series. Concord soils are generally less than 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. Elbert soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches. Kampville, Traer and Weir soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the upper 55 inches of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sexton soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loess or silty material 30 to 55 inches (76 to 140 cm) thick and in the underlying stratified outwash. Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 45 inches (813 to 1143 mm); frost free period ranges from 160 to 200 days; and elevation ranges from 340 to 1020 feet (104 to 311 meters) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Sexton soils are the poorly drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the well drained Camden soils and the somewhat poorly drained Starks soils. It is also associated with the well drained St. Charles soils and the somewhat poorly drained Kendall soils which are formed in 40 to 60 inches (102 to 152 cm) of loess or silty material and the underlying outwash. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to low (0.01 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second).  Permeability is slow. A seasonal high water table is within a depth of 1 foot at some time between January and June in normal years. Flooding is typically none or rare, however, a commonly flooded phase is recognized (see remarks). 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used largely for growing corn, soybeans, and small grain. Native vegetation is hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Illinois and possibly Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri. The extent is moderate in MLRAs 108B, 113, 115A, and 115C. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shelby County, Illinois, 1939. 

REMARKS: With the update of 03/2005, the location of the typical pedon was moved from Edwards County, Illinois to Edgar County, Illinois, the classification was changed to reflect endo-saturation rather than epi-saturation, and the great group was changed from Chromic Vertic to Typic because the LEP for these soils is less than required for soils in the Vertic great group. The pedon at the new location better fits the concept of a non-vertic soil with endo saturation. 

A commonly flooded phase of Sexton is presently recognized. This phase will be evaluated during MLRA update to determine if new series is needed. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (0 to 30 cm) (Ap and Eg horizons); 
albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) (Eg horizon); 
argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 12 to 45 inches (30 to 114 cm)(Btg part of Btg/Eg, Btg1, Btg2, and 2BCtg horizons); 
aquic conditions - redoximorphic features in all horizons below 8 inches;
