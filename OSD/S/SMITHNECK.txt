SMITHNECK SERIES

The Smithneck series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Smithneck soils are on flood plains or alluvial fans. Slopes are 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 475 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argixerolls

TYPE LOCATION: Sierra County, California; approximately 1/2 mile southeast of Loyalton, near the Smithneck Canyon Road, 1,420 feet north and 20 feet east of the south 1/4 corner sec. 18, T.21N., R.16E. WGS84 39.668776 latitude and -120.230981 longitude;  UTM zone 10, 4394661 meters N, 737518 meters E WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm is 10 to 11 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a mesic temperature regime.

Soil Moisture: The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section (about 20 to 60 cm) is usually dry in all parts from July 15 to November 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.

Diagnostic Feature(s):
  Mollic epipedon thickness: 28 to 48 cm
  Argillic horizon thickness:  40 to 110 cm

Water Features: Seasonal high water table: 70 cm
  Flooding: rare, very brief from January through March

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Beckwourth series. Beckwourth soils have secondary carbonates in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Smithneck soils are on flood plains, stream terraces or footslopes of alluvial fans. Elevation is 1,570 to 1,795 meters. Slopes are 1 to 10 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 315 to 685 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. The frost free season is 90 to 145 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Balman, Bidwell, Coolbrith, James Canyon and Ramelli soils. The Calman soils are fine-loamy and have calcareous A horizons. Bidwell soils have calcareous Bt horizons and are fine-loamy. Coolbrith soils have Bt horizons with 27 to 35 percent clay. James Canyon soils are fine-loamy and are poorly drained. The Ramelli soils are clayey over loamy and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity, slow runoff; A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 70 to 150 cm at some time from December to June. Flooding is rare for very brief periods from January through March. Drained phases are recognized that have a seasonal high water table at 1.7 to 2 meters due to stream channel entrenchment.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for growing alfalfa and small grains, wheatgrass pastures and native meadow. The vegetation is mainly perennial and annual meadow grasses, forbs and silver sagebrush. Drained phases have big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Sierra County and Western Plumas County, California. These soils are of small extent.
