SMITHNECK SERIES

The Smithneck series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Smithneck soils are on flood plains or alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Smithneck sandy loam - on a nearly level slope in a field of wheatgrass and alfalfa at about 4,980 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak thick platy and moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine medium roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

     A2--6 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak thick platy and moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

     AB--15 to 23 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak, medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular and interst,tial pores; common clay films lining pores and as bridges; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 9 inches thick)

     Bt--23 to 32 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; few fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottles, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, friable, sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and common medium tubular and interstitial pores; many thin clay films lining pores and as bridges; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

     C--32 to 48 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) mottles moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine and common medium tubular and interstitial pores; common thin clay films lining pores and as bridges; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

     2C--48 to 60 inches; this horizon consists mainly of stratified fine gravel, gravelly loamy coarse sand and sandy loam which are light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) with white mineral grains, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) with common fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) mottles moist.

TYPE LOCATION: Sierra County, California; approximately 1/2 mile southeast of Loyalton, near the Smithneck Canyon Road, 1,420 feet north and 20 feet east of the south 1/4 corner sec. 18, T. 21 N., R. 16 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is 18 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 11 to 19 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches varies from 50 degrees to 52 degrees F. The soil moisture control section, about 8 to 24 inches, is usually dry all of the time from July 15 to November 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year. The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 15 to November 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 1 to November 1.

The A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3. Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with 10 to 15 percent clay.

The Bt horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 4/2. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 15 to 18 percent clay. Absolute clay increase from the A to the Bt horizon is 3 to 6 percent.

The C horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/2 or 2.5Y 7/2. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4. It is more or less stratified and ranges in texture from gravelly loamy coarse sand to sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Smithneck soils are on flood plains, stream terraces or footslopes of alluvial fans. Elevation is 4,500 to 5,400 feet. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. The climate is dry subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 25 inches. Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. Frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Balman, Bidwell, Coolbrith, James Canyon and Ramelli soils. The Calman soils are fine-loamy and have calcareous A horizons. Bidwell soils have calcareous Bt horizons and are fine-loamy. Coolbrith soils have Bt horizons with 27 to 35 percent clay. James Canyon soils are fine-loamy and are poorly drained. The Ramelli soils are clayey over loamy and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability. A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time from December to June. Flooding is rare for very brief periods from January through March. Drained phases are recognized that have a seasonal high water table at 5 to 6 feet due to stream channel entrenchment.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for growing alfalfa and small grains, wheatgrass pastures and native meadow. The vegetation is mainly perennial and annual meadow grasses, forbs and silver sagebrush. Drained phases have big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Sierra County and Western Plumas County, Callfornia. These soils are of small extent.
