TYPE LOCATION: Burlington County, New Jersey, Springfield Township.  Cultivated field .2 miles north of Oxmead Road 75 feet east of Gilbert's Lane.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum Thickness: 24 to 40 inches or more 
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 120 inches
Content of Glauconite: 5 to 20 percent in the A horizon, and 10 to 20 percent in the B and C horizons.  Below 60 inches, glauconite content ranges from 0 to 40 percent or more.
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 12 inches below the surface, mostly during the months of October to June
Rock Fragments: 0 to 15 percent, by volume in the A and B horizons and 0 to 35 percent in the C horizons above 40 inches. Below 40 inches, gravel content ranges from 0 to 50 percent by volume. The gravel is mainly rounded quartzose, ironstone, or fragments of discontinuous crusts.
Soil Reaction: Extremely acid to very strongly acid, unless limed

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

O horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, chroma of 1 to 3
Texture--Peat, mucky peat, or muck

A or Ap horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 to 3
Texture--sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam
Redoximorphic features--iron accumulations in shades of red or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray (where present)

Ag horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 or 2
Texture--sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam
Redoximorphic features--iron accumulations in shades of red or brown and iron depletions in shades of gray (where present)  

Btg horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5Y to 5GY, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture--sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam 
Redoximorphic features--iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, brown, or olive and (where present), iron depletions in shades of gray

Cg horizon:
Color-- hue of 2.5Y to 5GY, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2

Redoximorphic features--iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, brown, or olive and (where present), iron depletions in shades of gray

COMPETING SERIES:
Chatuge--do not contain glauconite and formed in alluvium washed from surrounding residual soils,on stream terraces
Baile--do not contain glauconite and formed in local alluvium washed over residuum, on stream terraces

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Atlantic Coastal Plain
Landform: Flats and depressions
Elevation: 10 to 100 feet
Parent Material: Loamy marine sediments that contain moderate amounts of glauconite that have been influenced by eolian or alluvial action in places
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 45 to 55 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 40 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 160 to 215 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Adelphia--are moderately well drained, with similar glauconite contents, on slightly higher landforms
Keansburg--are very poorly drained, with thick dark surfaces, on lower landscapes
Jaderun--are poorly drained, lack argillic horizons, in a coarse-silty family, and contain less glauconite throughout the profile
Collington--are well drained, with similar glauconite contents, on higher landforms 
Buddtown--are moderately well drained, contain less glauconite, , in a coarse-loamy family, on slightly higher areas
Holmdel--are moderately well drained, and contain lesse glauconite, on similar landforms 
Pemberton--are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained, with thick sandy surfaces, on slightly higher landforms
Freehold--are well drained, with glauconitic mineralogy 
Tinton--are well drained, with thick sandy surfaces, on higher landforms

MAJOR USES: Drained areas grow corn, soybeans, small grains, hay, pasture, and turf grasses. A few areas are used for blueberries and vegetables.

VEGETATION: Wooded areas are dominantly oaks, willow, yellow poplar, sweet gum, red maple, beech, and holly.  Understory species include highbush blueberry, spicebush, viburnum, and greenbriar.

DISTRIBUTION: Southern New Jersey, and similar positions in Maryland and possibly Delaware

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monmouth County, New Jersey, 1927

REMARKS: This revision establishes a more definitive range for the glauconite content of these soils and places them in a class containing moderate amounts of glauconite within the control section (10 to 20 percent). In addition, it assigns an active cation-exchange activity class to the series.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and Ag horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 14 to 32 inches (Btg horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 60 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
