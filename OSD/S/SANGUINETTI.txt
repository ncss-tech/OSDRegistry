SANGUINETTI SERIES

The Sanguinetti series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from phyllite and/or schist. The Sanguinetti soils are on side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 805 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sanguinetti soils are on steep hillslopes and canyons. Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from phyllite and/or schist. Elevation is 245 to 995 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 650 to 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 180 to 295 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deerflat, Millvilla, Moccasinhill, and Priestgrade, soils. The Deerflat soils are on footslopes of canyons and are very deep and fine-loamy. The Millvilla soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and have an argillic horizon. The Moccasinhill soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact, and have an umbric epipedon. The Priestgrade soils are on shoulders of canyons and are shallow to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is interior live oak, blue oak, California foothill pine, Pacific poison oak, whiteleaf manzanita, toyon, buckbrush, chaparral coffeeberry, and squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18.  The series is moderately extensive.
