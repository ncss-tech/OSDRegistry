SWALESILVER SERIES

The Swalesilver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Swalesilver soils are on depressions on plateaus and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: At present, there are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swalesilver soils are on depressions on plateaus and lake terraces. These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,280 to 1,910 meters. The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Floke, Ninemile, Ratto, Spangenburg, and Swaler soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; very high surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Episaturation is present with perched free water between the soil surface and 30 cm (very shallow free water occurrence class) from November through May. Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent. These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration at some time from November through May with water depths of 3 to 30 cm. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Swalesilver soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly silver sagebrush, Nevada bluegrass, creeping wildrye, and mat muhly. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lake County (Southern Part), Oregon, 1991. 

REMARKS: A revision in 2001 moved the type location from Lake County to Harney County, Oregon to better represent the series concept. The prior type location had high glass content in the A horizons and classified as a vitrandic intergrade. Future study is needed on this soil to document whether enough active ferrous iron occurs in the A horizons, when aquic conditions are present, to give positive reactions to alpha,alpha-dipyridyl. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons). 
Aquic conditions - The conditions of episaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 15 cm at certain times during normal years (A1 and A2 horizons). 
Argillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 58 cm (2Btl and 2Bt2 horizons). 
Abrupt textural change - The abrupt clay increase of more than 20 percent at 15 cm (between the A2 and 2Bt1 horizons). 
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 58 to 86 cm (3Bk horizon). 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 58 cm (2Btl and 2Bt2 horizons).
