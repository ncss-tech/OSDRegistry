STINESVILLE SERIES

The Stinesville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol formed in till and residuum from limestone. The Stinesville soils are on hills and in sinkholes on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crider, Hootentown, Navilleton, Peridge, Ryker, and Winnipeg series. Crider soils are formed in loess and residuum from limestone. Hootentown soils average more than 0.5 percent organic carbon in the lower part of the series control section. Navilleton soils average more than 45 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Peridge soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Ryker soils have some part of the argillic horizon above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) that has rock fragments. Winnipeg soils are formed in loess, hillslope sediments, colluvium, or residuum and are on structural benches, strath terraces, and footslopes.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stinesville soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of hills and in sinkholes on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent. The soils formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol formed in till and residuum from limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grayford and Ryker soils. The deep Grayford soils are typically on steeper backslopes. The Ryker soils have a thinner loess mantle and are on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for growing corn, soybeans, or small grain. Some areas are used for hay or pasture. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Indiana; MLRA 114B. The series is of small extent.
