SARPY SERIES

The Sarpy series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in sandy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

 Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [5 to 23 centimeters (2 to 9 inches) thick]
