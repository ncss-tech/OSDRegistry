SCHAFFER SERIES

The Schaffer series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to a fragipan. These soils formed in loess and the underlying till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in a closely related family include the Westboro series. Westboro soils have horizons with fragic soil properties that do not meet all of the criteria for a fragipan and classify as Fragiaquic Glossudalfs.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Schaffer soils are on loess-covered till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in 46 to 102 cm (18 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1170 mm (37 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 14 degrees C (48 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 155 to 225 days. Elevation is 271 to 311 meters (890 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Blanchester, Clermont, Jonesboro, Nicely, Rossmoyne, and Westboro soils. Blanchester and Clermont soils are poorly drained and are in depressions or on flats. Jonesboro and Rossmoyne soils are moderately well drained and are on swells or convex parts of the landscape. Nicely soils are moderately well drained and are on shoulder positions. Westboro soils do not have a fragipan and are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or low above and below the fragipan and low in the fragipan. Permeability is slow and very slow above and below the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are being cropped to soybeans and corn. A few areas are used for small grain, hay or pasture or are in woodland. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Ohio; MLRA 114A. The series is of small extent.
