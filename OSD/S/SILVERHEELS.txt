SILVERHEELS SERIES

The Silverheels series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash.  Silverheels soils are on outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bassel, Blaine, Bowen, Fingerrock, Fornor Fourmile, Geertsen, Hoodle, Hungryhill, Lagarita, Lambe, Libeg, Nathale, Nathrop, Norriston, Quander, Ratiopeak, Spanpeak, and Woodhall series.
The Bassel and Geertsen soils are deep to  a lithic contact.
The Blaine, Bowen, Hungryhill, Nathale, Nathrop and Woodhall soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.
The Fingerrock soils have sandy-skeletal horizons below the argillic horizon.
The Fornor, Hoodle, Lagarita, Lambe, and Ratiopeak soils have accumulations of secondary carbonates.
The Fingerrock, Fourmile, Norriston, and Spanpeak soils have sandy-skeletal horizons below the argillic horizon.
The Libeg soils have an ustic soil moisture regime that borders udic, and are more moist in the moisture control section in early summer.
The Quander soils have rock fragments of breccia, trachyte, andesite and other volcanic rocks.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  outwash, derived mainly from granite and gneiss
Landform:  outwash terraces
Slopes:  1 to 5 percent
Elevation:  9,500 to 10,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  35 to 39 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 17 inches
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period:  50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cablon, Platdon, and Monahan series.  The Cablon soils border an aridic moisture regime and are on outwash terraces at lower elevations.  The Platdon soils are very poorly drained and are on flood plains.  The Monahan soils have higher clay content and are on pediments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for hayland. Native vegetation consists mainly of western wheatgrass, slimstem muhly, sleepygrass, prairie Junegrass, blue grama, Parry's oatgrass, mountain muhly, and Arizona fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48B; small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010.  The name is taken from Silverheels Creek nearby.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to below 60 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 30 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 inches.  (A horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 60 inches and below.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
