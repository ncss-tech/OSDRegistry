SHROE SERIES

The Shroe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from ignimbrite and lacustrine sediments influenced by small amounts of pyroclastic materials.  The Shroe soils are on valley fill terraces and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shroe gravelly loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is partially covered with 5 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 3 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 33 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 23 cm thick)

    Bt2--33 to 91 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine through medium and few coarse roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (30 to 46 cm thick)

    2C--91 to 152 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4)

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; in Barnes Canyon, approximately 1 mile south of the southwest corner of section 31, T. 4 S., R. 68 E.; latitude 37 degrees 32 minutes 4 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 25 minutes and 42 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative during July through October due to convection storms; ustic soil moisture that borders on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 18 to 33 cm.
Thickness of argillic horizon: 50 to 90 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  27 to 35 percent.
Rock Fragment: 35 to 50

Bt1 horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Texture: Sandy clay, clay loam, or clay.
Clay content: 35 to 45.
Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent.
Structure: Moderate to strong, medium or fine subangular blocky.
Consistence: Slightly hard or hard.

Bt2 horizon
Hue:  7.5YR or 5YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent.
Texture of the fine earth:  Sandy clay loam or clay loam.
Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent.
Structure:  Weak to moderate, medium or coarse prismatic, parting to moderate angular blocky.

2C horizon
Loamy lacustrine sediments.
Other features:  Thin lime coats may occur on undersides of rock fragments in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Searles, Searvar, Shawmount, Shree, Tollgate, Trid and Tristan series.  

Ashue, Badena, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Shawmount, Shree, Tollgate and Tristan soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizons.  Badena soils contain more than 60 percent coarse fragment in the particle size control section.  Badenaugh soils are greater than 150 cm to the base of the Bt horizon.  Oest soils contain 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle size particle-size control section. Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Searles, Searvar and Trid soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shroe soils are on valley fill terraces and fan piedmonts at elevations of 1,525 to 1,895 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from ignimbrite and lacustrine sediments influenced by small amounts of pyroclastic materials.  The climate is cool continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm; the annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Acoma, Cedaran,  and Minu soils.  Acoma soils lack mollic epipedons.  Cedaran soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 8 degrees C and have lithic contacts within a depth of 50 cm. Minu soils are shallow to an indurated duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant vegetation is Utah juniper with an understory of big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, squirreltail, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  Shroe soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28A,28B,29.
