SESSIONS SERIES

The Sessions series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial till from shale, quartzite and sandstone.  These soils are on ground moraines, glacial basins and kettles of glaciated mountains and have slopes of 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.

TYPE LOCATION:  Wasatch County, Utah; 16.4 miles east from Heber Courthouse on Lake Creek Road past the forest boundary, then 1.8 miles southwest on side road; 2,800 feet north and 1,740 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 36, T. 4 S., R. 6 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 11 to 15 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 58 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.

The A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has 0 to 30 percent rock fragments.  It is neutral or slightly acid.

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay, clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay with more than 35 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent cobbles or gravel.  Clay films are common to continuous, thin to moderately thick.  Some pedons are calcareous below 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sessions soils are on moderately steep and steep ground moraines, glacial basins and kettles of glaciated mountains at elevations of 6,300 to 10,600 feet.  Slope gradients are 2 to 35 percent.  The soils formed mainly in glacial till derived from mixed sedimentary parent rocks, principally sandstone, quartzite, shale but some formed in alluvium on fans in materials from gneiss and schist.  The climate is humid with average annual precipitation of 22 to 35 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 55 to 60 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 20 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baird Hollow, Bertag, Cluff, Ercan, Hawkins, Nordic, Roundy, Skutum, and Toone soils.  These soils all have E horizons.  Baird Hollow and Roundy soils have the upper boundary of the argillic horizons occurring below a 24-inch depth.  Bertag and Skutum soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Cluff soils lack a mollic epipedon and have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Ercan and Nordic soils have E horizons and the argillic horizon is more than 40 inches below the surface.  Hawkins soils lack argillic horizons and cracks to the surface.  Nordic soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon and more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Roundy soils have an abrupt texture change at the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  Toone soils have clay argillic horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for watershed and summer grazing by livestock and wildlife.  Native plants are mountain bromegrass, oniongrass, slender wheatgrass, bearded wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, geranuim, horsemint, peavine, Jacobs' ladder, butterweed, bluebells, snowberry, shrubby cinquefoil, oakbrush, silver sagebrush and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High mountain park areas in northern Utah and adjoining areas of Colorado and Idaho.  This series is moderately extensive.
