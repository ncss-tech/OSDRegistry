SOUTHBALDY SERIES

The Southbaldy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale. Southbaldy soils are on cuestas and structural benches. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Southbaldy loam, on a southeast-facing 19 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 2,646 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is very stony.

    A--0 to 28 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; 6 percent channers and 2 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 76 cm thick)

    Bt1--28 to 48 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 50 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along pores; 12 percent channers and 5 percent flagstone; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt2--48 to 58 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam; brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and few medium roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 70 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along pores; 25 percent channers, 10 percent flagstones and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt irregular boundary. (8 to 50 cm thick)

    R--58 to 152 cm; hard sandstone bedrock
