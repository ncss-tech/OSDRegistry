SCHOONOVER SERIES

The Schoonover series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from limestone.  Schoonover soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Schoonover, on a west facing, concave, 5 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 7,700 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 15, 1994 the soil was dry throughout.

    The surface is covered by 30 percent gravel and 20 percent limestone channers.

A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; few fine vesicular and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 12 percent channers; 5 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

Bk1--3 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few fine vesicular and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 12 percent channers, 5 percent stones; calcium carbonate disseminated and in few rounded soft masses; violently effervescent; 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

Bk2--8 to 11 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine vesicular and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent channers, 5 percent stones; common distinct discontinuous calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; common rounded soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; violently effervescent; 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt irregular boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

R--11 inches; hard limestone bedrock.
