SWIFTCREEK SERIES

The Swiftcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or slide deposits derived from limestone. These soils occur on hills and rotational slides.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Swiftcreek gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

     A--0 to 9 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; few fine and common very fine pores; 15 percent subangular limestone gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

     Bw1--9 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few fine and common very fine dendritic tubular pores; 15 percent subangular limestone gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

     Bw2--30 to 68 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few fine and very fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent subangular limestone gravel, 5 percent limestone flagstones; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bw1 and Bw2 horizons - 40 to 70 cm)

     C--68 to 200 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 25 percent subangular limestone gravel, 15 percent subangular limestone flagstones; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
