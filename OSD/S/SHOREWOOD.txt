SHOREWOOD SERIES

The Shorewood series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey glacial lacustrine sediments and underlying loamy calcareous till, sometimes beginning below the series control section, on glacial lake plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 930 milimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class -- moderately well and somewhat poorly drained. A zone of saturation is found between 30 to 80 centimeters during the wettest monts of normal years in the somewhat poorly drained phase.  A zone of saturation is found between 50 to 1300 centimeters during the wettest monts of normal years in the moderately well drained phase.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity -- 0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second in the upper part (moderately low to moderately high) and 4.23 to 14.11 micormeters per second (moderately high to high) in the underlying fine-loamy till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, and small grains. A small amount is in forest. Native vegetation is savanna and hardwood forests.
