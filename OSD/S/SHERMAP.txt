SHERMAP SERIES

The Shermap series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, landslide deposits, and eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale. Shermap soils are on hills, structural benches, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Shermap loam, on an east-facing 18 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 2,088 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    BC--124 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6). (0 to 50 cm thick)
