SHAFER SERIES

The Shafer series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff and basalt mixed with lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Leptic Haploxererts

TYPICAL PEDON: Shafer clay loam -- on a 4 percent slightly convex east-facing slope at 4,360 feet elevation in rangeland. When described on September 13, 1994, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 1 inch; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin and medium platy structure parting to strong medium and coarse granular; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; cracks 5mm to 15cm wide; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

   BA--1 to 7 inches; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse and very coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; cracks 5mm to 15cm wide; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 13 inches thick)

   Btss1--7 to 18 inches; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; strong very coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common intersecting slickensides; common wedge-shaped aggregates oriented 30 to 40 degrees from horizontal; cracks 5mm to 3cm wide; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

   Btss2--18 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common intersecting slickensides; common wedge-shaped aggregates oriented 30 to 40 degrees from horizontal; cracks 1mm to 2cm wide; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

   Crt--22 to 25 inches; weathered welded tuff with common distinct clay films on the top of the horizon and in fractures; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

   R--25 inches; unweathered welded tuff.

Btq horizons occur in some pedons

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aikman, Breadloaf, Karcal and Lassen series. Aikman soils have Bk horizons with 1 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Breadloaf soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact (stratified silty lacustrine deposits) and have no lithic contact within 40 inches. Karcal soils have an ochric epipedon, a cambic Bss horizon, do not have Btss horizons. Lassen soils have a cambic Bss horizon with hue of 2.5Y and a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shafer soils are on structural benches, hill summits, and footslopes of hills and butte escarpments at elevations of 2,700 to 5,250 feet. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff and basalt mixed with lacustrine deposits. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gwin, Hann and McDesh soils. Gwin soils are shallow to bedrock. Hann soils are have mollic epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick and are very deep. McDesh soils do not have Btss horizons and cracks open to the surface. These soils are on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Shafer soils are used mainly for rangeland. Native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, xeric big sagebrush and biscuitroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 10. Shafer soils are not extensive.
