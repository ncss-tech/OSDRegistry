STEERLAY SERIES 

The Steerlay series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from glacial outwash materials derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks. Steerlay soils are on outwash fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Steerlay soils are on outwash fans and stream terraces. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources such as igneous and metamorphic rock. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Mostval series. Mostval soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 75 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is common. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between December and September.

USE AND VEGETATION: Steerlay soils are used for pastureland, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly sedges and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
