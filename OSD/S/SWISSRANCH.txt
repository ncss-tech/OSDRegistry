SWISSRANCH SERIES

The Swissranch series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from tuff over residuum derived from rhyolite or acidic tuff. The Swissranch soils are on the backslopes and footslopes of high hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.            

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Swissranch ashy fine sandy loam on a northwest-facing, 55 percent, linear slope, under interior live oak, manzanita, and chamise at an elevation of 800 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on August 13, 2009 the soil was dry throughout.)

(0 to 50 cm thick)

 Cr--158 to 200 cm; moderately cemented acidic tuff bedrock, fractured at intervals of 45 to <100 cm; extremely acid (pH 4.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Swissranch soils are on backslopes and footslopes of high hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from acidic tuff or rhyolite. Elevation is 675 to 975 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 970 to 1190 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 195 to 245 days.       

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fuches, Supan, Crozier, McCarthy, and Iron Mountain soils. Fuches soils occupy similar hillslope positions adjacent as Swissranch but are shallow to bedrock. Supan, Iron Mountain, Crozier and McCarthy soils develop on ridges or nearby mountain slopes from basic volcanic rocks including tuff breccia, tuff, or agglomerate. Supan, Crozier, and McCarthy soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Iron Mountain soils are shallow and have a mollic epipedon.	

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the profile. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is very to moderately low.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is mainly shrubs interspaced with some conifers. Shrub species include manzanita, chamise, live oak, and poison oak. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. This series is not extensive.
