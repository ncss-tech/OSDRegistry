SOUTHCAMP SERIES

The Southcamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from porphyritic trachyte flows. The Southcamp soils are on hill-slopes and ridge tops. Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Ultic Palexeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Southcamp very gravelly fine sandy loam on a north facing (10 degree), 70 percent slope at an elevation of 2137 meters. When described on06/14/2004 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Inville soils.  Inville soils are derived from mixed materials consisting of andesite and granodiorite and are formed in outwash and alluvium and averages less than 18 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Southcamp soils are on mountain flanks and hill sides and ridge tops.  Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from porphyritic trachyte. Elevation is 1920 to 2310 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The frost free season is 40 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cagwin, Cassenai, Deerhill and Zephyrcove soils.  The Cagwin and Cassenai soils are on granodiorite, while Deerhill soils are on metamorphics. Zephyrcove soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability, high runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife and recreation. Vegetation is Jeffrey pine, white fir and sugar pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southcamp soils are of minor extent in Nevada in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains
