SPIDER SERIES

The Spider series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. The Spider soils are on summits of erosional fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Duric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  On Hollyhills-Spider association, 2 to 30 percent slopes at an elevation of 2,703 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered by 5 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 65 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at present.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Spider soils are on summits of erosional fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in material from mixed alluvium. Elevations are 2,200 to 3,300 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Cajon, Coyote (T), Gravesumit (T), and Hollyhills (T) soils. Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are found in inset fans. Cajon soils do not have durinodes and are found in inset fans. Coyote soils are on similar landscape positions but have a well developed calcic horizon in addition to durinodes. Gravesumit soils are found on adjacent fans and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section with a calcic and an argillic horizon. Hollyhills soils are on eroded summits and side slopes of the same landscape and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and a zone which is characterized by slight to strong salinity.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low to low runoff; moderately rapid over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Spider soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly desert holly, shadscale, creosotebush and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  San Bernardino County, California, Fort Irwin Soil Survey Area, 2000. The name is from a local rock formation.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:

1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)
2.  Durinodic horizon -- 2 to 14 inches (Bkq1 horizon)
3.  Particle-size control section -- 10 to 40 inches (part
    of the Bkq1, the Bkq2, and part of the Bkq3 horizons)

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 12/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2000. ET
