SWEETLETTE SERIES

The Sweetlette series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on cuestas, escarpments, hillslopes, and structural benches. Slopes are 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 205 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Sweetlette channery loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 25 percent channers; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 cm thick)

 Btk1--8 to 22 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; 10 percent clay films; 2 percent carbonate masses on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.

 Btk2--22 to 65 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) channery clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 30 percent channers; 15 percent clay films; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Btk1 and Btk2 horizons 35 to 100 cm)

 Bk--65 to 95 cm; pale olive (5Y 6/3) very channery clay loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular structure; friable, slightly hard, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 35 percent channers; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 35 cm thick)

 BCk--95 to 115 cm; pale olive (5Y 6/3) very channery clay loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, very sticky, very plastic; 40 percent gravel; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8). (0 to 70 cm thick)

 Cr--115 cm; sandstone bedrock.
