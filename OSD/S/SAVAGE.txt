SAVAGE SERIES

The Savage series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium, loess, or in glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine material.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, sedimentary plains and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Belfield, Daglum, Grail and Regent soils.  Belfield, Daglum and Grail are on on similar landscape positions as the Savage soil.  Belfield and Daglum have natric horizons.  Grail soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.  Regent soils are above the Savage soils on the landscape.  They have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Savage soils are used mainly for dryland crops.  Some areas are used for irrigated crops and as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, and perennial forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Savage soils are extensive throughout Montana, western North Dakota and South Dakota.
