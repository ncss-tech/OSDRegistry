SHOTNICK SERIES

The Shotnick series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian deposits over alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Shotnick soils are on alluvial flats, terraces, and hill toeslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shotnick sandy loam, on a east facing, linear-concave, 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 5,280 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine and very fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 9 inches thick)

    C1--8 to 16 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine and many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--16 to 30 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few medium, common fine and many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    C3--30 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive, slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 1.5 miles northwest of Maeser, Utah; located about 1,150 feet north and 2,200 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 7, T. 4 S., R. 21 E.; SLBM; Vernal N.E., Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 28 minutes 50 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 36 minutes 11 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime:  Typic Aridic.
The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that is distributed evenly though the year with a slight increase in late summer and fall. 
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.
Particle-size control section:  5 to 18 percent clay; 0 to 15 percent rock fragments from sandstone and shale

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  LS, SL, FSL
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  SL, FSL
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Geer, Jenrid, and Wentridge series and possibly the Apron, Fang, Fruitland, Ganaflan, Jeddito, Kumiva, Marcou, Mazuma, Moepitz, Piltdown, Sodaspring, Tooele, Trachute, Vanderhoff, and Worland series not yet updated to the Seventh Edition, 1996 keys.
Apron:  hues yellower than 10YR in the C horizon
Fang, Ganaflan, Geer, and Kumiva:  derived from pyroclastic parent material
Jeddito and Jenrid:  stratified layers with textures finer than very fine sandy loam within 40 inches in depth
Marcou and Fruitland:  mean annual soil temperatures greater than 51 degrees F.
Mazuma and Tooele:  exchangeable sodium percentages greater than 15
Moepitz, Vanderhoff, Worland, and Wentridge:  20 to 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact
Piltdown:  have a xeric moisture pattern and formed in pyroclastic parent materials.
Sodaspring:  15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section
Trachute:  secondary gypsum present within the profile

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shotnick soils.
Parent material:  alluvium or eolian deposits over alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.
Landform:  alluvial flats, terraces, and hill toeslopes.
Slopes:  0 to 25 percent
Elevation: 4,700 to 5,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 8 inches.
Frost-free period:  110 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackston, Ioka, Hiko Springs, and Walkup series.
Blackston soils occur on fan remnants and are loamy-skeletal
Ioka soils occur on hill toeslopes and are sandy skeletal.
Walkup soils occur on alluvial flats and have an irrigation induced water table at 40 to 60 inches in depth.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, negligible to medium runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for irrigated cropland, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The potential native plant community is shadscale, galleta, Indian ricegrass, and fourwing saltbush.  This series has been correlated to Desert Sandy Loam (Indian Ricegrass) - 034XY115UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of moderate extent.
