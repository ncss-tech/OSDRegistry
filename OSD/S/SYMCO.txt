SYMCO SERIES

The Symco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed primarily in calcareous loamy till on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Symco loam on a 1 percent slope in a corn field at an elevation of 256 meters (840 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; common roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

   Bt1--20 to 31 cm (8 to 12 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; few roots; many faint brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common fine distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 2 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

   Bt2--31 to 53 cm (12 to 21 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; few roots; many faint reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many medium prominent dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 4 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

   Bt3--53 to 66 cm (21 to 26 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few roots; few faint reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay films in pores; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; few fine prominent dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) iron depletions in the matrix; about 3 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles by volume; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches).]

   C--66 to 152 cm (26 to 60 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay loam; massive; friable; few fine light gray (10YR 7/2) soft accumulations of lime; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; about 4 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

USGS Manawa, Wisconsin topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 28 minutes 35 seconds N., and long. 88 degrees 53 minutes 04 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Thickness of loess or other silty material: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Clay content of the particle-size control section (weighted average):  27 to 35 percent; ranges 20 to 40 percent in individual subhorizons of the argillic horizon
Volume of gravel; 0 to 10 percent in the surface layer; 2 to 15 percent in the subsoil and substratum; mixed lithology but no shale fragments
Volume of cobbles: 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon
Reaction:  slightly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum; neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part; slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the substratum
Calcium carbonate equivalent in the substratum: 15 to 40 percent
Special features: redox features and saturation throughout the soil below the Ap horizon and redox depletions with choma of 2 or less in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon

Ap horizon:

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alida, Ashippun, Kibbie, Lourdes, Marker, and Montmorenci series.   Alida soils do not have carbonates within the series control section. Ashippun soils have shale fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Kibbie soil are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Lourdes soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of less than 15 percent in the till substratum. Marker soils have a densic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Montmorenci soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR in the subsoil and substratum. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Symco soils are on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed primarily in calcareous loamy till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 9.4 degrees C (45 to 49 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are primarily the Hortonville soils and the Angelica, Bonduel, and Tilleda soils.  The well drained Hortonville soils form a drainage sequence with the Symco soils.  In nearby low-lying areas are the poorly drained Angelica soils.  Bonduel soils are nearby where there is limestone bedrock at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). In similar landscapes positions, where the till contains more sand, the Tilleda soils are associates.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) or moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow or moderately slow. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of  31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) for some time in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, or hay.  Some areas are used for pastureland or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous forest. Common trees are American basswood, white ash, red maple, and northern red oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 95A in east-central Wisconsin.  Symco soils are of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Outagamie County, Wisconsin, 1975.

REMARKS:  Symco soils appear to straddle Aquic Argiudolls and Aquollic Hapludalfs depending upon thickness of the mollic surface, dry color of the mollic surface, and depth to the bottom of the argillic horizon.  More pedons can be placed with Aquollic Hapludalfs and this will be the concept.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon -  0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 20 to 53 cm (8 to 21 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3);  Mollic subgroup  Ap horizon with color value and chroma moist of less than 4 and color value, dry, less than 6; Aquic feature  redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon.
