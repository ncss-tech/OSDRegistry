STONEHOUSE SERIES

The Stonehouse series consists of very deep excessively drained soils. They formed in stratified sandy alluvium on flood plain-steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Stonehouse-Eudora, overwash complex- in a cultivated field. (Colors are moist soil unless otherwise stated)

  Ap--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); dark grayish brown 10YR 4/2) loamy sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

  C1--23 to 58 centimeters (9 to 23 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) dry; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary

  C2--58 to 78 centimeters (23 to 31 inches); 60 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand and 40 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) and light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

  C3--78 to 114 centimeters (31 to 45 inches); 99 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3) and 1 percent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand and silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

  C4--114 to 180 centimeters (45 to 71 inches); 60 percent very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and 40 percent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) and light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

  C5--180 to 203 centimeters (71 to 80 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fontaflora, Moundhaven, and Yeager series. 
Fontaflora soils are on narrow to broad flood plains of fast flowing streams of the Southern Appalachian Mountains and piedmont foothills. 
The Moundhaven soils have carbonates to a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches).
The Yeager soils have flakes of mica or coal in the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: stratified sandy alluvium
Landform:  flood plain step
Flooding: occasional to rare
Duration: brief
Months: March to June
Slopes:  0 to 3 percent
Elevation:  244 to 335 meters (800 to 1100 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 11 to 13 degrees C. (52 to 55 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 86 to 102 centimeters (34 to 40 inches)
Precipitation pattern: udic
Frost-free period: 170 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the, Belvue, Bismarckgrove, Bourbonais, Eudora, Kimo, Kiro, and Zeandale soils. 
The Belvue soils are coarse-silty and have carbonates below 51 centimeters (20 inches). 
The Bismarckgrove soils are fine-silty and are somewhat higher on the landscape. 
The Bourbonais soils are coarse-silty over sandy and on similar landscapes. 
The Eudora soils are coarse-silty and are on similar landscapes.
The Kimo soils are clayey over loamy and are in old meanders. 
The Kiro soils are fine and occupy depressions. 
Zeandale soils have carbonates throughout.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage:  Excessively
Runoff: negligible to low 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: very high

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are under cultivation with corn wheat and grain sorghum.
Native vegetation is a thin stand of native grasses and sandburrs or cottonwood and willow trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR M; MLRA 106; the series is of moderate extent.
