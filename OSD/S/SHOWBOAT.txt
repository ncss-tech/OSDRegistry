GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Bohicket, Chowan, Dorovan, Fort Caswell, Fort Fisher, Kureb, Molasses Creek, Newhan, Prices Creek, Sunny Point, Yaupon soils.
Bohicket soils--are on broad level tidal marsh flats bordering the Atlantic Ocean and formed in silty and clayey marine sediments.
Chowan soils--are on riverine floodplains and formed in loamy marine sediments over highly decomposed organic material.
Dorovan soils--on densely forested flood plains, hardwood swamps, and depressions and formed in highly decomposed acid organic materials. 
Fort Caswell soils--are on high-energy submerged wave-cut platforms and shoals formed in sandy estuarine deposits throughout, and do not have hypersulfidic soil materials.
Fort Fisher soils-- are in barrier coves and submerged wave-cut platforms fluctuating from low to high energy formed from sandy over loamy intermixed estuarine deposits and do not have hypersulfidic soil materials.
Kureb soils--are on gently sloping to moderately steep soils on Coastal Plain uplands and side slopes along streams and bays and formed in marine, eolian, or fluvial sands throughout.
Molasses Creek soils--are in estuarine tidal streams and barrier coves and do not have hypersulfidic soil materials.
Newhan soils--are on gently undulating dunes commonly near beaches and waterways formed in sand and shelly eolian deposits along the Atlantic Coast.
Prices Creek soils--are in estuarine tidal streams and mainland coves, formed in fine-loamy estuarine deposits, and do not have hypersulfidic soil materials. 
Sunny Point soils-- are on lower energy shoals and mainland coves and formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and lack buried organic soil materials.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brunswick County, North Carolina, 2024

REMARKS: 
Showboat is derived from the nickname for the USS North Carolina (BB-55). The ship serves as the North Carolina State memorial for World War II and is the most decorated American battleship of World War II. It is anchored as a museum in the Cape Fear River near Wilmington, NC.
