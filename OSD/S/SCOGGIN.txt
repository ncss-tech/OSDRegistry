SCOGGIN SERIES

The Scoggin series consists of very poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy marine sediments on the low Coastal Plain in central Peninsular Florida.  They occur in swamps and low areas bordering swamps.  They are covered with standing water for as much as 6 months in most years beginning in the summer rainy season.  Slope is less than 1 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, subactive, hyperthermic Arenic Endoaquults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Scoggin muck in a forested area.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Oa--0 to 4 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) well decomposed organic matter (muck); weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

     A--4 to 11 inches; black (10YR 2/1) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine and few medium and large roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

     E1--11 to 21 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) sand; single grained; loose; few fine faint black streaks; few fine medium and large roots; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

     E2--21 to 29 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) sand; common medium distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) streaks and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) mottles; single grained; loose; few fine, medium and large roots; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

     E3--29 to 40 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) sand; few medium distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mottles; single grained; loose few fine roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

     Btg--40 to 53 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy clay loam; few coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky; sand grains coated and bridged with clay; few fine decaying roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

     Cg--53 to 58 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) sandy loam; massive; friable; few coarse distinct loamy sand and dark gray sandy clay loam lenses; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Volusia County, Florida; about 4 miles east of Barberville and 0.7 mile east of Plantation Pine Estates along Jack Pine Road.  NW1/4NW1/4 sec. 8, T. 15 S., R. 31 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches.  Soil reaction is extremely acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and very strongly acid to strongly acid in the Oa horizon and the argillic horizon.

The Oa horizon is in hue of 5YR, value 2 or 3, chroma 2 to 4; hue of 10YR, value 2, chroma 1; or hue N, value 2, chroma 0.

The A horizon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  It is sand or fine sand.  The A1 has hue of 10YR or N, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 0.  Thickness ranges from 5 to 14 inches; where the value is 3.5
or less, the thickness is less than 10.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, or N, value 4 to 8, chroma of 2 or 1.  Fine mottles in shades of brown and gray may be present.

The Btg horizon is in hue of 10YR or N, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or less; hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2.  Few to many, fine to coarse, faint to distinct yellowish and brownish mottles may occur.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

The Cg horizon is in hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma 1 or less; hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to fine sand with discontinuous strata of finer or coarser material.

COMPETING SERIES:  No competing series since there are no other soils recognized in the proposed subgroup (Arenic Ochraquults) for the Scoggin soils.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scoggin soils are in swamps and low areas bordering swamps.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation near the type location is about 55 inches with the greater amount coming in summer.  Mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pomona, Riviera, Tomoka, and Wauchula series.  Pomona soils have spodic horizons.  Riviera soils have A2 horizons that tongue into the Bt horizon, which has base saturation greater than 35 percent by sum of cations.  Tomoka soils are organic. Wauchula soils have spodic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Scoggin soils are very poorly drained.  The water table is at or above the surface for as much as 6 months in most years.  Standing water occurs during the summer rainy season.  Permeability is rapid in the A horizons and moderate in the Bt horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in a sparse forest of slash pine and swamp hardwoods with a ground cover of maidencane, pineland threeawn, gallberry, and clumps of sawpalmetto. Some large areas are cleared and artificially drained for use for specialty vegetable crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and southern Florida.  This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Volusia County, Florida; 1977.

REMARKS:

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data is available on a pedon sampled with number S76FL127-27(1-5).  Characterization data was obtained from the University of Florida and engineering test data from the Florida Department of Transportation.  The soil horizon depths were modified on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.  The A2 layers were converted to E horizons.
