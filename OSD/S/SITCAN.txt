MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County Area soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is coined from Smith canyon, a prominent drainage in the area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 15 to 33 inches (38 to 84 cm).  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 inches ( 0 to 38 cm).  (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 33 inches (38 to 84 cm).  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Other features:  Ustic aridic moisture regime
The Sitcan soils were part of the Satanta series, but have been separated based on lower soil moisture, cooler soil temperatures, and the removal of Satanta from MLRA 69.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

10/2008 LAN WAW updated the format to include metric and updated horizon nomenclature during final correlation of Las Animas County soil survey.
