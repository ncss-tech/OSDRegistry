SALTSPRING SERIES

The Saltspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine-loamy alluvium. These nearly level soils are on basin floors and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Saltspring soils are on basin floors and alluvial flats. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed from mixed alluvium. Elevation ranges from 3,900 to 4,040 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the tentative Flake (NM), Corvus (NM) and Yesum (NM) soils. Flake soils lack a salic horizon. Corvus soils have a shallow petrogypsic horizon, Yesum soils have hypergypsic mineralogy.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is fourwing saltbush, desert seepweed, alkali sacaton and iodine bush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin. MLRA 42, Saltspring is of limited extent.
