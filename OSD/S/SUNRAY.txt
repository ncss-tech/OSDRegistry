SUNRAY SERIES

The Sunray Series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping eolian plains or gently sloping draws.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 in) and the mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

Capps and Oslo soils are on slightly lower landscape positions.
Conlen, Kerrick, Plack, Spurlock, and Texline soils are on similar landscape positions.

Darrouzett, Gruver, and Sherm soils are on higher landscape positions and have more than 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderate permeability.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Primarily used for rangeland.  Where cultivated, the principal crops are grain sorghum, small grains, and forage crops.  Climax vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, tobosa, silver bluestem, and prairieclover with a light to moderate overstory of catclaw and yucca.  This soil has been correlated to the Limey Upland (R-077AY006TX) ecological site in MLRA-77A.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A in LRR H) of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and possibly northeastern New Mexico  The series is of moderate extent.
