SUNRAY SERIES

The Sunray Series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level to very gently sloping eolian plains and interfluves.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sherman County, Texas; 1970.

REMARKS:

The original classification of Sunray soils was Fine-loamy, carbonatic, mesic, Calciorthitic Paleustolls.  This older classification scheme allowed for the qualifying argillic horizon to include the hue of 10YR, whereas the current scheme requires 7.5YR or redder.  Some older pedon descriptions of the Sunray series exhibit argillic horizons with hues of 10YR due to this discrepancy.

Major revision to this OSD in 2022 includes returning the series particle-size family to fine-loamy as supported by the predominance of the spatial data, and moving the type location to the original Sunray pedon description used for the establishment of the series in Sherman Co., TX.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
  Mollic epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A horizon)
  Argillic horizon: 25 to 56 cm (10 to 22 in) (Btk1 horizon)
  Secondary carbonates: 25 to 213 cm (10 to 84 in) (Btk and 2Btk horizons)
  Calcic horizon: 56 to 132 cm (22 to 52 in) (Btk2 and Btk3 horizons)
  Lithologic discontinuity: 132 to 213 cm (52 to 84 in) (2Btk1 and 2Btk2 horizons)

Note:  In typical Sunray soil profiles, the upper Btk is the qualifying argillic horizon.  Lower Btk horizons are commonly engulfed with more recent calcium carbonate accumulations and meet the requirements of a calcic horizon; however, they do not qualify as diagnostic argillic horizons.  Lithologic discontinuities are common, but not required to meet series criteria.
