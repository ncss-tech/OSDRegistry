SARITA SERIES

The Sarita series consists of very deep well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in eolian sands over loamy alluvium of Quaternary age. These soils occur on gently undulating, vegetated low dunes on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 cm (25 in) and mean annual air temperature is 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Grossarenic Paleustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Sarita fine sand, 0 to 3 percent slopes in rangeland at an elevation of 70 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    E--20 to 122 cm (8 to 48 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, very friable; few fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. Thickness is 61 to 155 cm (24 to 61 in)

    2Bt1--122 to 132 cm (48 to 52 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; few fine and medium faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium angular blocky; extremely hard, friable; few distinct clay films on surfaces of peds; common fine pores; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 15 to 56 cm (6 to 22 in)

    2Bt3--147 to 203 cm (58 to 80 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; very hard, friable; common faint clay films on vertical surfaces of peds; moderately alkaline.

A few areas are used for irrigated crop production with peanuts, vegetables, and watermelons. The ecological site is Sandy 25-35 PZ (R083EY706TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sandsheet Prairie, Texas; LRR I, MLRA 83E; of southern Texas. The series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Starr County, Texas; 1970.

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series.
These soils were formerly included in the Nueces series.
During the correlation of the Kenedy-Kleberg Soil Survey the A2 was changed to an E horizon based on color and pH.

Edited 11/2013 (RFG-GWH): adjusted the clay content and added LFS in the 2Bt horizon; updated the competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 122 cm (0 to 48 in).
Grossarenic feature: 0 to 122 cm (0 to 48 in). 
Argillic horizon: 122 to 203 cm (48 to 80 in).
