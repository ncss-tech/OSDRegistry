USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses:  Most areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture.
Dominant Vegetation:  Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain sub-estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay. MLRA 149A. This series is of small extent. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2018.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is named for Sand Point, a feature within the Rhode River sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay and were areas formerly included with water. 

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 5 centimeters (Ase horizon)
Peraquic feature-the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters is permanently saturated
Lithologic Discontinuity-pre-Holocene contact (Tertiary aged marine deposits of the Aquia and Nanjemoy formations), the zone from 88 to 200 centimeters (2Cseg1 and 2Cseg2 horizons).
