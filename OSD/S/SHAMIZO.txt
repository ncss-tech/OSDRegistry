SHAMIZO SERIES

The Shamizo series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, thermic Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shamizo extremely stony sand - wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    C1--0 to 5 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely stony sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse roots; many fine through coarse irregular pores; 50 percent stones, 20 percent cobble, 15 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--5 to 13 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely cobbly fine sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse roots; many fine through coarse irregular pores; 5 percent stones, 30 percent cobble, 25 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick)

    C3--13 to 35 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely cobbly fine sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse roots; many very fine through coarse irregular pores; 5 percent stones, 30 percent cobble, 25 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 25 inches thick)

    C4--35 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely stony coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse roots; many fine through coarse irregular pores; 30 percent stones, 15 percent cobble, 40 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Coconino County, Arizona; located about 1,340 feet south and 260 feet east of the NW corner of Section 19; T. 17 N., R. 6 E.; 34 degrees, 50 minutes, 37.9 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees, 46 minutes, 39.4 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-August and December-January.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  59 to 62 degrees

Clay content:  averages 1 to 3 percent in the particle size control section

Rock fragments:  averages 60 to 90 percent, mostly stones and cobble

Reaction:  neutral or slightly alkaline

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 2 percent

Organic matter content: 0.1 to 0.5 percent

C horizons
Hue:  7.5YR, 5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  4 through 6, dry or moist
Texture: fine sand, sand, coarse sand

Some pedons may have lenses of finer material

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Otroizo (AZ) series. Otroizo soils have 45 to 60 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, are strongly acid or slightly acid, and are not subject to flooding.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shamizo soils are on floodplains at elevations of 3,700 to 4,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Vortex and Turist soils.   Vortex soils are very deep and are coarse-loamy.  Turist soils are very shallow and shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; very slow runoff; very rapid permeability.  Shamizo soils are subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes sycamore, cottonwood, and Arizona ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Arizona.  Shamizo soils are of small extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 38.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Yavapai County, Arizona; Soil survey of Black Hills-Sedona Area, Arizona, Parts of Coconino and Yavapai Counties; 1996.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Entisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Eleventh Edition, 2010

When the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the great group of Ustifluvents. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.
