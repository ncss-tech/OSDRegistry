SCORUP SERIES

The Scorup series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks. Scorup soils are on old stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Petrocalcic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Scorup very fine sandy loam-range. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--O to 4 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak thick platy structure that parts to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; few fine pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 9 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to fine subangular blocky and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; few fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    B1--9 to 15 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many roots; many fine and medium pores; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt--15 to 22 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to weak medium subangular blocky; few thin clay films in pores and root channels; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine medium pores; few pebbles and cobbles; slightly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    B2--22 to 31 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bkm1--31 to 44 inches; pinkish white (5YR 8/2) cobbly light clay loam, pink (5YR 7/3) moist; massive; weakly cemented; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent cobbles and pebbles; very strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 20 inches thick)

    Bkm2--44 to 56 inches; indurated lime-cemented hardpan.

TYPE LOCATION:  San Juan County, Utah; 1.45 miles west of LaSal livestock store, north cutbank in the NE1/4 of section 4. T.295., R.24E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Mollic epipedon thickness: 7 to 10 inches

Solum thickness: 15 to 25 inches

Depth to the indurated hardpan: 36 to 50 inches

Hardpan thickness: 2 to 15 inches thick

Rock fragments: 0 to 25 percent

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 degrees to 49 degrees F.

Soil moisture: Aridic ustic moisture regime

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry
Rock fragments: 0 to 25 percent
Texture: dominantly very fine sandy loam or cobbly very fine sandy loam but ranges to light loam that is high in very fine sand and fine sand.
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Thickness: 7 to 10 inches

Bt horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: dominantly heavy very fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam
Thickness: 9 to 15 inches

Bk horizon
Value: 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Rock fragments: 10 to 35 percent
Texture: cobbly sandy clay loam to gravelly loam, sandy clay loam or very fine sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Tajo (AZ) series.  Tajo soils have clay loam argillic horizons and have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scorup soils are on alluvial fans and old stream terraces at elevations of 6,200 to 7,000 feet. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 6 percent but range up to 25 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks and some eolian deposits.  The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees to 48 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ackmen, Monticello, and Northdale soils. All of these soils lack cemented hardpans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability above the hardpan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for range and irrigated cropland. Crops are mainly small grains, alfalfa and pasture.  The natural vegetation is dominantly western wheatgrass, big sagebrush, and widely spaced juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Utah. This series is inextensive.
