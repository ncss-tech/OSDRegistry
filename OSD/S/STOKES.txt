STOKES SERIES

The Stokes series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Stokes soils are on low lake terraces and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Payson series.  Payson soils have ochric epipedons 2 to 6 inches thick and have calcic horizons at depths of 9 to 13 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stokes soils occur on low lake terraces and lake plains. They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources, the surface of which may have been reworked by wind and water.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,270 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Airport, Greenson, and Lasil soils.  Airport soils are fine-silty and have mollic epipedons.  Greenson soils are fine-silty, have mollic epipedons, and do not have natric horizons.  Lasil soils are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3.5 and 5 feet (deep free water occurrence class) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Stokes soils are used mostly for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland and some rangeland.  The native vegetation in rangeland is mainly black greasewood, Wyoming big sagebrush, Nuttall's saltbush, annual mustard, prickly lettuce, and other annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 5,400 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Box Elder County (Eastern Part), Utah, 1969.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 11 inches (Ap and A horizons).

Natric horizon - The zone from 11 to 24 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 18 to 47 inches (Btkn and Bkn horizons).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 42 and 60 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bkn and C horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 11 to 24 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons).


The revision of April 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Fine, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Natrixeralfs based on the depth to the seasonal high saturation of more than 30 inches.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 214-215, Table 9 of the Soil Survey of Box Elder County, Utah, Eastern Part.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.
