SUEPERT SERIES

The Suepert series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a hardpan, that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Suepert extremely stony silt loam - on a north facing slope of 10 percent under rangeland vegetation at 3,750 feet elevation.  When described on June 5, 1980, the soil profile was slightly moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely stony silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--8 to 18 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 19 inches thick)

    Bw2--18 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 50 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

    Bkqm--32 to 48 inches; white (10YR 8/2) very cobbly indurated duripan, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; thin (1/16 to 1/8 inch thick) continuous, fractured laminar opal cap; fractures are 1/4 to 1 inch wide and more than 10 inches apart; violent effervescence; gradual wavy boundary.  (14 to 28 inches thick)

    C--48 to 80 inches; lime coated sand, gravel, cobbles, and stones.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jerome County, Idaho; about 9 miles west of Eden, southwest 1/4, northeast 1/4, southwest 1/4, section 26, T. 9 S., R. 18 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to duripan - 20 to 40 inches
Average clay content in control section - 15 to 25 percent
Average annual soil temperature - 52 to 54 degrees F.
Depth to sand and gravel - 34 to more than 60 inches
Depth to bedrock - more than 60 inches

A horizon
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist
Structure - granular or platy
Gravel - 5 to 20 percent
Cobbles - 40 to 45 percent
Stones - 15 to 20 percent

Bw horizon (not to include Bkqm)
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4
Texture - CBV-L, CBV-SIL, CBX-SIL, CBX-L
Gravel - 10 to 15 percent
Cobbles - 30 to 50 percent
Stones - 10 to 15 percent

Bkqm horizon
Thickness of the duripan - 14 to 28 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Bannion (T) and Coonskin (T) series.  Bannion soils are moderately or strongly alkaline in the Bw and Bk horizons, and have a calcic above the duripan.  Coonskin soils have secondary carbonates above the duripan at depths of 5 to 15 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Suepert soils are on terraces.  The slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 10 inches.  The average annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Banbury, Paulville, and Taunton soils.  Banbury, Paulville, and Taunton soils occur on lower terraces.  Banbury soils are shallow to bedrock.  Paulville soils are deep.  Taunton soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Suepert soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is Sandberg bluegrass, Nevada bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Suepert soils are of small extent in south-central Idaho.
