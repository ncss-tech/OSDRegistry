SPRINGER SERIES

The Springer series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments and alluvium. These nearly level to hummocky soils are on interdunes and dunes of sand sheets on stream terraces alluvial plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and cropland; Cotton, sorghum, peanuts, and winter wheat are the main crops. Native vegetation is mostly little bluestem, sand bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, sideoats grama, and sand lovegrass. Sand sage and Chickasaw plum are the woody plants. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR H; Central Rolling Red Plains of Texas and Oklahoma; MLRA 78B & 78C. The series is extensive.
