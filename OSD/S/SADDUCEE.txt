SADDUCEE SERIES

The Sadducee series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in lacustrine sediments. These soils are on lake backswamps and low relief beaches and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fulmer and Roliss series. Fulmer soils formed in alluvium and are poorly drained. Roliss soils formed in till and are in a 19 to 27 inch precipitation zone. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: lake backswamps and low relief beaches 
Elevation: 5,900 to 6,000 feet 
Slope: 0 to 2 percent 
Parent material: lacustrine sediments 
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers 
Average annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches 
Average annual temperature: 41 to 45 degrees F. 
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The  North Beach series is sandy-skeletal over loamy with 40 to 85 percent rock fragments in the upper 20 to 30 inches of the soil profile and somewhat poorly drained. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; negligible to low surface runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for hayland or pasture. Native vegetation is mainly reeds, sedges, rushes, cattails, willow, and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sadducee soils are of small extent in southern Idaho along the west beach of Bear Lake. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.
