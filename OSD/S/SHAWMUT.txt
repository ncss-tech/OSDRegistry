SHAWMUT SERIES 

The Shawmut series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium, glaciofluvial deposits, colluvium, or till.  These soils are on plains, alluvial fans, stream terraces, escarpments, hills, mountains, and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 22 inches. 
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearpaw, Roy, Williams, and the competing Hilger soils. Bearpaw and Williams soils are on till plains and contain less than 35 percent rock fragments. Roy soils are clayey-skeletal and on similar landform positions. Hilger soils are on fans and footslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Shawmut soils are mainly used for rangeland and dryland crops.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, green needlegrass, prairie junegrass, needleandthread, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Shawmut soils are extensive mainly in the central part of Montana. MLRAs 43B, 44B, and 46.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0287, MT0747, MT8034, MT8042, MT1066.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A, Bt1, Bt2 horizons);
Argillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 15 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons);
Particle-size control section - the zone from 3 to 15 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons).  

Shawmut soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
