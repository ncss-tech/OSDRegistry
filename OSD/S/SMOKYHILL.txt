SMOKYHILL SERIES

The Smokyhill series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on high flood plains.  They formed in clayey over lighter colored silty alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 74 centimeters (29 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Smokyhill silt loam - cultivated (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots throughout; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  A--15 to 36 centimeters (6 to 14 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined A horizons are 20 to 66 centimeters (8 to 26 inches) thick)

  AC--36 to 76 centimeters (14 to 30 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots throughout; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (15 to 46 centimeters (6 to 18 inches) thick)

  2C--76 to 183 centimeters (30 to 72 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Geary County, Kansas; about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) west and 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of Junction City; 792 meters (2,600 feet) south and 457 meters (1,500 feet) east of the northwest corner of section 33, T. 12 S., R. 5 E.  USGS topographic quadrangle, Kansas Falls, Kansas; latitude 38 degrees, 57 minutes, 53 seconds north; longitude 96 degrees, 53 minutes, 6 seconds west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mollic epipedon: 51 to 86 centimeters (20 to 34 inches)
Depth to the 2C horizon: 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches)
Free carbonates: throughout profile

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 or 4, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: lower part of the A horizon averages 30 to 40 percent clay
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline.

AC horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silty clay loam or silty clay averaging 35 to 45 percent clay
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline
Some pedons have a Bw horizon.

2C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam or very fine sandy loam averaging 10 to 18 percent clay  
Thin strata of finer or coarser sediments occur in some pedons.
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: drainageways and depressions on high floodplains of major streams
Slopes: dominantly less than 1 percent and generally concave
Parent material: clayey alluvium over lighter colored silty alluvium
Mean annual precipitation: 66 to 81 centimeters (26 to 32 inches)
Thornthwaites P-E Index: 44 to 54
Mean annual air temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 58 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the McCook soils.  
McCook soils are coarse-silty and are on the same flood plain levels but in a slightly higher position.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage:  moderately well drained
Runoff: negligible  
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high in upper part and moderately high in lower part
Flooding: occasional

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated.  
Principal crops are wheat and grain sorghum.  
Native vegetation was tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Kansas.  The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Geary County, Kansas, 1991.  The name is coined from the Smoky Hill River in Geary County.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 76 centimeters (0 to 30 inches) (Ap, A, and AC horizons)  

These soils were formally mapped as Sutphen soils or considered as inclusions in McCook soils.
06/2003 CEC activity class added, format changed to semi-tabular

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Kansas State University Soil Characterization Laboratory sample numbers 2430-2433 (pedon 89KS061070) from the type location.

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
