SPELVIN SERIES 

The Spelvin series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in eolian over alluvium. These soils are on interdunes on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 74 centimeters (29 inches) and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C. (56 degrees F.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Nickerson and Zellmont series.  Nickerson soils are moderately well drained and have a seasonally high water table. Zellmont soils are moderately deep to shale.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: eolian over alluvial sediments
Landform: interdunes on paleo-terraces
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent
Elevation: 500 to 600 meters (1640 to 2000 feet)
Wettest months: Mar.- Oct.
Driest months: Nov.- Feb.
Frost-free period: 187 to 225 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hayes, Langdon, Solvay, Tivin and Turon series. 
Hayes soils are well drained, coarse-loamy and on dunes, and have a buried soil at depths of 76 to 203 centimeters (30 to 80 inches).  Langdon soils are somewhat excessively drained sandy soils on steep dunes. Tivin soils are somewhat excessively drained on dunes on paleo-terraces.  Solvay soils are somewhat poorly drained, fine-loamy, in lower positions between dunes, and have a seasonal high water table.  The well drained, sandy Turon soils are on dunes, and have a buried soil at depths of 102 to 203 centimeters (40 to 80 inches). 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: very low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderate ly high

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cultivation. Wheat and grain sorghum are the principal crops. Some areas are used for pasture or range. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas, LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is of small extent.
