TYPE LOCATION: Western Kenai Peninsula Area, Alaska; about 5 miles northeast of Homer, Alaska; in the 100 feet west and 2,000 feet south of the NE 1/4, section 1, T. 6 s., R. 13 3.; Seldovia C-5 NE 1:25,000 quad, Seward Meridian; UTM north 6617370 and UTM east 590080, zone 5, NAD 27 Alaska.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture regime: udic
Mean annual soil temperature: about 34 degrees F
Depth to redoximorphic features: 20 to 30 inches
Soil profile: above 40 inches are saturated for short periods of time during the growing season

O horizon:
Matrix color; value of 2 or 3; chroma of 1 to 3
Reaction: very strongly acid or strongly acid

A horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Coarse fragment content: 0 to 10
Reaction: moderately acid or slightly acid

C or Cg horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 2 or 3
Redoximorphic features: size, color and abundance are variable

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: somewhat poorly drained
Parent material: stratified alluvium and/or colluvium
Landform: alluvial fans
Slopes: 0 to 15 percent
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 37 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 24 to 30 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Beluga and Starichkof soils. Beluga and Starichkof soils are very poorly drained and occur on depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, medium to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for home sites, pasture, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is bluejoint reed grass, alder, elderberry, and other shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowland, South-central Alaska. The series is of small extent.
