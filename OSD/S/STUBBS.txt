STUBBS SERIES

The Stubbs series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over material weathered from sedimentary rock. Stubbs soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean air annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Stubbs loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    AB--6 to 16 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--16 to 20 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--20 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt1, Bt2 horizons - 6 to 24 inches)

    Btk--30 to 34 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; common soft masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 19 inches thick)

    Cr--34 to 60 inches; weakly calcareous, soft shale and siltstone.
