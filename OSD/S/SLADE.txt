SLADE SERIES

The Slade series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy till on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are Crossett, Elcajon, and Peshtigo series. Crossett soils are deeper than 89 cm (35 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Elcajon soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Peshtigo soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 71 cm (28 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Slade soils are on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Slade soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 80 to 110 days. Elevation is 183 to 412 meters (600 to 1,350 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Angelica, Bamfield, Morganlake, and Ossineke soils. The Bamfield soils are well drained and are on slopes greater than 12 percent. The Morganlake and Ossineke soils are on a slightly higher landscape position and are moderately well drained. In addition the Morganlake soils have a sandy surface mantle. The Angelica soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained, do not have an argillic horizon, and are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 76 cm (0.5 to 2.5 feet) between September and December and between April and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas of Slade are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland. Some areas are in woodland. Native vegetation is a northern hardwood forest. Common trees are sugar maple, American beech, American basswood, yellow birch, red maple, white spruce, eastern hemlock, quaking aspen and American elm.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northern half of Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
