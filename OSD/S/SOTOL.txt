SOTOL SERIES

The Sotol series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium from monzonite.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Colluvium from monzonite
Landform: Mountain flanks and bases
Slope: 15 to 35 percent
Mean annual temperature: 58 to 61 degrees
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 15 inches
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 140 to 180 days
Elevation: 4,700 to 6,300 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rotagilla and Poblano soils.  
Rotagilla soils are shallow to bedrock and are on mountain tops and flanks.
Poblano soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches and are on mountain flanks and bases.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is very high .

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is of the montane shrubland type consisting of sideoats grama, blue grama, green sprangletop, hairy grama, sotol, catclaw acacia, broom snakeweed, alligator juniper, and shrub live-oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 3 to 18 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 18 inches. (A, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Argillic horizon: The zone from 3 to 18 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Aridic feature: an ustic moisture that borders on the aridic moisture regime.

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
