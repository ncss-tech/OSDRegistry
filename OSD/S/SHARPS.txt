SHARPS SERIES

The Sharps series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone overlaying shale.  Sharps soils are on mesas, ridges, and hills. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Sharps loam, in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    BA--6 to 9 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films in root channels; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--9 to 19 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 32 inches thick)

    Bk1--19 to 25 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; common calcium carbonate threads and soft masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk2--25 to 30 inches; pink (5YR 8/4) loam, pink (5YR 7/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many soft masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 28 inches thick)

    2Cr--30 inches; shale and soft sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Altega, Amal, Buick, Chita, Elpedro, Keiser, Klinedraw, Moncha, Oshoto, Pulpit, Roubideau, Verde, Wetherill, and Wiley series. Altega, Amal, Buick, Chita, Elpedro, Keiser, Moncha, Oshoto, Wetherill, and Wiley soils are very deep. Klinedraw soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y. Pulpit, Roubideau, and Verde soils are moderately deep over hard sandstone. In addition, Roubideau soils lack carbonates in the lower part of the solum, and Verde soils have a fragipan-like horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian material derived from sandstone and shale.
Landform: mesas, ridges, and hills
Slopes: 2 to 12 percent
Elevation: 6,200 to 7,400 feet
Mean annual temperature: 46 to 50 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cahona, Pulpit, and Wetherill series.  All these soils are on the same landscape position as Sharps.  Cahona soils have a calcic horizon. Wetherill soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, low to high runoff, moderate and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Sharps soils are used for grazing or as irrigated or dry cropland.  Native vegetation is mainly sagebrush, cactus, pinyon, juniper, western wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado and New Mexico.  LRR D, MLRA 35, 36 and 39.  This series is of moderate extent.
