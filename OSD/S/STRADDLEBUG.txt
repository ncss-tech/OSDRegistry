STRADDLEBUG SERIES

The Straddlebug series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on broad alluvial flats and floodplains.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Straddlebug soils are on broad alluvial flats and floodplains.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring in the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation is 3,500 to 5,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Borunda, Butcherknife, and Gemelo soils.  Borunda soils are moderately deep to tuffaceous bedrock, and have calcic and gypsic horizons.  They are on convex erosional uplands.  Butcherknife soils have calcic and gypsic horizons, and are in the fine family.  They are on broad alluvial flats.   Gemelo soils are in the coarse-loamy family, and are on alluvial fan aprons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is low  on 0 to 1 percent slopes, and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used as livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Woody species include tarbush, creosotebush, and mesquite.  Grasses include tobosagrass, blue grama, black grama, sideoats grama, bush muhly, burrograss, plains bristlegrass, Arizona cottontop, alkali sacaton, and cane bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Texas. MLRA 42. The series is moderately extensive.
