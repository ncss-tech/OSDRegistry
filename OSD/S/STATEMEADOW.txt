STATEMEADOW SERIES

The Statemeadow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in reworked loess and material from basalt with a mantle of mixed loess and volcanic ash. They are on hills and terraces on plateaus. Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Lynchlake (MT) - have a horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Statemeadow soils are on hills and terraces on plateaus at elevations of 1,600 to 3,800 feet. These soils formed reworked loess and material from basalt with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash. The slope range is 5 to 40 percent. The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 45 inches and the frost free season is 50 to 110 days (9 in 10 years to 1 in 10 years, respectively).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grangemont, Kauder and the Reggear series. Grangemont and Kauder soils are on similar positions and have 7 to 14 inches of volcanic ash on the surface. In addition, Kauder soils have a fragipan at 20 to 40 inches. Reggear soils are on similar positions and have a fragipan at 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is medium and permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and watershed. Potential native vegetation is grand fir, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, goldthread, starry false Solomons seal and common beargrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho; Statemeadow soils are not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
