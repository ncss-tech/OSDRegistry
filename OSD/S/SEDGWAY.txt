SEDGWAY SERIES

The Sedgway series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  They are on mountain slopes and foothills.  They formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks with some loess influence in the upper part.  Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and the average annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pando series.  Pando soils have the base of the argillic horizon and depth to sandy-skeletal material at 50 to 100 cm and have 8 to 18 percent clay in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sedgway soils are on slightly convex to concave mountain slopes and foothills at elevations of 1830 to 2590 meters.  Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks with some loess influence in the upper part.  The average annual temperature ranges from 2 to 5 degrees C and the average annual precipitation ranges from 560 to 760 millimeters.  The frost-free season is less than 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beaverdam, Cedarhill, Greys, Harkness, Ireland, Mikesell, and Toponce series.  Beaverdam soils have fine particle-size control sections.  Cedarhill and Ireland soils have calcic horizons and frigid temperature regimes.  Greys soils are fine-silty.  Harkness and Mikesell soils lack mollic epipedons.  Toponce soils are pachic and have fine particle-size control sections.  The Beaverdam soil is on mountain slopes but usually occupies a more concave position lower on the slope.  The Cedarhill and Ireland soils are on south or west aspects on mountain slopes.  The Greys and Toponce soils are at lower elevations on mountain footslopes of less than 30 percent.  The Harkness and Mikesell soils are on mountain slopes at higher elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is medium to very rapid; permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This Sedgway soil is used mainly for timber production and grazing.  The principal native plants at climax are an overstory of Douglas-fir with an understory dominated by pine reedgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  This series is not extensive.
