SHEEPSKIN SERIES

The Sheepskin series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in coarse and moderately coarse alluvium.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Sheepskin soils are on stream and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Torrifluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sheepskin gravelly loamy sand, in a weedy pivot corner with a southeast facing slope of 4 percent at 4,445 feet elevation.  (When described on November 10, 1993 the soil was dry from 0 to 3 inches and slightly moist below.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cleman, Kimberly, and Mosida series.  Cleman and Kimberly soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and they are well drained.  Mosida soils appear to be misclassified and are too poorly defined to compete.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sheepskin soils are on stream and fan terraces with slopes from 0 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,400 to 4,500 feet.  The soil formed in mixed coarse and moderately coarse alluvium.  The climate is semi-arid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kukvey (T), Quincy, Shoban (T), Tickason, and Tindahay soils.  Kukvey soils are on stream and fan terraces and are sandy throughout.  Quincy soils are on dunes and terraces, have an ochric epipedon and are sandy throughout.  Shoban soils are on stream terraces and have a water table at a depth of 24 to 40 inches during May through November.  Tickason soils are on stream terraces and have a calcic horizon at a depth of 12 to 23 inches.  Tindahay soils are on stream terraces and have a sandy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very slow or slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sheepskin soils are used primarily for irrigated cropland.  They are also used for homesites and rangeland.  The major crops grown are potatoes, wheat, barley, and alfalfa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES PROPOSED:  Bingham County, Idaho, 1993.  The name is taken from Sheepskin Road in the Fort Hall Indian Reservation.

REMARKS:  Most areas of the Sheepskin series were mapped as the Tindahay series in the Fort Hall Area Soil Survey, 1977.  The Sheepskin Soils are being differentiated by having a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 12 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)

Torrifluventic subgroup - Sheepskin soils occur within an area with an aridic moisture regime that is bordering on xeric.  The soil is assumed to have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth based on stratification of texture and soil color within the profile.

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Ap2 horizon, the Bw1, Bw2, and C1 horizons, and part of the C2 horizon)
