COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Biscayne (FL) and Cudjoe (FL) series.
Biscayne soils are from fresh water deposits, have greater than 15 percent rock fragments, are not flooded, and occur on similar landform positions on the southern Florida Peninsula.
Cudjoe soils occur in the tidal zone, are very frequently flooded, and occur on slightly lower landform positions. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): marine marshes, swamps, and low broad flats on the Islands of Key West
Parent material: calcareous silty marl sediments from marine water over oolitic limestone bedrock
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 27 degrees C (73 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1570 millimeters (37 to 62 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Cudjoe and Lignumvitae soils occur in the tidal zone with mangroves and are subject to very frequent flooding.
Islamorada, Keylargo, and Tavernier soils have sapric organic control sections, occur in the tidal zone with mangroves, are very frequently flooded, and occur on lower landform positions.
Keyvaca soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments, have bedrock at depths less than 15 centimeters (6 inches), are better drained, and occur on higher landform positions.
Keywest soils are stratified with sapric organic material and calcareous silty marl sediments, occur in the tidal zone with mangroves, are very frequently flooded, and occur on lower landform positions.
Matecumbe soils have sapric organic muck over bedrock, have bedrock at depths of less than 23 centimeters (9 inches), and occur on higher landform positions.
Pennekamp soils have less than 45 percent silt fraction, have sapric organic surfaces, are better drained, and occur on higher landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage class: Very Poorly drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Moderately high to high
Runoff: High
Depth to seasonal high-water table: 15 to 46 centimeters (6 to 18 inches)
Flooding frequency and duration: rare to frequent flooding with brief duration caused by storm surges and hurricanes
