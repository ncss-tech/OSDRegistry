SUPPLYMINE SERIES

The Supplymine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from gneissic and granitoid rock. Supplymine soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chemehuevi (CA), Gunsight (AZ) and Heleweiser (NV) series. Chemehuevi, Gunsight and Heleweiser soils are greater than 150 centimeters to a lithic contact and are formed in alluvial parent material. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Supplymine soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from gneissic or granitoid rock. Elevations range from 340 to 850 meters (1,115 to 2,788 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackeagle, Bolero, Dalelake and Ironage soils. Blackeagle, Bolero and Ironage are on similar landscape positions, and Dalelake soils are on sandsheets adjacent to or partially covering lower mountain slopes. Blackeagle, Bolero and Ironage soils are shallow to a lithic contact. In addition, Blackeagle soils have a cambic horizon, Ironage soils have an argillic horizon and Bolero soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Dalelake soils have sandy particle-size control sections and are formed in eolian materials. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the bedrock and low saturated hydraulic conductivity within the bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Supplymine soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush, brittlebush and burrobush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
