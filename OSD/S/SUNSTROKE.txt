SUNSTROKE SERIES

The Sunstroke series consists of moderately deep over hardpan, somewhat excessively drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils are formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Sunstroke extremely gravelly sandy loam - recreation land. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 65 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 18 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 70 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk--18 to 24 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 70 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, few calcium carbonate threads on ped faces; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 20 inches thick)

    Bkqm--24 to 45 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) indurated hardpan.

    2R--45 inches; fanglomerate.

TYPE LOCATION: Hualapai Wash, Mohave County, Arizona; Latitude of 35 degrees, 56 minutes, 59 seconds North, and a longitude of 114 degrees, 8 minutes, 52 seconds West.  1,800 feet east and 1,000 feet south of the northwest corner of section 31, T. 30 N., R. 17 W. Gila and Salt River Base Meridian.

Soil temperature:  59 to 72 degrees F.

Rock fragments:  35 to 75 percent

Depth to hardpan:  20 to 40 inches

Depth to bedrock:  30 to 60 inches

Organic matter content:  less than 1 percent in the surface

Reaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline

A horizon

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Value: 5 or 6, dry or moist

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist


Bw and Bk horizons

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Value: 5 or 6, dry or moist

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Shorim (NV) and Skelon (NV) series.  Shorim soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods of time due to a lower rainfall component of 3 to 5 inches.  Skelon soils have a thick hardpan overlying unconsolidated alluvium.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sunstroke soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 1,600 to 2,700 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo, Bluebird, Deluge, Detrital, Gotchell, Hulda, and Nickel soils.  Arizo, Bluebird, Detrital, and Nickel soils are very deep.  Gotchel soils are shallow or very shallow to a hardpan overlying bedrock.  Hulda soils are very shallow or shallow over bedrock.  Deluge soils are moderately deep to a hardpan overlying bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow to high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Sunstroke soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Vegetation includes creosotebush, white bursage, buckhorn cholla and Mohave yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of minor extent.  MLRA is 30.
