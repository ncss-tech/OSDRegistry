SELTI SERIES

The Selti series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from monzonite and quartzite.  Selti soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calciargidic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Selti very stony coarse sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is partially covered with 15 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles, and 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--10 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots, common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on peds; 10 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, and 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt2--30 to 76 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films bridging sand grains; 15 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 64 cm thick)

    Bk1--76 to 132 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely stony loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; few medium masses of soft carbonate; 30 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 30 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (38 to 76 cm thick)

    Bk2--132 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely stony loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; few fine carbonate filaments; bottom of rock fragments coated with soft carbonate; 30 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 30 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2)

TYPE LOCATION:  White Pine County, Nevada; about 12 miles southwest of Schellbourne Station; 2,640 feet east and 1,320 feet north of the projected southwest corner of section 27, T. 21 N., R. 63 E.; USGS Monte Neva Hot Springs 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 39 minutes 15 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 50 minutes 20 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal 39.6541667 latitude, -114.8388889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and early spring, dry in summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 70 to 100 cm.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 23 to 46 cm.  When mixed, the upper 18 cm has value of less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist and chroma of 3 or less moist.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: 40 to 60 percent.

A horizon
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.

Bt horizons
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Texture: Very cobbly sandy clay loam or very cobbly sandy loam.

Bk horizons - Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Rock fragments: 60 to 85 percent, 20 to 30 percent stones, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, 25 to 35 percent gravel.  Approximately 1/3 of gravel are 2 to 5 mm in diameter. 
Secondary carbonates: From few fine carbonate filaments to common medium soft carbonate masses.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Belmill, Kancan, Mountainville, Pagari, Povertyflat and Red Butte series.  

Belmill soils have accumulations of silica and are less than 50 cm deep to the calcic horizon.  Kancan soils have secondary lime accumulation at 23 to 70 cm deep.  Mountainville, Pagari and Red Butte soils have mollic epipedons that do not extend into the argillic horizon.  In addition, Mountainville and Red Butte soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in argillic horizon.  Pagari soils have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and bedrock at 100 to 150 cm. Selti soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Selti series are on fan piedmont remnants. These soils are formed in alluvium derived from monzonite and quartzite.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,890 to 2,200 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Belmill, Urmafot and Wredah series.  Belmill soils are in the same family, but lack cobbles and stones in the particle-size control section and are 28 to 50 cm deep to the calcic horizon.  Urmafot soils lack an argillic horizon and are less than 50 cm deep to a duripan.  Wredah soils are in a fine-loamy family and have 2Ckq horizons with weak cementation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass Thurber's needlegrass with scattered singleleaf pinyon and juniper trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  These soils are of small extent. MLRA 28B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  White Pine County, Nevada, 1981.

REMARKS:  The name is from the nearby Selvi ranch.  This soil was re-classified in 1988 to better reflect series concepts.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A and Bt1 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from about 10 to 76 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from about 76 to 152 cm (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).
Aridic feature - Aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Particle-size control section - The zone from about 10 to 61 cm (Bt1 and part of Bt2 horizons).
