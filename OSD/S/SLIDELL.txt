SLIDELL SERIES

The Slidell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey sediments.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on base slopes of ridges on hills.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in).  Mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Slidell clay--pastureland (At center of microdepression).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: calcareous clayey slope alluvium and/or residuum derived from clayey marl and shale of lower Cretaceous age

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Sanger series and the Bolar, Crawford, Denton, San Saba, and Somervell series.
Bolar, Crawford, San Saba, and Somervell soils: are moderately deep, 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in), to limestone bedrock and occur on higher positions
Denton soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section, have carbonatic mineralogy, and occur on slightly higher positions
Sanger soils: occur on slightly higher positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is high on slopes of less than 1 percent and very high on 1 to 5 percent slopes. Water enters rapidly when the soil is dry and cracked, and very slowly when the soil is moist.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cropland, pasture, and range.  Main crops are cotton, small grain, corn and grain sorghum.  Pastures are mainly common and coastal bermudagrass.  Native vegetation consists of bluestems, sideoats grama, buffalograss, and Texas wintergrass.  Scattered mesquite, elm, and hackberry trees are in some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Texas; Land Resource Region J, MLRA 85 (Grand Prairie). The series is extensive.
