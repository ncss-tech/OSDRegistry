SWINGSTATION SERIES

The Swingstation series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on hillslopes, fan aprons and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Swingstation loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A--0 to 6 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many fine interstitial pores; finely disseminated carbonate in matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 cm thick)                                                        

     Btk--6 to 48 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots throughout; many fine tubular pores; 10 percent clay films on surfaces along root channels; 14 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; 5 percent paragravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

     Btky--48 to 95 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; many fine tubular pores; 10 percent clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; and 10 percent irregular gypsum crystals in matrix; 10 percent paragravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)                                                      

     BCky--95 to 150 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) paragravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), moist; massive; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; 10 percent irregular gypsum crystals in matrix; 30 percent paragravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
