SCIOTO SERIES

The Scioto series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in poorly sorted outwash. These soils are on outwash terraces, eskers, kames, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Scioto silt loam, on a 1 percent slope in wheat at an elevation of 276 meters (904 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bt1--25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and very fine roots; many faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) and common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on vertical faces of peds; 8 percent limestone gravel; 2 percent limestone cobbles; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 38 cm (5 to 15 inches) thick]

 2Bt2--41 to 71 cm (16 to 28 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly silty clay loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and very fine roots; many distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent soft limestone around rock fragments; 40 percent limestone cobbles; 25 percent limestone gravel; 2 percent limestone stones; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual irregular boundary.

 2Bt3--71 to 129 cm (28 to 51 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly silt loam and loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and very fine roots; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 50 percent limestone cobbles; 20 percent limestone gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon is 51 to 114 cm 20 to 45 inches).]

 2C--129 to 203 cm (51 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely stony coarse sandy loam; massive; friable; few very fine roots; some pockets of loam; few distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on sand grains and rock fragments; 40 percent limestone stones; 20 percent limestone cobbles; 15 percent limestone gravel; 5 percent other rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Delaware County, Ohio; about 3 miles south-southwest of Radnor, in Radnor Township; 560 feet south and 340 feet west of the intersection of River Rd. and Mink Street Rd.; USGS Ostrander, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 22 minutes 52.9 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 10 minutes 45.0 seconds W., NAD 27. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the base of the ochric epipedon: 13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 inches)
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 89 to 152 cm (35 to 60 inches)
Thickness of the solum: 89 to 152 cm (35 to 60 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 25 to 114 cm (10 to 45 inches)
Depth to horizons containing more than 35 percent limestone fragments: 30 to 51 cm (12 to 20 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 25 to 35 percent clay

Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: silty clay loam, clay, silty clay, or clay loam
Rock fragment content: 5 to 14 percent

2C horizon:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Benthole and Bloomsdale series. Benthole soils have more than 14 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Bloomsdale soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 114 cm (45 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scioto soils are on treads and risers on outwash terraces and stream terraces and on summits and shoulders on eskers and kames of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in poorly sorted outwash. Rock fragments are mainly limestone of gravel, cobble, and stone sizes. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 79 to 1067 mm (31 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glynwood, Leoni, Lybrand, Martinsville, Milton, and Rossburg soils. Leoni soils have less rock fragments and are on steep side slopes of adjacent eskers and kames. The Lybrand and moderately well drained Glynwood soils have more clay in the control section and are on adjacent slightly higher dissected till plains. Milton soils are moderately deep to limestone bedrock and are on adjacent slightly higher dissected till plains. Rossburg soils have mollic epipedons and are on adjacent flood plains. Martinsville soils have less rock fragments and are on treads on outwash terraces and summits on ground moraines.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the subsoil and high in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the upper part of the subsoil and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and small grains are the principal crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and western Ohio; MLRA 111B. The series is of small extent, with about 3,000 acres.
