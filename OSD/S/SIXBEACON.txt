SIXBEACON SERIES 

The Sixbeacon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sixbeacon gravelly loam, irrigated hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick) 

    Bw--4 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bk1--10 to 12 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick) 

    2Bk2--12 to 24 inches; white (10YR 8/2) very gravelly sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; 50 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 23 inches thick) 

    3Bk3--24 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 60 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0618, MT8150.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (A, Bw horizons); a calcic horizon from 12 to 60 inches (2Bk2, 3Bk3 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, 2Bk2, 3Bk3 horizons).  Sixbeacon soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
