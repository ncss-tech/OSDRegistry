SANLUIS SERIES

The Sanluis series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable) soils that formed in eolian beach sands. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on foredunes on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (68 70 degrees F).

SERIES PROPOSED: Galveston County, Texas, 2020. The name is a derivative of San Luis Pass.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Galveston series. The series was separated based on differences in water table depth, vegetation, and landform.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 22 cm (0 to 9 in) (A horizon) 
Endosaturation: 146 to 203 cm (58 to 80 in) (Cg1 and Cg2 horizons)

Additional Comments: None

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL Data from a representative location S2002TX039001 (lab pedon number 03N0165) which was part of a mineralogy study of selective sandy soils of barrier islands and strand plains. MLRA Soil Survey Office data are available on location S2019TX1677070 at the series type location.
