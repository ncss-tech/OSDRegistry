SHAMOCK SERIES

The Shamock series consists of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that are on fan remnants, alluvial plains and relict alluvial flats. Shamock soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON: Shamock gravelly fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 40 percent pebbles overlain by a 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick mantle of windblown sand.

(5 to 18 inches thick) 

	Bqk--21 to 37 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial pores; 20 percent pebbles, 5 percent as cobbles; 65 percent rounded and subangular weakly cemented durinodes; many distinct calcium carbonate and silica coats on undersides of rock fragments; strongly effervescent matrix, violently effervescent on some durinodes and in some pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 16 inches thick) 

	2Bqkm1--37 to 58 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) strongly cemented duripan with indurated lamellae, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; very hard, very firm; few very fine roots in fractures; few very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 28 inches thick) 

	2Bqkm2--58 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) strongly cemented and indurated hardpan with thin (less than 1/16 inch) laminar cap, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) moist; massive; very hard and extremely hard, very firm and extremely firm; 40 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent. 

TYPE LOCATION: Nye County, Nevada; approximately 2500 feet south and 100 feet east of the northwest corner of section 25, T. 15 S., R. 49 E.

Structure: Weak or moderate, medium or coarse. 

Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent. 

Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. 

Bk2 horizon - Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shamock soils are on fan remnants, alluvial plains and relict alluvial flats. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 2,400 to 3,800 feet. The climate is arid with cool winters and summers are hot and dry, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; average annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 300 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo, Corbilt and Canutio series. Corbilt soils have a hardpan below the control section, but within a depth of 60 inches. Arizo and Canutio soils are skeletal and lack a hardpan within a depth of 60 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly creosotebush with some chorizanthe, Indian ricegrass and white bursage. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30., Shamock soils are moderately extensive.
