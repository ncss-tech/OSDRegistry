MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina; 2003. 

REMARKS: Siloam soils were previously mapped as Wilkes soils. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of a mesic counterpart. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 10 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 15 inches (Bt horizon)
Paralithic contact--the contact at 15 inches (Cr horizon)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 15 to 26 inches (Cr horizon) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Presence of hard bedrock at 26 inches (R horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 25 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: No laboratory data available.
