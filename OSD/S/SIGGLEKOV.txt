SIGGLEKOV SERIES

The Sigglekov series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium. Sigglekov soils are on floodplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Aquic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Sigglekov loam, on a 1 percent slope, on a flood plain, in an area of deciduous forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 23 centimeters; about 50 percent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and about 50 percent very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (15 to 23 centimeters thick)

 C1--23 to 38 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam; massive; very friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; common fine distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) redoximorphic depletions; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 C2--38 to 51 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sand; single grain; loose; common fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 C3--51 to 89 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 C4--89 to 200 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) coarse sand; single grain; loose; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 104-Eastern Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies, Black Hawk County, Iowa subset; about 2 miles northeast of Dunkerton; located about 2,450 feet north and 350 feet east of the southwest corner of section 23, T. 90 N., R. 11 W; USGS Littleton topographic quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees 35 minutes 34.3 seconds N. and long. 92 degrees 7 minutes 12.2 seconds W; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--sandy alluvium
Landform--flood plains
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--300 to 400 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--7 to 10 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation--735 to 940 millimeters
Frost-free period--160 to 195 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Sigglekov soils are commonly mapped in a complex with Fluvaquents, Fluvents, and/or Aquents, ponded.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at a depth between 0.3 and 1 meter during April to June in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation and is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--10 to 100 micrometers per second
Flooding--frequent flooding for long duration during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are forested. The native vegetation is mixed timber and prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Dissected till plains
MLRA--Eastern Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (104)
LRR M; northwestern Iowa and southwestern Minnesota
Extent--small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Black Hawk County, Iowa, 2001.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A, C1, C2, C3 and C4 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters (A, C1, C2, C3 and C4 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (A horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Sigglekov soils were previously identified as alluvial land.
