SHOTSPRINGS SERIES

The Shotsprings series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes.  They formed in mixed volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum from basalt. Slopes are 20 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Shotsprings ashy sandy loam -- upland forest, on a 55 percent convex slope, north aspect, at 5,100 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted; apparent field textures.)

  Oi--0 to 2 inches, slightly decomposed Douglas-fir litter and duff.

  A1--2 to 5 inches, brown (10YR 4/3) ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist: moderate thin to medium platy structure; very soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. 

  A2--5 to 12 inches, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium, and common coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 7 to 14 inches)
