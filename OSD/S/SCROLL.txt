SCROLL SERIES

The Scroll series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in 8 to 20 inches of clayey or silty alluvium and the underlying sandy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Aquic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Scroll silty clay, on a 1 percent slope, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 1,045 feet above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) and olive gray (5Y 4/2) silty clay; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine roots; few fine prominent dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

 Cg1--7 to 11 inches; alternating layers of grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) and olive gray (5Y 4/2) silt loam; massive; friable; few fine roots; common fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

 2Cg2--11 to 43 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) and light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loamy fine sand; single grain; loose; common fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 2Cg3--43 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) fine sandy loam; single grain; loose; strongly effervescent, slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--8 to 20 inches of clayey or silty alluvium and the underlying sandy alluvium
Landform--flood plains
Slopes--0 to 6 percent
Elevation--700 to 1,260 feet above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--46 to 55 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation--20 to 36 inches
Frost-free period--135 to 190 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grable, Haynie, Lossing, Morconick, and Percival soils.
Grable--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Scroll soils, have a clay content of 12 to 16 percent in the upper half of the particle-size control section, and do not have a saturated zone within a depth of 6 feet during April to June in most years
Haynie--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Scroll soils, have a clay content of 15 to 18 percent throughout the particle-size control section, and have a saturated zone between depths of 4 to 6 feet during April to June in most years
Lossing--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Scroll soils, have a clay content of 18 to 35 percent throughout the particle-size control section, and have a saturated zone between depths of 2 to 4 feet during April to June in most years
Morconick--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Scroll soils, have a clay content of 2 to 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and do not have a saturated zone within a depth of 6 feet during April to June in most years
Percival--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Scroll soils, have a clay content of 40 to 60 percent in the upper third to upper half of the particle-size control section, and have a saturated zone between depths of 1 to 3 feet during March to June in most years

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within depths of 1 to 3 feet during March to June in most years and is considered apparent
Permeability--slow or moderately slow in the clayey or silty alluvium and rapid in the underlying sandy alluvium
Surface runoff potential--low or very low
Flooding--rare to occasional flooding with very brief or brief duration during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt and flooding from streambank overflow is limited where dams and levees protect areas

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans and small grains. Some areas are irrigated. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, western wheatgrass, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR M, MLRAs 107 and 102B; along the flood plain of the Missouri River in Iowa and South Dakota. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monona County, Iowa, 1995.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 10 to 40 inches (Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth 60 inches (Ap, Cg1, 2Cg2, and 2Cg3 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
