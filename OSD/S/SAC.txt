SAC SERIES

The Sac series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess and in the underlying till.  These soils occur on ridgetops and convex side slopes on the loess-mantled early Wisconsin (Tazewell) or Kansan till plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clay County, Iowa, 1970.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:  
mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 41 centimeters (Ap, A, and AB horizons); 
cambic horizon--the zone from 41 to 140 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, 2Bw3, 2Bk1, 2Bk2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on saturation above a depth of 1 meter and is supported by the presence of redoximorphic features.

Further investigation is needed to determine the structural class of the lower C or BC horizons.  This till typically exhibits fractures and structural planes to depths of 2 meters or more.

This soil was previously considered as well drained.  Field evidence of saturation and redoximorphic patterns support the current concept of moderately well drained.  

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data from the NSSL.
