SILVER CREEK SERIES

The Silver Creek series includes very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains or low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 58 centimeters (23 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natraquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Silver Creek silt loam, with a slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Bt1--25 to 36 centimeters (10 to 14 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium columnar structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

   Bt2--36 to 53 centimeters (14 to 21 inches); dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) silty clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium columnar structure parting to moderate medium blocky; hard, firm; violent effervescence; streaks and soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

   Btk--53 to 69 centimeters (21 to 27 inches); gray (2.5Y 5/1) silty clay, dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; violent effervescence; streaks and soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 30 to 61 centimeters (12 to 24 inches) thick)

   BCk--69 to 97 centimeters (27 to 38 inches); gray (2.5Y 6/1) silt loam, gray (2.5Y 5/1) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; violent effervescence; streaks and soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches) thick)

   C1--97 to 107 centimeters (38 to 42 inches); light olive gray (5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) moist iron masses in the soil matrix; massive; slightly hard, very friable; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) thick)

   C2--107 to 203 centimeters (42 to 80 inches); light olive gray (5Y 6/2) loamy fine sand, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; common coarse distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) moist iron masses in the soil matrix; single grain; soft, loose; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Buffalo County, Nebraska; 2.4 kilometers (1 1/2 miles) south and 2.4 kilometers (1 1/2 miles) east of Gibbon; 338 meters (1,110 feet) south and 46 meters (150 feet) east of the northwest corner, sec. 29, T. 9 N., R. 13 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils in this family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: alluvium 
Landform: high flood plains or low stream terraces
Slope: 0 to 2 percent  
Mean annual precipitation: 46 to 66 centimeters (18 to 26 inches)  
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 11 degrees C. (49 to 52 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gibbon, Hall, Hord, Leshara, Lamo, Rusco, and Wood River soils.
Gibbon soils occur above Silver Creek. 
Hall and Hord soils are on Stream terraces, contain less clay, do not have a natric horizon, and free calcium carbonates are deeper.  
Lamo and Leshara soils are on flood plains, do not have a natric horizon, are fine-silty, and Lamo soils have a thicker mollic epipedon.  
Rusco soils are in depreesions, lack a natric horizon and are fine-silty.
Wood River soils on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained  
Runoff: low  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:    low over moderately high
Depth to the seasonal high water table: 61 centimeters (2 feet) in wet seasons to 122 centimeters (4 feet) in dry seasons  
Flooding: rare or occasional

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is cultivated.  
Principal crops are corn, sorghum, and alfalfa.  
Many areas are irrigated.  
The range is native grasses of big bluestem, indiangrass, prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, and little bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly along the Platte River in central Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.
