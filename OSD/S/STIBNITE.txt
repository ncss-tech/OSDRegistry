GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahtell, Cirquecreek, Haleycreek, Ottaway, Ride, and Tsina series. 
Ahtell soils have folistic and umbric epipedons and occur on hill tops and hillside positions.
Cirquecreek soils are well drained, have a cambic horizon, and occur on saddles and mountain slopes
Haleycreek soils have a mollic epipedon and occur on hillslopes of mountains and river valleys.
Ottoway soils have permafrost between 50 and 100cm (20 to 39 in), have a mollic epipedon, form on slopes over 25 percent, and occur on hills and mountain slopes.
Ride soils are somewhat excessively drained, have a cambic horizon, and occur on mountain slopes and hillslopes.
Tsina soils are extremely flaggy starting at a depth of 10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 in), and occur on mountain slopes above 800 m (2600ft) elevation.
