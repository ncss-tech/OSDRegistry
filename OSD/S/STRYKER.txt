STRYKER SERIES

The Stryker series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

USE AND VEGETATION:  Stryker soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and for wildlife habitat.  The forest overstory consists of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce.  The forest understory is mainly pinegrass, common snowberry, heartleaf arnica, and mahonia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Stryker soils are of moderately extensive in mountain valleys of western Montana. MLRAs 43A, 44A and 44B
