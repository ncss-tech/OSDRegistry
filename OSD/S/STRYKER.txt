STRYKER SERIES

The Stryker series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Stryker soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and for wildlife habitat.  The forest overstory consists of Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce.  The forest understory is mainly pinegrass, common snowberry, heartleaf arnica, and Oregongrape.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Stryker soils are of limited extent in mountain valleys of western Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Upper Flathead Valley Area, Montana, 1957. The type location is moved to Lewis and Clark County, Montana by correlation of the Soil Survey of Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Records:  MT0630.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an albic horizon from the soil surface to 3 inches (E horizon); a glossic horizon from 3 to 7 inches (E/Bt horizon); an argillic horizon from 7 to 40 inches with mottles below 27 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons); a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulations from 40 to 48 inches (Bk horizon); a discontinuity from 48 tp 60 inches (2C horizon).  Stryker soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

Classification changed to Typic Haplustalfs in 1997.
