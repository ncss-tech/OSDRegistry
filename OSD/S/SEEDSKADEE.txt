SEEDSKADEE SERIES

This series consists of well-drained, light-colored, moderately fine textured, mildly to moderately alkaline, thin Sierozem soils developing in moderately coarse textured, calcareous parent materials weathered residually from sandstone and interbedded shales.  Typically they have light-colored, granular A horizons, B2t horizons having prismatic and subangular blocky structure, and weak to moderate ca horizons.  They resemble the soils of the Saddle series but differ in having bedrock at 18 inches or less.  They differ from the Travessilla and Ocean Lake series in having B2t horizons.  They differ from the Worland series in having a B2t horizon and in having bedrock at 18 inches or less.  At their type location they have an average annual precipitation of 8 inches, and average annual air temperature of 38 degrees F., and an average summer air temperature of 60 degrees F.  These are relatively inextensive soils and only moderately important agriculturally.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Seedskadee channery sandy loam.

     A1--0 to 4 inches; light brownish-gray (10YR 6/2, dry) to dark grayish-brownish (10YR 4/2, moist) sandy loam; strong very fine granular structure; soft dry, very friable moist; noncalcareous, pH 7.4; clear smooth boundary.  2 to 5 inches thick.

     B2t--4 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3, dry) to brown or dark-brown (10YR 4/3, moist) sandy clay loam; weak coarse prismatic structure breaking to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard dry, very friable moist; moderate numbers of thin patchy clay films on both the horizontal and vertical faces of the soil aggregates, and clay coatings on gravel fragments and clay bridges between sand grains in this horizon; noncalcareous, pH 7.6; clear smooth boundary.  4 to 9 inches thick.

     B3ca--12 to 16 inches; light olive-brown (2.5Y 5/3, dry) to olive-brown (2.5Y 4/3, moist) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard dry, very friable moist; there are some clay coatings on channery fragments in this horizons; 10 percent flagstone and channery; weak to moderate ca horizon with visible calcium carbonate occurring mostly as coatings on flags and channery; calcareous, pH 8.0; clear wavy boundary.  2 to 4 inches thick.

     R--16 inches; fractured platy sandstone with about 5 percent fines.

TYPE LOCATION:  750 feet north and 250 feet west of the south quarter4r corner of sec. 21, T. 25 N., R. 106 W., Sweetwater County, Wyoming.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Color of the A1 horizon may range in hue from 2.5Y to 10YR, in chroma from 1.5 to 3, and in value from 5 to 6 dry and 4 to 5 moist.  Color of the B2t horizon may range in hue from 2.5Y to 7.5YR, in chroma from 2 to 4, and in value from 5 to 6 dry and 4 to 5 moist.  Reaction of the A and B2t horizons range from pH 7.0 to pH 8.0.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the ca horizon is typically about 5 percent but may range from 2 to 12 percent.  Texture of the B2t horizon is typically a light sandy clay loam or heavy sandy loam but may range in clay from 10 to 25 percent, in silt from 5 to 30 percent, and in sand from 50 to 80 percent.  Content of coarse channery and flagstone fragments range from 5 to 20 percent.  Depth to noncalcareous material ranges from 6 to 14 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 8 to 18 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 8 to 18 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Gently to moderately sloping upland hills and flat-topped mesa-like land forms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily as rangeland.  Sage, needle-and-thread, and cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West central Wyoming.
