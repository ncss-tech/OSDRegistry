SHIRK SERIES

The Shirk series consists of moderately deep; well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from non-calcareous shale. Shirk soils are on hills on sedimentary plains. Slopes range from 10 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (about 12 inches); the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees Celsius (about 45 degrees Fahrenheit).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: 
Shirk clay loam in an area of native range (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).
 A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate, medium, granular structure; soft, friable; many roots; neutral; clear, smooth boundary.
 Bw--8 to 36 centimeters (3 to 14 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak, moderate to coarse, angular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few roots; neutral; clear, smooth boundary.
 Bt--36 to 51 centimeters (14 to 20 inches); grayish brown (2.5YR 5/2) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak, fine to medium, angular blocky structure; very few faint clay films; slightly hard, firm, sticky, and plastic; few roots; neutral; clear, smooth boundary.
 C--51 to 66 centimeters (20 to 26 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; structureless; slightly hard, firm, sticky, and plastic; many fine and few medium chips of platy shale, 1.5 to 3 centimeters (0.5 to 1 inch) in diameter; neutral; clear, smooth boundary.
 R--66 centimeters (26 inches); fractured, non-calcareous, platy shale.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Capps, Chugter, Deacon, Shore, Tejana, Valle series.
Capps soils do not have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (about 20 and 40 inches).
Chugter soils do not have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (about 20 and 40 inches).
Deacon soils do not have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (about 20 and 40 inches).
Shore soils do not have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (about 20 and 40 inches).
Tejana soils do not have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (about 20 and 40 inches).
Valle soils do not have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (about 20 and 40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Sedimentary plains
Landform: Hills
Parent material: Residuum weathered from non-calcareous shale
Elevation: 1,524 to 1,676 meters (about 5,000 to 5,500 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 7 to 9 degrees Celsius (about 45 to 48 degrees Fahrenheit)
Mean annual precipitation: 254 to 356 millimeters (about 10 to 14 inches)
Frost free days: 110 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Moret and Wormser soils. Moret soils are shallow to a lithic contact and on higher landform positions. Wormser soils have a fine textured particle-size class, are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and on lower landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are principally used for range and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is western wheatgrass and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Wyoming. The series is of small extent.
