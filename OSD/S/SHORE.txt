SHORE SERIES

The Shore series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in mixed alluvial deposits on terraces and flood plains in the Central High Tablelands (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C. (56 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is 46 centimeters (18 inches).
