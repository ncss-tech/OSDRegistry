MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: City of Suffolk, Virginia, 1976.

REMARKS: The Suffolk soils were formerly included in the Sassafras, Norfolk, or Kalmia series. The current series concept limits the base of the argillic horizon to 150 centimeters (about 50 inches) or less with an underlying sandy C horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 41 centimeters (Ap and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 41 to 119 centimeters (Bt and BC horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (Lab Pedon Number: 82P0200; User Pedon ID: 81SC051015).
