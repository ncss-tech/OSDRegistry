SHODDY SERIES

The Shoddy series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, slide deposits or residuum derived from sedimentary rock. These soils are on hills, knolls, ridges and landslides.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Shoddy silty clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 1 inch; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--1 to 5 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bk1--5 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) parachannery silty clay loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and common fine interstitial pores; 25 percent angular shale fragments; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and few fine masses and threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick) 

    Bk2--10 to 16 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) extremely parachannery silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate fine medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots between shale fragments; common very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent angular shale fragments; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and many faint calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of shale fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick) 

    Cr1--16 to 38 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) semiconsolidated shale that crushes to silty clay loam. 

    Cr2--38 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) semiconsolidated silty shale that crushes to silt loam.
