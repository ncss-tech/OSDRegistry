TYPICAL PEDON: Shand peat - on a slope of 0 percent under diamondleaf willow/sedge scrub. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi--0 to 19 inches (0 to 48 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) peat; many very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.

	Oa1--19 to 34 inches (48 to 86 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky; many very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1); gradual smooth boundary.

	Oa2--34 to 38 inches (86 to 97 cm); black (10YR 2/1) muck; few very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary.

	Cg--38 to 60 inches (97 to 152 cm); very dark gray (5Y 3/1) very cobbly sandy loam; massive; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3).

TYPE LOCATION: Delta River Area, Alaska; in the Tangle Lakes area about 3.5 miles northwest of Dickey Lake; UTM coordinates: Zone 6, Easting 539426, Northing 6981312

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture class: aquic
Average annual soil temperature: 34 to 37degrees F (1 to 2.5 degrees C)
Mean summer soil temperature: 36 to 39 degrees F. (2 to 4 degrees C)
Depth to strongly contrasting textural stratification: 38 to 52 inches (97 to 132 cm)

Oi or Oa horizon:
Colorhue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 1 to 4

Organic matter content65 to 90 percent
Reactionstrongly acid to slightly acid

Cg horizon:
Colorhue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 or 4
Textureextremely cobbly sandy loam; very gravelly loam; very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam
Clay content0 to 10 percent
Silt content10 to 40 percent
Sand content45 to 80 percent
Organic matter content0 to 2 percent
Rock fragments20 to 45 percent rounded very strongly cemented gravel; 10 to 35 percent rounded very strongly cemented cobbles

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chillybu and Maybeso series. Chillybu and Maybeso soils have mean annual soil temperatures warmer than 37 degrees F. (2.5C).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: flood plains
Parent material: grassy organic material over gravelly till
Elevation: 2,848 to 2,999 feet (868 to 914 m)
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 24 inches (564 to 607 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Bonot and Fels soils. Bonot soils are very poorly drained, very shallow to shallow to permafrost, and occur on turf hummocks. Fels soils are well drained, shallow or moderately deep to permafrost, and occur on hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the organic layers and moderately high to high in the mineral layer.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is diamondleaf willow/sedge scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
