SASQUATCH SERIES

The Sasquatch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Sasquatch soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is approximately 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is approximately 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Littleriver and Lepoil soils.  Lepoil soils have less than 5 percent gravel and paragravel fragments in the profile. Littleriver soils are derived from fluviomarine deposits

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sasquatch soils are on mountain slopes, hill slopes and broad ridgetops. Slope gradients are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 5 to 565 meters (115 to 1850 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1650 to 2290 millimeters (65 to 90 inches). Mean winter soil temperature (December, January, and February) is approximately 9 degrees C; mean summer soil temperature (June, July, and August) is approximately 14 degrees C; and the mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is less than 6 degrees C. Frost-free season is approximately 250 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Footstep, Ladybird, Sisterrocks, Stonehill, and Yeti soils. Footstep and Stonehill soils are 50 to 100 centimeters to bedrock. Ladybird soils have a 20 percent decrease from the maximum clay content before a depth of 150 centimeters. Sisterrocks soils are loamy-skeletal. Yeti has a fine particle-size control section. The Footstep and Stonehill soils are on strongly convex slopes or on spur ridges above Sasquatch soils. The Ladybird soils are on linear to concave slope positions. The Sisterrocks soils are alongside the Sasquatch soils on very gravelly colluvium. The Yeti soils are in concave positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately low to moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber production, wildlife, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes redwood, Douglas-fir, tanoak, western hemlock, Sitka spruce, rhododendron, evergreen huckleberry, redwood sorrel, and sword fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
