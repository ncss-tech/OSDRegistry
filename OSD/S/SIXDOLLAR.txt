SIXDOLLAR SERIES

The Sixdollar series consists of deep, well drained soils on ridges and upper backslopes of mountains.  Sixdollar soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, frigid Alfic Humic Vitrixerands 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sixdollar ashy loam, woodland, on a 15 percent north-facing slope at elevation of 4,550 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)
