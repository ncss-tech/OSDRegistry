SLOCKEY SERIES

The Slockey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff.  Slockey soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Slockey very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles.

    A--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--10 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 38 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine, common medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and clay bridges between sand grains; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear irregular boundary.

    Bt3--38 to 53 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine, common medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and clay bridges between sand grains; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons is 30 to 90 cm.)

    R--53 cm; hard welded tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; northeast part of the Fairview Range; approximately 1,200 feet south and 1,300 feet west of the northeast corner of section 3, T. 4 N., R. 65 E.; USGS Fairview Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 14 minutes 26 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 40 minutes 5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.2405556 latitude, -114.6680556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 36 cm; includes the upper portion of the argillic horizon.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact.
Volcanic glass content: 35 to 60 percent in the 0.2 to 2.0 mm fraction.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, dominantly 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel. Lithology of the rock fragments is mainly welded tuff.

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist. 

Bt1 horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly ashy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam. 
Clay content: 20 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, most of gravel are 2 to 5 mm. in diameter.
Structure: Medium to coarse subangular blocky.
Consistence: Soft to hard, dry, very friable to firm, moist.

Bt2 and Bt3 horizons
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly ashy clay loam or very gravelly ashy sandy clay loam.
Clay content: 27 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, most of gravel are 2 to 5 mm in diameter.
Structure: Medium to coarse subangular blocky.
Consistence: Soft to hard, dry, very friable to firm, moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cabinspring, Cagas, Derallo, Glassbutte, Jacksplace, and Roughridge series.

Cabinspring soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the control section and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms. Cagas soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and contain 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Derallo soils are deep to a paralithic contact and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms. Glassbutte soils are very deep and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms. Jacksplace soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms.  Roughridge soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Slockey soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,768 to 2,515 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Farepeak and Schoolmarm soils. Farepeak and Schoolmarm soils are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Slockey soils are used for recreation, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, muttongrass, and needleandthread. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28A.
