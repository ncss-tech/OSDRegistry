SAUNDERS SERIES

The Saunders series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aeric Calciaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Saunders silty clay loam, hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate fine platy structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse roots and many fine and very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--5 to 14 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse roots and common fine and very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--14 to 26 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse roots and common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common fine soft masses of lime, disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk2--26 to 32 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; moderate very fine granular structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse roots and common fine and very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; common fine soft masses of lime, disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    BCg--32 to 45 inches; gray (2.5Y 5/1) silty clay, light gray (2.5Y 7/1) dry; few fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist redox concentrations; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear irregular boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Cg--45 to 60 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, gray (5Y 6/1) dry; massive; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few fine soft masses of lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Saunders soils are used mainly for rangeland; some areas are used for irrigated hay and small grains.  Potential native vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, northern reedgrass, tall sedges, slender wheatgrass, and woody plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Saunders soils are inextensive in valleys of the mountains and foothills of southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Madison County Area, Montana, 1983.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0432.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 14 inches (A horizons); a calcic horizon from 14 to 32 inches (Bk horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A2, Bk1, Bk2 and part of the BCg horizons). Saunders soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
