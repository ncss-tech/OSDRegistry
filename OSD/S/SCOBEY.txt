SCOBEY SERIES

The Scobey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till.  These soils are on till plains, hills, and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Scobey clay loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine roots; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick, uncultivated areas have an A horizon 2 or 3 inches thick.)

(5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 19 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on vertical faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles; few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2--19 to 42 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; many fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 30 inches thick)

    Bky--42 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; 5 percent pebbles; common fine masses of lime; common fine masses of gypsum; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
