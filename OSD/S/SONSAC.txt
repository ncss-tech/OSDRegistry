SONSAC SERIES

The Sonsac series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in collivium and the underlying residuum from limestone on upland side slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.

Some pedons have a 2BC, 2C, or 2Cr horizon that is highly variable in color and texture.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Gobbler series.  Gobbler soils have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sonsac soils are on moderately sloping to steep upland side slopes.  They have formed colluvium and the underlying residuum derived from limestone that has a high chert content and is primarily Ordovician or Mississippian in age.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alsup, Goss, Moko and Wilderness series.  Alsup soils are in the fine family class and are deep to a paralithic contact.  Goss and Wilderness soils are very deep to a lithic contact.  Wilderness soils have a fragipan.   Moko soils are very shallow and shallow to a lithic contact.  These soils are on similar landscape positionsas the Sonsac soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  The surface runoff index is medium to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in pasture or woodland.  Native vegetation was mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozark Highland (MLRA 116A) and the Springfield Plain (MLRA 116B) areas in Missouri and the River Hills (MLRA 115) area of southeast Missouri and southwest Illinois.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (A and BA horizons);  
argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 6 to 31 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons).
