SNYDERVILLE SERIES

The Snyderville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash derived from quartzite and sedimentary rocks.  Snyderville soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Snyderville gravelly loam on a south facing linear 2 percent slope in pasture at an elevation of 7,020 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 12, 1997, the soil was moist from 10 to 28 inches.   The surface is covered by 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones.

    A1--0 to 10 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravelly loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular texture; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine, and medium roots and many very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary (6 to 12 inches thick).

    A2--10 to 16 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots and many very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary (5 to 15 inches thick).

    Bt--16 to 28 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam; brown (7.5YR 5/3) dry; moderately fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots and many very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.(5 to 15 inches thick)

    2C--28 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very cobbly loamy sand; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary (5 to 15 inches thick).

    3C--35 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) extremely cobbly sand; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2) clear wavy boundary.
