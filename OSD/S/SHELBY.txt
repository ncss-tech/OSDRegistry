SHELBY SERIES

The Shelby series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in pre-Illinoian till.  These soils are on convex side slopes, crests, and narrow interfluves on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shelby County, Missouri, 1903.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from 28 to 78 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters (Ap, AB, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Btk horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (Ap and AB horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 152 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Btk horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The redoximorphic features described in this pedon are believed to be relict and were not considered as indicators of current wetness conditions. These features were not considered in the classification of these soils.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
