SHATRUCE SERIES

The Shatruce series consists of soils that are well drained, slowly permeable, and moderately deep to claystone bedrock. These soils formed in residuum from claystone and colluvium and occur on backslopes of ridges. Slope is dominantly about 35 percent, but ranges from 8 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Shatruce gravelly sandy loam, very rubbly on a 35 percent slope, in rangeland.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as wildlife land or rangeland. Some areas are inaccessible to domestic livestock. Principal native grasses are little bluestem, silver bluestem, sideoats grama, dropseeds, and annuals, with an overstory of post oak, elm, and ash trees. Forbs include prairie clovers, western ragweed, bundleflower, and lespedeza. Whitebrush, sumac, and condalia occur in various amounts.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Palo Pinto County, Texas; 1979.

REMARKS: This soil has been formerly mapped as a component of the bouldery Truce association. Classification was changed 6/90 from Ultic subgroup to Typic based on base saturation data collected from 13 pedons in Palo Pinto and Jack Counties, Texas.

Edited 12/2013 (RFG-SCP): Changed to tabular format and included metric values. Updated the competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in)(A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon: 36 to 66 cm (14 to 26 in)(Bt horizons)
Paleustalfs feature: abrupt texture change at 36 cm (14 inches)
Densic Material: 86 to 203 cm (34 to 80 inches)(Cd horizon)
