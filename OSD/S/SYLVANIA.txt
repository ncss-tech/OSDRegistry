SYLVANIA SERIES

The Sylvania series consists of deep, moderately well drained, soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on ridgetops and sideslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, active, thermic Oxyaquic Haplohumults

  2Bt3--30 to 40 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay; many fine dark red (2.5YR 3/6) and common fine strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common very fine roots; common distinct continuous clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); gradual smooth boundary. 

  2Bt4--40 to 45 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay; common fine brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) and common fine red (2.5YR 4/8) masses of iron accumulation; weak thin platy structure parting to weak very fine and fine subangular blocky; firm; common distinct continuous clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt and 2Bt horizons is 16 to 48 inches)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on upland ridgetops and sideslopes.  The regolith consists of a mantle of colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from shale or shale and interbedded sandstone.  Sandstone fragments and, in areas where conglomerate is present chert fragments, are commonly part of the colluvium.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 44 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 63 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barco, Barden, and Collinsville soils.  Barco soils have a loamy subsoil, are moderately deep to bedrock and are on similar landscape positions.  Barden soils are very deep, and are commonly on less sloping positions.  Collinsville soils are shallow to bedrock and are on lower side slopes below Sylvania soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff is low to medium.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  A perched zone of water saturation is present in most years from 2.5 to 4 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in pasture or hayland, although some areas are used for row crops.  The kind of native vegetation is uncertain and no longer important because of the current use.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ozark Border Area (MLRA 116B) of southwest Missouri and may extend into the Cherokee Prairie Area (MLRA 112). The series is of moderate extent.
