SAVAGETON SERIES

The Savageton series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  They formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived dominantly from shale on hills, ridges, fan remnants, fan piedmonts and fan aprons.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Savageton clay loam-in an area of native rangeland on an 8 percent east-facing slope.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

    A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; slightly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 26 inches thick)

    Bk--20 to 29 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; strongly effervescent; common medium irregularly shaped, masses of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 23 inches thick)

    Cr--29 to 60 inches; platy, calcareous shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Weston County, Wyoming; 1,320 feet east and 100 feet north of the SW corner of sec. 10, T. 48 N., R. 66 W. 44 degrees 9 minutes north latitude and 104 degrees 46 minutes 27 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 13 to 30 inches but is typically greater than 20 inches.  Because of surface recharge, the soils are more commonly calcareous throughout; but depth to continuous zones of carbonate accumulation (or Bk horizon) is 15 to 30 inches in most pedons.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days. Textures for the entire profile and each horizon are clay loam, clay, silty clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Rock fragments range up to 5 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.

The Bw or cambic horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Dry consistence is hard or very hard.

The Bk or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 5 to 14 percent, but some discontinuous strata exceed 14 percent in some pedons.   The measured ESP is less than 15 percent, but field tests show reactions over 8.6 in many pedons.

The Cr horizon is soft, massive clay shale which limits water intake and root growth.  It forms a paralithic contact.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Degator and Silhouette series.  Degator soils have a frost-free period of less than 105 days.  Silhouette soils have bedrock deeper than 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Savageton soils are on dissected fan piedmonts, fan aprons, ridges and rolling hills controlled by bedrock at moderate depths.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 13 inches with over half falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Silhouette soils and the Bahl, Renohill, Samday and Ulm series.  Bahl and Samday soils lack cambic horizons.  In addition, the Samday soils have bedrock at less than 20 inches.  Renohill and Ulm soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to high runoff depending on slope; and slowly permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing by domestic livestock and wildlife.  Principal native vegetation is western wheatgrass, sedge, blue grama and cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and eastern Wyoming.  It is of moderate extent.
