COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashdos, Ashtre, Lastcall, and Millenium series. 

Ashdos and Ashtre soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Lastcall soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Millenium soils do not have horizons with durinodes. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stauffer soils are on lakebeds. These soils formed in eolian materials and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,405 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Millenium soil and the Borobey and Raztack soils. Borobey soils do not have argillic horizons and average 8 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Raztack soils are fine, deep to duripans, and have ochric epipedons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Stauffer soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and Thurber's needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 360 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
