SIGNALHILL SERIES

The Signalhill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits over residuum. These soils are on structural benches, dipslopes, fan remnants, escarpments, scarp slopes and landslides. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Signalhill loam, on a 5 percent slope in native rangeland at an elevation of 2,218 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 12 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt1--12 to 32 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine, and common medium and coarse roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 65 percent distinct clay films on all ped faces; 25 percent gravel and 12 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--32 to 56 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; 55 percent distinct clay films on all ped faces; 35 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 46 to 78 cm)

    R--56 to 152 cm; hard sandstone bedrock.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 12 cm (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - from 12 to 56 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Lithic contact - at 56 cm (R horizon)
