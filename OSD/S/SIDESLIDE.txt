SIDESLIDE SERIES

The Sideslide series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from Mancos shale.  Sideslide soils are in drainageways, and on hillslopes and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Sideslide silty clay loam, on a southwest facing, 5 percent slope, in pasture at an elevation of 2,012 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on September 16 1996, the soil profile was moist and was saturated below 38 cm from the surface.)

    Ap--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; moderately hard, very firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots throughout; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw--8 to 64 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron accumulations; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots throughout; common very fine, fine, and medium discontinuous tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (13 to 102 cm thick)

    C1--64 to 102 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron accumulations and common prominent gray (2.5Y 6/1) iron depletions; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many continuous faint pressure faces throughout; common very fine and few moderate roots throughout; common very fine and fine discontinuous tubular pores; few fine carbonate threads; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (13 to 102 cm thick)

    C2--102 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; common fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron masses and common prominent gray (2.5Y 6/1) iron depletions; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few fine carbonate threads; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).  (0 to 76 cm thick)
