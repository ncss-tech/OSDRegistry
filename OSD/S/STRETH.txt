STRETH SERIES

The Streth series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from calcareous sandstone. These soils are on cuestas. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.2 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Streth gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

 A--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots throughout; many fine and very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 cm thick)

 Bk1--5 to 33 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine roots throughout; many fine and very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; 15 percent calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 5 percent threadlike calcium carbonate masses on surfaces along root channels; strongly effervescent; 13 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (24 to 30 cm thick)

 Bk2--33 to 58 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; 10 percent calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 10 percent calcium carbonate masses in matrix; strongly effervescent; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

 R--58 cm; sandstone bedrock
