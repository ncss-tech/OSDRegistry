SANDRIFT SERIES 

The Sandrift series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in water worked sands and/or eolian sands.  These soils develop on the edges of lakebeds and on dune slacks. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 390 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Oxyaquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Sandrift fine sandy loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at 2,040 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

       A -- 0 to 27 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 37 cm thick)

       Bw -- 27 to 46 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; very slightly effervescent, slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (19 to 64 cm thick)

       BC -- 46 to 94 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent (common) medium faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), moist, masses of oxidized iron; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 90 cm thick)

       C -- 94 to 159 centimeters; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent (many) medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations (masses of oxidized iron); many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - lakebed and dune slack
Elevation - 2,020 to 2,050 meters
Slope - 0 to 4 percent
Parent materials - water worked sands and/or eolian sands
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 355 to 430 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 4 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils typically occur in native range and are used for grazing cattle and for wildlife habitat. Vegetation is chiefly sagebrush, needle-and-thread, Idaho fescue and lupine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Sandrift series is of small extent in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA - 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Red Rock Lakes Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2012; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2010.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 27 cm (A horizon)
Oxyaquic criteria - distinct redoximorphic features at 94 cm (C horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A, Bw, BC, and part of the C horizons)

Sandrift soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime and an oxyaquic moisture subclass.
