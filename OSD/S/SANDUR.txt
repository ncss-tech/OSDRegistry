MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Portland, Oregon

SERIES PROPOSED:  Malheur National Forest, Oregon 2007.  Name is coined. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic subgroup feature:  0 to 31 inches
aeric subgroup feature: moist color having hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2 from 8 to 31 inches
particle-size control section:  10 to 40 inches is sandy-skeletal
redoximorphic depletions:  4 to 31 inches    

Fluvially washed, sand and rock fragments in lower substratum are assumed to be void of organic carbon needed for Fluvaquents criterion. Rapid streamflow has also removed volcanic glass from the fluvial materials.
