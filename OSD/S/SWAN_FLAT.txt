SWAN FLAT SERIES

The Swan Flat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from  limestone or calcareous siltstone.  Swan Flat soils are on north and east slopes of hills, mountains and summits. Slopes are 10 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Calcicryolls

(10 to 30 inches thick)

    Bk4--56 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very channery silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; few very fine roots; few fine irregular pores; few fine carbonate masses in the matrix; violently effervescent; 30 percent channers and 15 percent flagstones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Vo (T) series.  Vo soils have horizons with accumulations of secondary silica and occur in areas that average 11 to 14 inches of annual precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: hillslopes, mountain slopes, and summits (dominantly north and east aspects)
Elevation: 5,900 to 7,500 feet
Slope: 10 to 50 percent
Parent material: mixed alluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from limestone or calcareous siltstone
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry, summers. 
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature: 36 to 40 degrees F. 
Frost-free season: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Danburn, Grunder (T), and Richollow (T) series. Danburn and Grunder soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons and have forest overstory of Douglas fir and aspen. Richollow soils are shallow over limestone bedrock and are on ridges and summits near areas of rock outcrop.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Swan Flat soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, snowberry, serviceberry, arrowleaf balsamroot and twisted leaf.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. These soils are of small extent. MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.
