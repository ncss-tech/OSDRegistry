SEPULVEDA SERIES


The Sepulveda series are well drained soils that formed in human-transported material (HTM) found on alluvial fan remnants that originate from sedimentary sources. Sepulveda soils are on cut/fill and localized raised land in areas that have been graded. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, spolic, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Sepulveda clay loam - urban environment. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise noted.)

 ^C4--188 to 200 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; massive; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine faint irregular yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron-manganese masses in matrix surrounding redox depletions and common medium distinct irregular grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

Calcium carbonate: some pedons have masses of calcium carbonate 
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent, some pedons have up to 25 percent rock fragments in the substratum.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Dapplegray soil.
Dapplegray soils: have up to 35 percent rock fragments that have been detached from in-situ bedrock by machinery and mixed into the profile of cut and filled hillslope terraces on hills.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: alluvial plain, coastal plain.
Landform: locally raised land, hillslope terraces, cut and fill on existing alluvial fan remnants.
Parent material: human-transported materials originating from alluvium from primarily sedimentary sources.
Elevation: 0 to 300 meters.
Slope: 0 to 15 percent.
Climate: warm dry summers and cool moist winter.
Mean annual precipitation: 356 mm. 
Mean annual air temperature: 17 to 18 degrees C.
Frost free season: 300 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Botella, Centinela, Counterfeit, Grommet, Montebello, Pierview, Ramona and Windfetch soils.
Botella soils: have a mollic epipedon and have an argillic horizon formed on remnant alluvium fans.
Centinela soils: have a fine particle-size class on uplifted alluvium and alluvial bottoms.
Counterfeit soils: have fine particle-size class on hillslope terraces.
Grommet soils: have a mollic epipedon and are formed from alluvium on slightly lower positions.
Montebello soils: have human-transported materials derived from material weathered from granitic sources, typically does not have calcium carbonate.
Pierview soils: have an argillic horizon that extends below a depth of 150 cm on nearby landscapes.
Ramona soils: have an argillic horizon and formed on remnant alluvial fans from granitic sources.
Windfetch soils: have a mollic epipedon and argillic horizon on nearby landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Sepulveda soils are used for residential neighborhoods in urban areas. Vegetation is ornamental plants, trees, and sod.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal plains and valleys of southern California; MLRA 19. These soils are of small extent.

REMARKS: 

Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric Epipedon: the zone from a depth of 0 to 24 cm
Artifacts: the zone from a depth of 0 to 24 cm
Human transported materials: the zone from a depth of 0 to 200 cm
Particle size control section: the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 cm

Soil structure and secondary carbonates in the human-transported materials are considered geogenic properties having been formed prior to transport.

Taxonomic subgroup tagged as 'typic' due to presence of human-transported materials.  The soil has properties and occurs on appropriate landforms to support the concept of human-transported materials.  The use of the Anthroportic subgroup is not currently permitted in the xeric soil moisture regime, but will be explored for future consideration for correlation.
