STASH SERIES

The Stash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from loess and volcanics. They are on toeslopes of canyonsides and foothills and have slopes of 20 to 30 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stash extremely stony clay loam on a 25 percent southeast facing slope, in rangeland at 5,200 feet elevation.  When described on August 7, 1990, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely stony clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate, medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine and very fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; many fine and coarse irregular and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 11 inches thick)

     Bt1--11 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine and medium prismatic structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many fine and coarse irregular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; 2 percent fine manganese concentrations; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

     Bt2--17 to 41 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong fine, medium and coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine and coarse irregular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones;  2 percent fine manganese concentrations; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 24 inches thick)

     Bq1--41 to 48 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; weakly cemented with silica; 2 percent fine manganese concentrations; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 3 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

     Bq2--48 to 62 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; weakly cemented with silica; 2 percent fine manganese concentrations; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Gooding County, Idaho; about 15 miles north of Bliss.  500 feet north, 2,400 feet west of the southeast corner of section 11, T.3S., R.12E.; Lat. 43 degrees north, 10 minutes, 15 seconds; Long. 115 degrees west, 0 minutes, 15 seconds.

Mollic epipedon - 10 to 19 inches thick
Base saturation above 30 inches - 50 to 75 percent
Some pedons may lack a Bq horizon

A horizon
Value - 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
Rock fragments - 5 to 25 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, 5 to 10 percent stones

Bt1 and Bt2 horizon
Value - 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 3 or 4 dry or moist

Clay content - 32 to 50 percent but averages more than 35 percent Rock fragments - 15 to 25 percent gravel, 15 to 20 percent cobbles, 5 to 10 percent stones
Reaction - slightly acid to neutral

Bq horizon
Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma - 3 to 6 dry or moist
Rock fragments - 15 to 25 percent gravel, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cavanaugh, Elksel, and Howcree (T) series.  The Cavanaugh soil is moderately deep to bedrock.  The Elksel soil is deep to bedrock.  The Howcree soil has silica accumulations above 40 inches and has less than 5 percent cobbles in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stash soils are on toeslopes of canyonsides and foothills.  Slopes are 20 to 30 percent. The soils formed in colluvium derived from loess and volcanics. Elevation is 5,000 to 5,800 feet. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches. The average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Moreglade, Molyneux and Skelter series. Moreglade is loamy-skeletal and Molyneux and Skelter are fine-loamy. They are all found on canyon escarpments and hills at mid-slope.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Stash soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.
