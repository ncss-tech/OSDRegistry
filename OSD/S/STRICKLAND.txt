STRICKLAND SERIES

The Strickland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from basalt and tuff.  Strickland soils are on plateaus, mountains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Strickland loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 33 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist, weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary (23 to 46 cm thick)

    Bw1--33 to 46 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary (0 to 28 cm thick.)

    Bw2--46 to 71 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 38 cm thick)

    R--71 cm; fractured tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada, about 4 miles east of Owyhee, 1,200 feet north and 100 feet east of the southwest corner of section 16, T.  47 N., R. 53 E.; USGS Owyhee 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 58 minutes 10 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 02 minutes 03 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.9694444 latitude,  - 116.0341667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist, dry in late July through early October. Typic xeric moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature - 2.2 to 5.6 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature - 12.7 to 15.0 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock - 50 to 100 cm.

Cambic horizon (Bw) - Horizon always has evidence of clay movement, but does not have the necessary clay increase required for an argillic horizon.

Base saturation by sum of cations - 50 to 75 percent.


A horizon
Hue:  5YR or 10YR.
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry, 1 or 2 moist.
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent.
Reaction:  Slightly acid to strongly acid.

Bw horizon
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Loam or cobbly loam.
Clay content:  18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments:  5 to 30 percent.
Reaction:  Slightly acid through strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adel, Bullrey, Duff, Gallatin, Hackwood, Karlan, Lamphier, Leavittville, Lespate, Mundos, Osmund, Pavohroo, Rhone, Secondset, Taterheap and Winevada series. Adel, Bullrey, Duff, Gallatin, Hackwood, Lamphier, Leavittville, Mundos, Osmund, Pavohroo, Rhone and Taterheap soils have bedrock at a depth of 40 inches or more.  Karlan, Leavittville, Mundos, and Osmund soils have a Bk horizon.  Lespate soils have Bw horizons, and have Bk horizon above bedrock and lack evidence of clay films.  Secondset soils do not have Bt horizon and have mollic epipedon that are greater than 18 inches thick. Winevada soils lack a Bt horizon and lack clay films on peds and have a paralithic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Strickland soils are on concave side slopes of basalt plateaus, mountains and hills.  These soils formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,320 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 460 to 560 mm; mean annual temperature is 1.7 to 4.4 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 20 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bluebell, Dranyon, Parkay, and Tusel soils.  Bluebell soils are on convex hilltops and hill slopes.  Dranyon, Parkay, and Tusel soils are on concave hill slopes.  Bluebell and Parkay soils have a loamy-skeletal argillic horizon.  Dranyon and Tusel soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, western snowberry, serviceberry, common chokecherry, mountain brome, slender wheatgrass, and mulesear wyethia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada and southwestern Idaho.  The soils are not extensive. MLRA 25.
