SETTERS SERIES

The Setters series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess or loess over silty sediments.  Setters soils are on ridge summits, backslopes and footslopes of hills on dissected basalt plateaus, mountains and benches.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Ultic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Setters silt loam, cultivated, on a 10 percent south-facing slope at 2,600 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  The Hankins series is in a similar family.  Hankins soils do not have an E horizon, have a mollic epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick, and a linear extensibility of more than 6 cm in the upper 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Setters soils are on convex positions of loess covered ridge summits, backslopes, and footslopes of hills on dissected basalt plateaus, mountains and benches.  These soils formed in loess or loess over silty sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Elevations are 1100 to 4300 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 22 to 35 inches.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Carlinton, Taney, and Wilkins soils.  All these soils are on basalt plateaus.  Carlinton soils have a fragipan and lack a mollic epipedon.  Taney soils are fine-silty and have a fragipan.  Wilkins soils are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well-drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part of the profile and very slow in the lower part.  A perched water table is at its uppermost limit from December through May. Occasional, brief ponding can occur from November to July.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for wheat, barley, peas, hay, pasture, and timber production.  The natural vegetation is mainly an overstory of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine and an understory of common snowberry, woods rose, white spirea, pine reed grass, and sticky geranium.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Benewah, Clearwater, Kootenai, Latah, Lewis, and Nez Perce Counties, Idaho.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 16 inches (A and B horizons)

Albic Horizon - the zone from 16 to 17 inches (E horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 60 inches (Btb horizons)

Particle-size control section - the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon (the zone from 17 to 37 inches)

Linear extensibility (LE) - the zone from 0 to 40 inches is assumed to be less than 6.0 cm based on lab data.

Soil moisture regime - xeric

Soil temperature regime - frigid

This soil would qualify for an oxyaquic subgroup of Palexerolls if such a subgroup was available in Soil Taxonomy.

Additional data: NSSL reference analyses are available for this series: 85ID061055 (86P0243) and 86ID069003 (86P883) from the Lewis-Nez Perce, Idaho soil survey area.
