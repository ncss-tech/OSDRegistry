Bohicket soils--are on broad level tidal marsh flats bordering the Atlantic Ocean and formed in silty and clayey marine sediments.
Carteret soils--are on back-barrier island tidal marshes of the Atlantic Coast and formed in sandy marine deposits.
Chowan soils--are on riverine floodplains and formed in loamy marine sediments over highly decomposed organic material.
Fort Caswell soils--are on high-energy submerged wave-cut platforms and shoals formed in sandy estuarine deposits throughout and do not have hypersulfidic soil materials.
Fort Fisher soils-- are in barrier coves and submerged wave-cut platforms fluctuating from low to high energy formed from sandy over loamy intermixed estuarine deposits and do not have hypersulfidic soil materials.
Kureb soils--are on gently sloping to moderately steep soils on Coastal Plain uplands and side slopes along streams and bay and formed in marine, aeolian, or fluvial sands throughout. 
Molasses Creek soils-- are in estuarine tidal streams and barrier coves and formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and also do not contain hypersulfidic soil materials.
Newhan soils--are on gently undulating dunes commonly near beaches and waterways, do not have water at or near the soil surface, and formed in sand and shelly eolian deposits along the Atlantic Coast.
Prices Creek soils-- are in estuarine tidal streams and formed in fine-loamy estuarine deposits.
Showboat soils--are in mainland coves and estuarine tidal streams formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and contain 40 centimeters of buried organic soil material within 200 centimeters of the soil surface.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: New Hanover County, North Carolina, 2024

REMARKS: 
Sunny Point is derived from Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, one of the largest military terminals in the world. The facility is situated on an Army-owned 8,500-acre site on the banks of the Cape Fear River in Brunswick and New Hanover counties of North Carolina.  

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022)--

Sulfidic materials--22 to 130 centimeters (9 to 51 inches, Cseg2 and Cseg3 horizons)
n-value > 0.7--0 to 221 centimeters (0 to 87 inches). 
Reduced Matrix--0 to 221 centimeters (0 to 87 inches); soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but undergoes a change in hue or chroma within 30 minutes after the soil material has been exposed to air.
Endosaturation--0 to 221 centimeters (0 to 87 inches). 
Peraquic feature-Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface.
