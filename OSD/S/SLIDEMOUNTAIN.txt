SLIDEMOUNTAIN SERIES

The Slidemountain series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from igneous rock.  These soils occur on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Slidemountain gravelly loam, in forest on a 12 percent slope at an elevation of 2615 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oi--0 to 6 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 cm thick)

 A--6 to 22 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (14 to 25 cm thick)

 Bt1--22 to 36 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--36 to 45 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 50 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons is 15 to 25 cm)

 R--45 to 152 cm; indurated basalt bedrock.
