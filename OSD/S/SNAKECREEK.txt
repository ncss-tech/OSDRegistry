SNAKECREEK SERIES

The Snakecreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from Holocene age alluvium. These nearly level soils are on drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 1. Mean annual temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in).

Additional Comments: This series was established during the update of MLRA 150A. These soils were included with the Bibb, Katy, Nahatche, and Wockley, series in previous surveys.
 
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data from a representative pedon from Austin County, Texas (S00TX-015-001).
