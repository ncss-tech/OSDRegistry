STONEBARN SERIES

The Stonebarn series consist of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes are from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Stonebarn clay loam, 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,439 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 11 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 3 percent fine 7.5YR 6/6 oxidized iron masses and 2 percent fine 2.5Y 6/2 iron depletions; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

   AC--11 to 27 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 7 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses and 10 percent fine 2.5Y 6/2 iron depletions; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

   2Cg--27 to 200 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) extremely gravelly loamy sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; 5 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses and 40 percent 5Y 6/1 iron depletions; 65 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - flood plains
Elevation - 1,085 - 1,500 meters
Slope - 0 to 4 percent slopes
Parent material - alluvium
Mean annual precipitation - 127 to 229 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 6 to 8 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; moderately slow over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Stonebarn soils are used for wildlife and livestock grazing. Native vegetation is alkali cordgrass, alkali sacaton, mountain rush, Nebraska sedge, and American licorice. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Stonebarn soils are of small extent in northwest Wyoming. MLRA 32.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Park County, Wyoming; 2016. The name is taken from a local landform.

REMARKS:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 11 cm (A horizon)
Redoximorphic concentrations - from 0 to 200 cm (A, AC and 2Cg horizons) 
Redoximorphic depletions - from 0 to 200 cm (A, AC and 2Cg horizons) 
Strong gleying - from 27 to 200 cm (2Cg horizon)
Lithological discontinuity - from 27 to 200 cm (2Cg horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the AC and 2Cg horizons)

Stonebarn soils have a mesic temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
