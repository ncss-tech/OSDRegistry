SPONSOR SERIES

The Sponsor series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived mostly from granite, gneiss, schist, and sandstone.  Sponsor soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sponsor loam, on a west facing, simple, 15 percent slope in aspen-fir woodland at an elevation of 9,000 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; organic layer of leaves, roots and twigs.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A1--1 to 7 inches; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    A2--7 to 12 inches; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) moist; weak, medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 25 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) cobbly clay loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 30 inches thick)

    Bt2--25 to 43 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) cobbly clay loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble, 5 percent stone; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 24 inches thick)

    Bt3--43 to 61 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very stony clay loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble, 25 percent stone; neutral (pH 6.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hourglass, Mult, and Wildcow series. In addition, the following series may be competitors when their classification is updated:  Buffork, Cific, Dra, Gebson, Lyonman, Michelson, Monida, Newlands, Passcreek, Primeaux, Rammel, Shotgun, Swede, Tripit, and Zade series.

Buffork, Cific, Tripit, and Zade soils: have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.
Dra, Mult, Newlands, Passcreek, Primeaux, Rammel, Shotgun, soils: have a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.
Gebson, Michelson, and Monida soils: have a horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.
Hourglass soils: have rock fragments of sandstone and limestone.
Lyonman soils:  formed in material derived from andesite or basalt.
Swede soils: have less than 15 percent (weighted average) rock fragments in the particle-size control section.
Wildcow soils:  are slightly alkaline and have hue yellower than 5YR in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived mostly from granite, gneiss, schist, and sandstone.
Landform:  mountain slopes.
Slopes:  15 to 45 percent
Elevation: 8,500 to 10,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  36 to 42 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  25 to 35 inches.
  Wettest months:  July and August receive slightly more precipitation than other months.
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, however the soils are still moist from snowmelt.
Frost-free period:  60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tuckerville and Clayburn series.
Tuckerville soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, and are on mountain slopes.  
Clayburn soils have thicker dark colored surface layers, and are on alluvial fans and toeslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, timber production, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of quaking aspen, Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, white fir, snowberry, aspen peavine, Thurber's fescue, needlegrass, mountain brome, western wheatgrass, and sedges (quaking aspen/mountain snowberry plant association).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.
