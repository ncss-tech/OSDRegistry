MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Whitman County, Washington; 1939

REMARKS:
The Staley series was previously classified as a Brunizem.

6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The location of this pedon is in an area of Palouse silt loam, 7 to 25 percent slopes. The nearest Staley map unit delineation is more than 5 km from this location. This pedon is on a south-facing loess ridge. The formatting of this OSD was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
