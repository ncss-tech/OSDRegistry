STANROD SERIES



The Stanrod series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately

slowly permeable soils that are formed in mixed alluvium.  They are on

coalesced fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The average

annual temperature is about 46 degrees F, the average annual

precipitation is about 10 inches.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Natrargids



TYPICAL PEDON:  Stanrod silt loam--rangeland.  On a 4 percent, single

slope, northeast aspect, 5,320 feet elevation.  The profile was moist

below 8 inches when described.  This profile was described June 24,

1982.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.

4/3) moist; weak very thick platy structure parting to moderate thin

platy; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores;

slightly effervescent; 5 percent pebbles; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8)

abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)



    Btn--3 to 6 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam,

strong fine angular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and very

plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and common

fine tubular pores; many thin and moderately thick clay films on faces

of peds and line pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth

boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)



    Btkn--6 to 8 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam,

pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure

parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; hard, friable, sticky

and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and common fine

tubular pores; strongly effervescent; few thin clay films on faces of

peds and line pores; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth

boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

6/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard,

very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine

and few fine roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores;

strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); clear smooth

boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)



    Bk2--11 to 17 inches; white (10YR 8/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR

6/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few

very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent;

very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12

inches thick)



    Bk3--17 to 30 inches; white (10YR 8/2) silt loam, very pale brown

and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few

fine tubular pores; 10 percent very hard and firm cicada krotovinas;

violently effervescent; violently effervescent lime segregated in few

fine irregularly shaped seams; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy

boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard and very

friable; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10

percent pebbles; common fine irregularly shaped soft masses and

filaments of salt; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4);

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series listed in the same

family.  Similar soils are the Antelope Springs and Mellor series.

These soils have a natric horizon with a lower boundary greater than 10

inches.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stanrod soils are on coalesced fan terraces.

Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4.700 to 5,600

feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium.  The average annual

precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches, the average annual air

temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F, and the frost-free season is

95 to 120 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darkbull, Declo, and

Mellor series.  These soils are on fan terraces.  Darkbull and Declo

soils do not have a natric horizon.  Mellor soils have a natric horizon

deeper than 10 inches.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Medium runoff.  Moderately

slowly permeable.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Stanrod soils are used for range and wildlife

habitat.  The native vegetation is shadscale, slatbush, and bottlebrush

squirreltail.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The soils of this series are not extensive in

Southern Idaho.
