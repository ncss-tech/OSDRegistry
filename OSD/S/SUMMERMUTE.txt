SUMMERMUTE SERIES

The Summermute series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone. Summermute soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Durinodic Haplocalcids

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Summermute soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,290 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Armespan, Jericho, Heist, and Timpie soils. Armespan soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. Jericho soils have duripans at 36 to 50 cm. Heist and Timpie soils do not have calcic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Summermute soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, rabbitbrush, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, sand dropseed, and galleta. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28A. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.
