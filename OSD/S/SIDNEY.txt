SIDNEY SERIES

The Sidney series consists of well drained soils on upland hillslopes.  They formed in loamy, calcareous residuum weathered from weakly cemented fine grain sandstone and are deep over weakly cemented calcareous fine grained sandstone.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sidney loam from a Sidney-Canyon complex on a 5 percent convex east- facing side slope in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Bk--41 to 66 centimeters (16 to 26 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common fine roots; violent effervescence; 2 percent by volume calcareous sandstone gravel; many mycelial-like threads and seams of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) thick)

  C--66 to 122 centimeters (26 to 48 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive, soft, very friable; few fine roots; strong effervescence; 5 percent by volume calcareous sandstone gravel; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  Cr--122 to 203 centimeters (48 to 80 inches); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) weakly cemented fine grained sandstone, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; violent effervescence, moderately alkaline.

Depth to paralithic contact: 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches), typically 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches)
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) 
Thickness of solum: 18 to 76 centimeters (7 to 30 inches) 
Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
Clay content: 5 to 20 percent
Sand content: 
Control section: silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam that generally averages less than 65 percent total sand and about 35 percent or less very fine sand.
Rock fragments:
Calcareous sandstone: typically less than 5 percent by volume but range from 0 to 15 percent 
Some pedons contain volcanic ash with glass shards that comprise from 20 to 80 percent by volume of the very fine sand and coarse silt. 
In some pedons, a few granitic pebbles are throughout the profile.

Creighton soils do not have bedrock above a depth of 60 inches and are on similar positions
Duroc soils deep, have pachic epipedons and are in swales
Rosebud soils have an argillic horizon, have sandstone at depths between 20 to 40 inches, and are on similar positions

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:   moderately high
Runoff: low on the gentle slopes to medium on the moderately steep slopes

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of the Sidney soils are cultivated. 
Some areas are irrigated with the rest in native grass and is used for range.  Winter wheat is the main dryland crop, corn and alfalfa are the irrigated crops.  
The native grasses are mainly needleandthread, blue grama and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nebraska and possibly adjacent areas of Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Banner County, Nebraska, 1989.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (the Ap horizon)  
Cambic horizon: 18 to 41 centimeters (7 inches to 16 inches) (the Bw horizon)

4/25/2000:PRF
Series taxonomy was modified from Torriorthentic Haplustolls to Aridic Calciustolls based on the lab data from two site.  A calcic horizon with a CaCO3 equivalent of >= 5% was found in both sets of data. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on pedon S87NE-007-34.

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
