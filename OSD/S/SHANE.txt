SHANE SERIES

The Shane series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from semiconsolidated clay shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shane silty clay loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; medium acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--12 to 18 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 9 to 20 inches.)

    Bk--18 to 36 inches; grayish brown and yellowish brown (10YR 5/2 and 5/4) clay loam, dark gray to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/1 to 4/6) moist; moderate medium platy structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many fine seams and soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 20 inches thick)

    Cr--36 to 60 inches; gray and yellowish brown (10YR 5/1 and 5/4) semiconsolidated shale with thin lenses of sandstone, dark grayish brown and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/2 and 4/4) moist; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains and hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Shane soils are used for nonirrigated cropland and rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, green needlegrass, and Columbia needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Shane soils are of moderate extent in southern and central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carbon County Area, Montana, 1971.  Type location moved from Cascade County to Chouteau County, Montana 1990.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0125, MT0128.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 12 inches (Ap and Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 7 to 18 inches with an abrupt textural increase (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); accumulation of lime from 18 to 36 inches (Bk horizon); a paralithic contact at 36 inches (Cr horizon).  Surface horizons may become cloddy when plowed and have evidence of bleached sand grains.  Shane soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
