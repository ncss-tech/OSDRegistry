SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska; 2020

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 0 to 100 cm
*Histic epipedon--zone from 0 to 40 cm
*Permafrost--Oef horizon
*Aquic conditions--zone from 25 to 100 cm
Soils are dominantly derived from sphagnum moss, but may contain sedge materials overlying mineral horizons at greater than 100 cm depth.
Some pedons have mineral horizons that occur below 100 cm.
