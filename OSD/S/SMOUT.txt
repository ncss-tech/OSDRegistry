SMOUT SERIES

The Smout series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  Smout soils are on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Torrifluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Smout gravelly loam -- on a 1 percent slope at 3,800 feet elevation in pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on July 3, 1990, the soil was dry from 0 to 10 inches and moist from 10 to 60 inches).

    A--0 to 7 inches;  grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    AC--7 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    C1--12 to 26 inches;  multicolored extremely gravelly sand; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations on coarse fragments; single grain; loose; common fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 75 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (11 to 14 inches thick)

    C2--26 to 60 inches;  multicolored extremely gravelly coarse sand; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations on coarse fragments; single grain; loose; many fine irregular pores; 65 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Borco series.  Borco soils are calcareous throughout the loamy material above the sand and gravel layer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Smout soils are on flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 3,700 to 5,100 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ajax, Bursteadt, Cowbone, Tohobit, and Zeegee soils.  Ajax soils are poorly drained and have fine-smectitic  particle-size control sections.  Bursteadt soils are moderately well drained, have a calcic horizon, and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Cowbone soils are poorly drained, have a calcic horizon and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Tohobit soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a calcic horizon.  Zeegee soils are poorly drained and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  All of these soils are on nearby landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Slow runoff.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  This soil floods occasionally for brief periods during January through June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated under irrigation for hay and pasture.  The principal native vegetation is streambank wheatgrass and black cottonwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
