SNOPOC SERIES

The Snopoc series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  These soils are on mountain side slopes commonly in concave pockets.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Snopoc very gravelly loamy coarse sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

(3 to 8 cm thick)

Behanin, Badhap, Behanco, Behanin, Bullrey, Dressel, Goodski, Hapgood, Lolon, Papaspila and Tonigut soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Belsac Croesus, Goodski, Nagitsy, Namela and Splitbutte soils have bedrock within 100 cm.  Boydhollow soils have Bk horizons with calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 15 percent. Busterback soils have 2.5YR and 5YR hues in the substratum and have profiles dominated by loam and sandy loam throughout and receive 400 to 480 mm of precipitation.  Poleline and Povey soils have more than 10 percent cobbles; more than 50 percent gravel sized fragments are 5 to 76 mm and sand fraction that is dominated by medium sand or finer.   Harcany soils have a mollic epipedon more than 76 cm thick.  Gateview, Hobacker and Lionhead soils have carbonates within 100 cm of the surface.  Marcetta soils have an albic horizon.  Nazaton and Parkcity soils have an udic soil moisture regime. Snacreek soils have C horizons that are strongly acid or moderately acid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Snopoc soils are on smooth to concave, north and east facing mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum derived from granite.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 2,560 to 3200 meters.  The climate is cold, continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.
