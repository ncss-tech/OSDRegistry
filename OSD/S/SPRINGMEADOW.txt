SPRINGMEADOW SERIES

The Springmeadow series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Springmeadow soils are on stream terraces and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Springmeadow soils are on flood plains and stream terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,050 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Holsine and Buster series. Both soils have calcic horizons. Holsine soils have 60 to 70 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section. Buster soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly to very poorly drained; medium to high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent high water table to the surface throughout the year. These soils are susceptible to very frequent flooding for long periods to occasional flooding for long periods in most years. Drained phases are recognized.

USE AND VEGETATION: Irrigated pasture and hayland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly tufted hairgrass, Nevada bluegrass, and sedge. This soil is correlated to ecological site R028AY072NV, Wet Meadow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to 20 cm (A horizon).
Redoximorphic features - The zone from 20 to 150 cm (Cg2 and Cg3 horizons).
Aquic conditions - The zone from the surface to 150 cm, conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features at certain times during normal years (A, Cg1, Cg2, and Cg3 horizons).
Fluvaquentic feature - An irregular decrease in organic matter between 40 and 150 cm (Cg2 and Cg3 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (parts of the Cg1 and Cg2 horizons).
