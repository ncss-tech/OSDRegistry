STABERG SERIES

The Staberg series consists of moderately deep, well drained  soils that formed in colluvium, and residuum from tuffaceous shale on hillsides and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Staberg loam--on a 10 percent slope at 5415 feet in fallow cropland. (Color is for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on July 31, 1987, the soil was dry to 10 inches and moist below.)

    Ap--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches)

    BA--10 to 23 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt--23 to 33 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; common fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 35 percent cobbles and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

    C--33 to 38 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very cobbly sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; hard,  friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 35 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Cr--38 inches; soft fractured tuffaceous shale.

TYPE LOCATION: Franklin County, Idaho; about 3 miles south and 3  miles west of Mink Creek, Idaho, about 1100 feet east and 800 feet north of the southwest corner of section 25, T. 14 S., R. 40 E.

chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist
texture - CBV-L, GRX-L, GRV-L, CBV-SIL

C Horizons:
hue - 10YR or 2.5Y

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bullump, Bullvaro, Camelback, Demner, Erig, Softscrabble, and Vipont.  The Bullump, Bullvaro, Camelback, Demner, Erig, and Softscrabble are all deeper than 40 inches.  The Vipont soils have more than 27 percent clay in the particle-control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Staberg soils are on hillsides and mountains at elevations of 4,600 to 6,000 feet.  They formed in  colluvium, and residuum from tuffaceous shale.  Slopes are  4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 19 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.  The frost free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kabear and Sanyon soils.  Kabear soils are on hillsides and are very deep.  Sanyon soils are on hillsides and are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Medium runoff.  Moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nonirrigated wheat and barley.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
