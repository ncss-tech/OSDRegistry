MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cecil County, Maryland, 1900 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 53 centimeters (21 inches) (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 53 to 102 centimeters (21 inches to 40 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Existing laboratory data show that soils sampled as Sassafras to include soils with a weighted average clay content in the argillic horizon that ranges from about 16 to 25 percent. Also, included are soils that have sand or loamy sand within 40 inches of the surface and border on a strongly contrasting family. The Sassafras series, however, is thought to be dominantly fine-loamy with a weighted average clay content of about 21 percent in the argillic horizon. 

Characterization data is available from the NSSL for the following pedons: 57DE001006.  Data for closely related Sassafras and Downer taxajuncts include the following pedons: 57DE001011; 59PA04501; 59PA045012; 74MD047001; 77MD029007; 79VA001001; 85NJ033010; 92DE003004; 93MD04768; 93NJ005001; 93NJ005002; 93DE003002. At, this time due to limited laboratory characterization data to support the present classification of the Sassafras series, a future 3-HAM MLRA Benchmark Sampling Project is planned.
