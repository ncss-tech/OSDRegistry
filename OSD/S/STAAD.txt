STAAD SERIES 

The Staad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, drainageways, and swales. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Staad silty clay loam, cultivated. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) 

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; few very fine tubular and many discontinuous pores; 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--6 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular and many discontinuous pores; 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw1--16 to 23 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine and many discontinuous pores; 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw2--23 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine, fine and medium discontinuous pores; 5 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Martinsdale series. Martinsdale soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. They have an argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon 7 to 16 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Staad soils are used mainly for dryland cropland, irrigated cropland, and range.  Potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, little bluestem, bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Staad soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA 44.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Deer Lodge County, Montana, 2003.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 16 inches (Ap and A2 horizons); a cambic horizon from 16 to 60 inches (Bw horizons); particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (part of the A2, Bw1 and part of the Bw2 horizons).  Staad soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
