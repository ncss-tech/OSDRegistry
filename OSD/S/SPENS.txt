SPENS SERIES

The Spens series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in glacial outwash and colluvial material of mixed mineralogy. Spens soils are on terrace escarpments, treads and kames. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Spens extremely gravelly loamy sand, range. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; 65 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

 C1--7 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose; common fine roots; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

 C2--17 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose; few fine roots; 65 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Atter, Carlsborg,  Marblespring and Valcreek series. Atter soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F. and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days. Carlsborg soils have Bw horizons and a solum depth greater than 10 inches thick. Marblespring soils are dominated by fine gravel in the particle-size control section, have E&Bt horizons and have a solum depth greater than 10 inches thick. Valcreek soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Spens soils are on outwash terraces, terrace escarpments, treads and kames. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent. The soils formed in gravelly glacial outwash of mixed mineralogy. Elevation ranges from 1,300 to 4,000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dart, Marble, and Springdale soils. Dart and Marble soils are sandy throughout and are on outwash terraces. Springdale soils have a cambic horizon and are on outwash terrace treads and risers.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; slow to medium runoff; very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for grazeable woodland, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is mainly widely spaced ponderosa pine with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, red threeawn, needleandthread, lupine, eriogonum and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. MLRA 43. The series is moderately extensive.
