SEAGRAVES SERIES

The Seagraves series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in recent sandy eolian deposits over loamy lacustrine deposits of Holocene and Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on the floor of playa basins that are 1.5 to 9 m (5 to 30 ft) below the surrounding plain and range in size from 5 acres to more than 20 acres. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F)

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained and slow permeability. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent. These soils are occasionally ponded for very brief to brief periods during some years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly cultivated to cotton and grain sorghum. Native vegetation is mainly short and mid grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate, with a smaller tall grass component. This site is dominated by blue grama with lesser amounts of sideoats grama, buffalograss, little bluestem, gaura, plains zinnia, prairieclover, bundleflower, wild alfalfa, and ephedra. Woody plants include catclaw sensitivebrier, yucca, and sand sagebrush. Dominant vegetation on the loamy fine sands includes sideoats grama, bluestems, and switchgrass, and on the fine sandy loams includes sideoats grama, blue grama, buffalograss, and Arizona cottontop. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy Loam (R077CY036TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is of minor extent.
