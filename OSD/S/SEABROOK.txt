     Cg--35 to 81 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sand; single grained; loose; few reddish ironstone nodules 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter at about 55 inches; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Hertford County, North Carolina; from Barretts Cross Roads, 2.2 miles southwest on U.S. Highway 258, 0.2 mile west on farm road and 200 feet northeast.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Horizon Thickness: Thickness of the sandy horizons is more than 72 inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 24 to 42 inches, December to March
Soil Reaction: extremely acid to slightly acid, unless limed 
Other Features: Silt plus clay in the particle size control section ranges from 5 to 20 percent; iron concretions 1/8 inch to 2 inches in diameter range from few to common throughout the profile; quartz gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent above 40 inches and from 0 to 35 percent below 40 inches; flakes of mica range from none to common throughout

A horizon:
Color-- hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4
Texture--loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand

C horizon: 
Color(upper part)--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8
Color(lower part)--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4
Texture--loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction; thin strata of brownish coated grains of sand are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons; streaks, lenses, and grains of uncoated sand range from few to many in the C horizon of some pedons.
Redoximorphic Features--iron masses in shades of yellow, brown, or red and iron depletions in shades of gray, olive, and brown

Cg horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture--loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction
Redoximorphic Features--iron masses in shades of yellow, brown, or red and iron depletions in shades of gray, olive, and brown

COMPETING SERIES:
