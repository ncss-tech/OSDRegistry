MAJOR USES: Most areas are farmed and used for corn, soybeans, small grains, and pasture.  Some areas are in urban uses and some are used for vegetables or hay.  

VEGETATION: Wooded areas consist of mixed hardwoods, dominated by oaks, sweet gum, red maple, and holly.

DISTRIBUTION: New Jersey and possibly Delaware and Maryland.

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Salem County, New Jersey, 1998.

REMARKS: Sharptown soils were previously mapped as a glauconitic inclusion with Mattapex soils.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric Epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 44 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and BC horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 20 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
