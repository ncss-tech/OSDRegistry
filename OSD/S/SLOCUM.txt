SLOCUM SERIES

The Slocum series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces and floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Slocum loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 14 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium crumb structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots and interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.9); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw--14 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; common fine brown stains around root channels; weak medium and coarse blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bg--24 to 33 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; many fine distinct brown redox concentrations; weak medium and coarse blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cg--33 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; water table at 33 inches; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    2Cg--60 to 65 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) very fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - low stream terraces and floodplains.
Elevation - 4,500 to 7,000 feet.
Parent material - noncalcareous alluvium from mixed sources.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short summers.
Mean annual precipitation - is 15 to 30 inches.
Mean annual temperature -  38 to 46 degrees F.
Mean annual summer temperature - 54 to 59 degrees F.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Slocum soils are used mainly for hay and pasture.  Potential native vegetation is mainly northern reedgrass, tufted hairgrass, basin wildrye, and some conifer and deciduous trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Slocum soils are widely distributed and inextensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Ravalli County (Bitteroot Valley area), Montana, 1952.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0245.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 14 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 14 to 33 inches (Bw, Bg horizons); a lithologic discontinuity at 60 inches (2Cg horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A, Bw, Bg, Cg horizons). Slocum soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.
