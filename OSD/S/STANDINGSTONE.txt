STANDINGSTONE SERIES

The Standingstone series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandstone colluvium over residuum derived from limestone. The Standingstone soils are on side slopes and toe slopes on the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau. Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1450 mm (57 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C. (57 degrees F.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Standingstone soils are on side slopes and toe slopes on the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau. Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. Elevation is 285 to 410 meters (935 to 1345 feet.) Most of this area formed in 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) of sandstone colluvium and is underlain by residuum weathered from Mississippian-age limestone. The mean annual precipitation in this area is 1397 to 1549 millimeters (55 to 59 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13 to 15 degrees C. (55 to 59 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Algood, Bouldin, Caneyville, Donahue, and Hayter soils. The Algood soils are fine-loamy.  Bouldin soils are loamy-skeletal. Caneyville soils are fine and are less than 100 cm (40 inches) to bedrock. Donahue soils are fine-loamy and average less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Hayter soils are fine-loamy and contain less clay in the lower part of the solum.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the underlying material. The potential for surface water runoff is very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are wooded.  Lesser sloping areas may be cleared and used for pasture. Native vegetation is mixed mesophytic hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 122-Highland Rim and Pennyroyal. Series extent is moderate. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES PROPOSED: White County, Tennessee 2011.  Standingstone is a local place name. 

REMARKS: The Standingstone was previously correlated as the Bledsoe series in parts of MLRA 122. These areas have been changed to Standingstone based on lab data.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 1 to 8 cm (0.4 to 3 inches) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 216 cm (6 to 85 inches) (Bt and 2Bt horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: 33 cm (13 inches)

Particle size control section: 15 to 100 cm (6 to 39 inches)

The representative component and horizon data is in DMU# 593215.
ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data on sample numbers 10TN185001 (typical pedon), 10TN133001, 10TN141002 is from the NSSL in Lincoln, NE.
