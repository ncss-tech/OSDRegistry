SIBLEYVILLE SERIES

The Sibleyville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and silty and sandy shale. These soils are on uplands. The mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Sibleyville loam - in grassland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  A1--0 to 18 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; a few small sandstone fragments; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 36 centimeters thick) 

  B2t--18 to 38 centimeters; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; thin clay films on faces of peds; few small sandstone fragments; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (20 to 51 centimeters thick) 

  C--38 to 69 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) channery loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable; moderately acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (10 to 41 centimeters thick) 

  Cr--69 to 152 centimeters; partially weathered yellowish brown fine grained sandstone. 

TYPE LOCATION: Douglas County, Kansas; six miles east of Baldwin; 800 feet west and 60 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 33, T. 14 S., R. 21 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 36 to 90 centimeters.
Depth to sandstone or sandy and silty shale ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters.
The mollic epipedon is 18 to 51 centimeters thick.
The solum contains 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments by volume that range from 2 mm to 8 centimeters in diameter. 
This soil is strongly acid to neutral throughout.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Atkinson, Burchard, Calmar, Cokato Cresco, Cresent, Durand, Friesland, Griswold, Hitt, Jasper, Joslin, Keosaqua, Kishwaukee, Marbletown, Moingona, Morrill, Nuxmaruhanixete, Pana, Parmod, Penfield, Reedslake, Ringwood, Rockton, Schoolcraft, Shelby,  Velma, and Winnebago series in the same family.
All the above series except Calmar and Rockton soils lack a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 100 centimeters. Calmar and Rockton soils are underlain by hard limestone at depths less than 100 centimeters. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material:  residuum weathered from sandstone and sandy and silty shale
Landform:  crest and side slopes of uplands
Slope:  1 to 12 percent
Mean annual temperature:  10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  76 to 102 centimeters
Thornthwaites Annual P E Index:  ranges from 54 to 68

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basehor, Elmont, Martin, Sogn, and Vinland soils. The shallow Basehor soils are on steeper slopes. Elmont soils are on similar positions as Sibleyville soils. They have shale at depths greater than 100 centimeters. The more clayey Martin soils are on lower side slopes. 
Sogn and Vinland soils are on similar positions, but are shallower to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage:  Well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:  moderately high to high

USE AND VEGETATION: Use is about evenly divided between cultivation and pasture. Crops grown are small grains, sorghums, soybeans, and corn. Pastures may be of tame or native grasses. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses and in some areas it has scattered oak and hickory trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Kansas; moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shawnee County, Kansas, May 1970. 
09/2008 GJJ added metric conversions, removed English units, and made some format changes.

10/2008 JCR Added clay, sand and rock fragments and reaction to the RIC based on the available NSSl lab data and pedon descriptions.
