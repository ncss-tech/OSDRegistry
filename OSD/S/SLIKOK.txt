Upper part of the A horizon: 8  to 20 percent organic matter, may be part of the histic epipedon
Base saturation (average): less than 50 percent (NH4OAC) in soils profile
Particle size control section: less than 15 percent fine sands or coarser, less than 18 percent clay
Surface cobbles and stones: may occur on the soil surface

O horizon:
Matrix color: value of 2 to4, chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: peat, mucky peat, muck
Reaction class: extremely acid to strongly acid

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: very poorly drained
Parent material: ash influenced, silty eolian, silty slope alluvium, or alluvial materials over firm alluvium and/or glacial till
Landform: floodplains, depressions till plains, and alluvial fans
Slopes: 0 to 8 percent, but are generally less than 2 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 28 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, high to very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the organic layers, moderately high to high in the solum, and moderately low to moderately high in the substratum. The water table is at or near the surface throughout the year. Flooding ranges from none to frequent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Natural vegetation is forest dominated by black spruce and willows with ground cover of moss, grass, horsetail, and sedges. A few areas are used for hay and pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
