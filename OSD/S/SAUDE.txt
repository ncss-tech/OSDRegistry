SAUDE SERIES

The Saude series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of stratified loamy alluvium and the underlying loamy sand and sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 875 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Saude loam, on a south-facing, slightly convex slope of about 1 percent, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 BA--33 to 41 centimeters; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, faces of a few peds very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few black (10YR 2/1) worm casts; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 centimeters thick)

 2BC--71 to 91 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand; single grain; loose; concentration of few rock fragments (2 to 75 millimeters in diameter) in upper part; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 40 centimeters thick)

 2C1--91 to 127 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 25 percent rock fragments (2 to 75 millimeters in diameter); moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 50 centimeters thick)

 2C2--127 to 152 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 20 percent rock fragments (2 to 75 millimeters in diameter); moderately acid.
