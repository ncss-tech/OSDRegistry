STEGALL SERIES

The Stegall series consist of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained and moderately slowly permeable above a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  These soils formed in loamy eolian sediments over a layer of indurated caliche which is underlain by loamy calcareous material derived from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.  They are on broad, smooth, nearly level to very gently sloping plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 457 mm (18 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Petrocalcic Paleustolls

(Combined thickness is 15 to 55 cm [6 to 22 in].)

   Bkkm--71 to 97 cm (28 to 38 in); indurated platy caliche; the upper 5 cm (2 in) is laminar, the upper surfaces of the plates are smooth, the lower surfaces have pendants of strongly cemented calcium carbonate up to 1 cm long; violently effrvescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (Thickness is 15 to 91 cm [6 to 36 in].)

   BCk--97 to 203 cm (38 to 80 in); reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) clay loam, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) moist; massive; hard, firm; about 50 percent calcium carbonate in the form of films, masses, and weakly cemented nodules; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 180 but less than 205 days, cumulative, in normal years.  October through March are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist April through September.
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F)
Depth to secondary carbonates: 51 to 64 cm (20 to 25 in)
Depth to petrocalcic horizon: 51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 in)
Solum thickness: 51 to 102 (20 to 40 in)
Particle-size control section: 35 to 60 percent silicate clay.

Bkm horizon: 
Ranges in thickness from 15 cm (6 in) to 1 m, and from strongly cemented to indurated in at least the upper 1 cm (1/2 in), and ranges from moderately to strongly cemented below.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Similar soils are the Arvana, Douro, Friona, Goliad, Lea, Sharvana, and Slaughter series.
Arvana and Douro series: have ochric epipedons and less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.
Friona and Lea series: have less than 35 percent clay in the control section. In addition, Lea series does not have an argillic horizon. 
Goliad series: is in the hyperthermic temperature regime. 
Slaughter and Sharvana series: are less than 51 cm (20 in) deep over indurated caliche. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy eolian sediments over a layer of indurated caliche which is underlain by loamy calcareous material derived from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.
Landform: broad, smooth, nearly level to very gently sloping plains.
Slopes: generally less than 1 percent but range to 3 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 cm (57 to 63 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 533 mm (17 to 21 in) 
Frost-free period: 185 to 220 days. 
Elevation: 762 to 1,311 m (2,500 to 4,300 ft).
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 19 to 28. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the similar Arvana, Lea, Olton, Sharvana, and Slaughter soils and the Kimbrough and Randall series. 
Arvana, Lea and Olton soils are all found on similar landscape positions. 
Randall soils are found only on the floor of playas. 
Sharvana soils are on slightly higher convex landscape positions. 
Kimbrough soils are found on similar landscape positions, do not have argillic horizons, and are less than 51 cm (20 in) deep over indurated caliche.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderately slow permeability above and below the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for cropland. Principal crops grown are cotton and grain sorghum and wheat. Climax vegetation is mainly short and mid grasses, with mid grasses tending to dominate. This site is dominated by blue grama and buffalograss with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa and prairieclover.. Woody plants include catclaw sensitivebrier and yucca. This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland (R077CY022TX) site in MLRA-77C.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains of west Texas and eastern New Mexico (sub-MLRA-77C). The soil is extensive.
