SEARVAR SERIES

The Searvar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Searvar soils are on plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Searvar gravelly loam--on a southwest facing slope under mountain big sagebrush, perennial grasses, and scattered western juniper, at an elevation of 5,480 feet--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on November 20, 1979, the soil was moist to 10 inches).

    R--53 inches; tuff-breccia; continuous, dense rock matrix that contains subrounded and angular fragments of andesite and basalt; difficult to chip with a shovel.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lassen County, California; about 15 miles south of Adin, 1.5 miles northeast of Silva Flat Reservoir, and 60 feet west of dirt road; 775 feet east and 400 feet south of the center of section 7, T. 36 N., R. 10 E.; USGS Said Valley 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from mid June to early November (about 120 to 140 days) and is moist in all parts from early December to early May. The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from mid March to mid November (225 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid May to early November; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.

Mean annual soil temperature - 47 to 51 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 10 to 20 inches, includes the Bt1 horizon.

Depth to base of argillic horizon - 20 to 40 inches.

Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered tuff-breccia or similar rocks.  Hard, unweathered bedrock is typically within 60 inches.

Control section - Clay content: 18 to 25 percent; Rock fragments: 35 to 50 percent, mostly cobbles.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as andesite.

Other features - Clay minerals are mainly montmorillonite and halloysite.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashue, Badena (T), Badenaugh, Eaglerock, Gitabyte (T), Grinrod, Ister, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Searles, Shawmount (T), Shree, Shroe, Trid, and Tristan series.

Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Shawmount, Shree, and Shroe soils are very deep.  Eaglerock soils have mainly fine pebbles in the particle-size control section and have paralithic materials of weathered granitic rock in the series control section.  Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, and Searles soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Trid soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and 55 to 75 percent pebbles in the particle-size control section and have paralithic materials of weathered granitic rock in the series control section.  Tristan soils are deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Searvar soils are on plateaus and hills.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff-breccia.  They typically occur on summit positions.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Total snowfall is 12 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Trojan, Erig, Jellycamp, and Longcreek soils.  Trojan soils are fine-loamy.  Erig soils are frigid and have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Jellycamp soils are clayey, shallow to duripans, and occur on summit positions of plateaus.  Longcreek soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow to lithic contacts, and occur on ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Searvar soils are used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, antelope bitterbrush, and scattered western juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 1,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 21.
