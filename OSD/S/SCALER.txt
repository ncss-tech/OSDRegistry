SCALER SERIES

The Scaler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed loess over residuum from schist and gneiss that are high in mica with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on structural benches, hills, mountain slopes and ridges.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: 

Bandmill soils:  have 3Btb horizons that have 25 to 40 percent clay and do not have mica flakes.

Riswold soils:  have 3Bt horizons that have 10 to 60 percent basalt fragments and do not have mica flakes.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scaler series are on structural benches, hills, mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 1800 to 4400 feet (549 to 1341 meters).  They have slopes from 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in loess over residuum weathered from schist and gneiss that are high in mica with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches (762 to 1397 mm).  The frost-free season is 50 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aldermand, Grandad and Kauder soils.  Aldermand soils are on canyons and mountain sideslopes and have a vitrandic surface.  Grandad soils are mountain sideslopes and ridge tops, have a thick mantle of volcanic ash and are paramicaceous.  Kauder soils are on structural benches and plateaus and are moderately deep to a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, Douglas fir, grand fir and western white pine with an understory of queencup beadlilly, goldthread, starry false Solomons seal, columbia brome and baldhip rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-Central Idaho; Scaler soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 43A.
