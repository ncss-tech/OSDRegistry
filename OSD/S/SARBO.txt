SARBO SERIES 

The Sarbo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  They have sands and gravel at moderate depths.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sarbo loam, irrigated grass hay (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bw1--12 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; common fine and medium, many very fine tubular pores; few worm casts; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bw2--23 to 33 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and many very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick) 

    2C--33 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; 35 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES: 

Bowdle (SD) - has a horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation, are calcareous in the sandy-skeletal horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - alluvial fans; stream terraces; glacial outwash plains. 
Elevation - 3,000 to 6,200 feet. 
Slope - 0 to 4 percent. 
Parent material - alluvium. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches. 
Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 44 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability in the fine-loamy material and rapid in the sandy-skeletal material. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sarbo soils are used mainly for irrigated cropland; some areas are used for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Columbia needlegrass, prairie junegrass, and forbs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Sarbo soils are of small extent in mountain valleys of western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County area, Montana, 1997. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT1481.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 23 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2, and 2C  horizons).  Sarbo soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
