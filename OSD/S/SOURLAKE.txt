SOURLAKE SERIES

The Sourlake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are meandering channels of creeks and streams.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).

Gist and Texla soils: have an argillic horizon; are on mounds of the Beaumont Formation

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: poorly drained. Runoff is high. Frequently flooded for brief to long periods in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of water oak, black maple, and green ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast, Texas from the Trinity River to the Sabine River; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 152B; the series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES PROPOSED: Hardin County, Texas, 2012, MLRA 152B Soil Survey Update, Texas, 2013. The name is coined from the city of Sour Lake in Hardin County, Texas.
 
REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Manco and Mantachie series. The Manco series is in MLRA 133B, at a higher elevation and in a shorter period frost free days. The Mantachie series is associated with the Southern Coastal Plain MLRA.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in). (A, Bw, Bg1 horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in). (A horizon) 
Aquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) 

Additional Comments: The mineralogy is assumed based on similar soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 5 pedons. KSSL data on S12TX1992414. This pedon is a taxadjunct to the series since this pedon has less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
