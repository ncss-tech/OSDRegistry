STROUPE SERIES

The Stroupe series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous and sandstone bedrock.  These moderately sloping to very steep soils are on mountain sideslopes and shoulder slopes.  Slope ranges from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Stroupe extremely stony loam--grassland.  (Colors are for dry
soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; about 60 percent cobbles, stones and gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 7 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) very stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate, fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable; few thin clay films on surfaces of peds; about 35 percent cobbles, stones and gravel; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) stony clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine prismatic structure parting to moderate, fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky, and plastic; many prominent clay films on surfaces of peds; about 30 percent cobbles, stones and gravel; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2--12 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely stony clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, slightly sticky and plastic; few small concretions and films of calcium carbonate on surfaces of peds; common distinct clay films on surfaces of peds and on rock fragments; about 70 percent stones, cobbles, and gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    C/Cr--20 to 30 inches; fractured igneous bedrock with material similar to horizon above in the cracks; slightly alkaline. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    R--30 inches; hard igneous bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goldust (NM),  Parquat (NM), Tafoya (NM), and Veldkamp (CO) series.  Similar soils are the Trock, Majada, Montosa, and Salas series.

Goldust, Parquat, and Veldkamp soils: do not have a lithic contact within 60 inches of the surface
Tafoya soils: have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches of the surface.
Trock, Majada, Montosa, and Salas soils: have a loamy-skeletal particle size family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: colluvium derived from igneous and sandstone bedrock
Landform: mountain sideslopes, footslopes and shoulder slopes
Slope: 5 to 70 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 50 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 20 inches
Frost-free period: 120 to 150 days
Elevation: 5,500 to 7,800 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Capillo,  Fuera, Laporte, Mirabal, Supervisor, and Witt series.  

Capillo soils: have a frigid temperature regime
Fuera soils: do not have a mollic epipedon and have a frigid temperature regime
Laporte soils: do not have an argillic horizon and have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface
Mirabal soil: do not have an argillic horizon and have a frigid temperature regime
Supervisor soils: have a cryic temperature regime
Witt soils: do not have a mollic epipedon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is high on 5 to 20 percent slopes and very high on slopes greater than 20 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for rangeland and recreation.  Sideoats grama, blue grama, cacti, yucca, pinyon pine, juniper and few ponderosa pine are present in the plant community.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Foothill of mountainous areas of New Mexico, Colorado, and possibly Wyoming, the series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona
