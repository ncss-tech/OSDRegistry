SUNHOFF SERIES


The Sunhoff series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra from Cinder Cone over till from volcanic rocks. Sunhoff soils are on moraines in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes range from 20 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches (686 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F (6 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial-skeletal, amorphic, frigid Typic Vitrixerands

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sunhoff soils are on lateral moraines and ground moraines on  glacial-valley walls. Slopes are 20 to 65 percent. These soils formed in tephra from Cinder Cone over till derived from volcanic rocks. Elevation is 5981 to 7602 feet (1823 to 2317 m). Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches (635 to 1143 mm). The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F (5 to 7 degrees C). Frost free season is 60 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buttelake and Talved soils. The Buttelake soils are deep to dense till and the Talved soils are very deep and formed in talus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is rapid in the A horizon, moderately rapid to rapid in the 2Ab and 2Bwb horizons, and slow to very slow in the 2Cd horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is California red fir, white fir, Jeffrey pine, pinemat manzanita and bush chinquapin.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B, Southern Cascade Mountains
