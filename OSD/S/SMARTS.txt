SMARTS SERIES

The Smarts series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that were formed in alluvium flood plains.  These soils are on steep to very steep coalescing alluvial-colluvial fans and mountain slopes and narrow alluvial flood plains. Slopes are 20 to 70 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Smarts silt loam, woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    01--2.5 to 0 inches; fresh to partially decomposed maple leaves. (O to 3 inches thick)

    All--0 to 15 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium granular structure that parts to very fine granules; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 22 inches thick)

    A12--15 to 22 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to weak medium granules; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 18 inches thick)

    B2t--22 to 49 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly heavy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak and moderate, medium and coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine subangular blocks; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common very fine and medium, few fine and coarse roots; common very fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 32 inches thick)

    C--49 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to very fine subangular blocks; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium roots; common very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Cache County, Utah; east side of Wellsville Mountain, southwest of Mendon, 200 feet south and 200 feet west of the E1/4 corner of sec. 19, T.11N., R.lW.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the Al and B2t horizons is 40 to more than 60 inches. Coarse fragments are mainly cobble and gravel size angular sandstone and quartzite rock fragments, ranging from about 5 to 45 percent in the Al horizon, and 35 to 85 percent in the B2t and C horizons. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at depth of 20 inches is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch depth for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer in 7 out of 10 years.

The Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 to 3. It has weak to moderate very fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky structure. It is neutral to strongly acid. This horizon is 20 to 40 inches thick. The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist, chroma of 2 through 5. It is very cobbly heavy loam or very cobbly light clay loam. This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky or weak prismatic structure. It is strongly acid to neutral. It has few to many thin clay films on peds and in pores.

The C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very cobbly loam to very cobbly sandy loam. This horizon has weak medium to fine subangular blocky structure or is massive. It is neutral or slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dateman, Elzinga, Hyrum, Poleline and Toncana series. Dateman soils have average summer temperature of less than 59 degrees F. Elzinga soils have albic horizons. Hyrum soils have mean annual temperatures of more than 47 degrees F. Poleline soils lack argillic horizons and have summer temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  Toncana soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the B2t horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Smarts soils occur on steep to very steep coalescing alluvial-colluvial fans and mountain slopes and narrow alluvial flood plains at elevations of 5,200 to 9,000 feet. Slopes are 20 to 70 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium, dominantly from sandstone, quartzite and limestone, but include some argillite, gneiss and schist. The climate is moist subhumid. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches, the mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 55 to 65 degrees F., and the frost free season is 60 to 90 days.

PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Elzinga and Poleline soils and the Bickmore, Broad Canyon, Despain, Durfee, Durst and Lucky Star soils. Bickmore and Despain soils have horizons of carbonate accumulation. Bickmore and Lucky Star soils have mean summer temperatures of less than 59 degrees F. Broad Canyon soils lack argillic horizons. Durfee soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Durst soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Lucky Star soils have albic horizons and mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as watershed. The native vegetation is maple, oakbrush, chokecherry, scattered aspen, snowberry, big sagebrush, Larkspur, false solomon's seal, fern, horsemint, peavine, western coneflower, blue wildrye, slender wheatgrass, cheatgrass and bearded wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountain areas of northern Utah. mis series is moderately extensive.
