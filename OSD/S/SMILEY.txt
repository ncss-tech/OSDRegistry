SMILEY SERIES 

The Smiley series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on lake plains, till plains and moraines. These soils have moderate or moderately slow permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 56 centimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Smiley sandy clay loam on a linear slightly convex slope on a glacial lake plain in a small grain field at 344 meters elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to carbonates range - 25 to 66 centimeters 
Thickness of mollic epipedon - 18 to 36 centimeters 
Argillic particle sizes - 18 to 35 percent clay and 25 to 45 percent sand
Rock fragments - 2 to 10 percent. Some pedons have lag lines less than 5 centimeters thick in the upper C horizon that contain up to 35 percent rock fragments
Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract - less than 2 mmhos/cm throughout the soil 

Typically, the depressional phase has an Oa horizon up to 20 centimeters thick that has textures similar to the A horizon but with mucky modifiers. 

Ap and A horizons:
Hue - 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral 
Value - 2 or 3
Chroma - 0 or 2
Texture - loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Reaction - slightly acid to slightly alkaline
Some pedons have an A1 horizon 5 to 15 centimeters in thickness

Btg horizon:
Hue - 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y 
Value - 3 to 5
Chroma - 1 to 3
Texture - clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam or silty clay loam 
Redoximorphic features - distinct or prominent present in the upper part where chroma is 2
Consistence - friable or firm.

Clay films - common or many, thin or moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and lining or filling pores are present in the upper part of the B horizon. Lower part of the B horizon has few or common thin and less commonly moderately thick clay films lining pores. The clay films have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2

COMPETING SERIES: These are in the Alamosa, Brandsvold and Friberg soils (it is assumed the Alamosa and Brandsvold series are competing, pending an update in the classification). Alamosa soils have an electrical conductivity that ranges from 2 to 16 mmhos/cm in the argillic horizon. Brandsvold and Friberg series have more than 45 percent fine sand or coarser in the argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - level and nearly level lake plains, till plains and moraines
Parent material - loamy calcareous till of Late Wisconsin Age
Slope - 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual air temperature - 2 to 6 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 64 centimeters
Frost-free days - 90 to 130
Elevation - above sea level ranges from 290 to 381 meters 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kratka, Hamre, Linveldt, Reiner and Roliss soils. 
Kratka -sandy over loamy and lack argillic horizons
Hamre - have a thin layer of organic material at the surface
Linveldt - are higher lying and have less clay in the argillic horizon
Reiner and Roliss - form a hydrosequence with Smiley soils
Reiner - are on higher positions with seasonal high water table deeper than 75 centimeters
Roliss - are lower lying and do not have an argillic horizon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class - poorly drained and very poorly drained
Runoff - negligible to low
Permeability - moderate or moderately slow
Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table - high as 15 to 46 centimeters at some time from April to July in most years for the poorly drained phase. It is at plus 30 to 15 centimeters from January to December for the depressional or very poorly drained phase 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most soils are cropped to small grains, sunflowers, and hay. Some are pastured. Native vegetation is mixed tall grass prairie and forest, mostly aspen. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Physiographic Division - Interior Plains
Physiographic Province - Central Lowland
Physiographic section - Western Lake section
MLRAs - Red River Valley of the North (56);
Northern Minnesota Gray Drift (57); 
Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
Extent - extensive

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pennington County, Minnesota, October 1981. 

REMARKS: 
Most of these soils were mapped with the Roliss soils, but are being separated because they have an argillic horizon. 
Diagnostic horizons and features:
Mollic epipedon - zone from surface to 30 centimeters (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - from 30 to 48 centimeters (Btg horizon)
Aquic moisture regime criteria - chroma less than 3, hue of 5Y and redoximorphic concentrations directly below the mollic epipedon (Btg horizon)
