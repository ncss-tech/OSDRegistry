SAWMILLCAN SERIES

The Sawmillcan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone and dolomitic limestone. The Sawmillcan soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Pachic Calciustolls

(Combined thickness of the ABk horizons is 35 to 60 centimeters thick)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sawmillcan soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone and dolomitic limestone. Elevations are 2,150 to 2,920 meters (7,050 to 9,580 feet). The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and common summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 320 to 420 millimeters ; mean annual air temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C., and the frost-free season 100 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Seralin and Hiddenforest soils on mountain backslopes. The Hiddenforest soils formed in quartzite parent material and have an argillic horizon. Seralin soils are shallow tolimestone bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for used for forest and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, white fir, black sagebrush, muttongrass and Indian paintbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
