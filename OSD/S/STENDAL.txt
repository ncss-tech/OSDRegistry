STENDAL SERIES

The Stendal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in acid, silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, acid, mesic Fluventic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Stendal silt loam, on a level area in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 168 meters (550 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; friable; common very fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bw--20 to 43 cm (8 to 17 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; common very fine roots; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) organic coatings on faces of peds; common fine  prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; few fine prominent spherical black (10YR 2/1) iron-manganese concretions; many medium prominent light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bg--43 to 102 cm (17 to 40 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; few very fine roots; few distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) organic coatings on vertical faces of peds; many medium distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and common prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common fine spherical and few medium irregular iron-manganese concretions; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. [36 to 71 cm (14 to 28 inches) thick]

 Cg--102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam; massive; firm; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) and common medium distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common medium irregular and few medium irregular iron-manganese concretions; very strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stendal soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Stendal soils formed in acid, silty alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1168 mm (38 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bonnie, Cuba, Haymond, Pope, Steff, and Wilbur soils. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Bonnie soils are on broad flood plains, and on backswamps. The well drained Cuba soils and the moderately well drained Steff soils are on higher lying flood-plain steps, and on natural levees. The well drained, less clayey Haymond soils and the moderately well drained, less clayey Wilbur soils are typically on lower lying flood-plain steps, and on natural levees. The well drained, more sandy Pope soils are typically on natural levees.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. In undrained areas, the depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. Duration of the intermittent apparent high water table is considerably less in drained areas. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate. This soil is subject to frequent to rare periods of flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for growing corn and soybeans. Some areas are in forest. Native vegetation is dominantly hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 114A, 114B, 115A, 120A, 120B, 120C, 122, 124, 125, 126, 128, and 129 in southern Indiana, south central Ohio, and Kentucky. The series is of large extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dubois County, Indiana, 1930.

REMARKS: This soil was reclassified (4/2001) as an inceptisol based on the Eighth Edition of the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy" and the presence of a cambic horizon in the majority of pedons. A clayey substratum phase is recognized, and will likely be proposed as a new series when subset surveys with this phase are updated. Stendal soils have an irregular decrease in organic-carbon content between a depth of 25 to 130 cm (10 to 50 inches).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the soil surface to 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from 20 to 102 cm (8 to 40 inches) (Bw, Bg horizons).
Redoximorphic features: from 20 to 152 cm (8 to 60 inches).
