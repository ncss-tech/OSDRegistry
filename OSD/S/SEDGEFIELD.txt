SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Orange County, North Carolina; 1975. 

REMARKS: Sedgefield was formerly included with the Helena series but is less acid and has higher base saturation. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 13 inches. 
Albic horizon - the zone from 7 to 13 inches below the surface. 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 13 to 33 inches below the surface. 
Features of Aquultic Hapludalfs - gray redox depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt1) and base saturation of 35 to 60 percent in the zone between depths of 37 and 65 inches.
