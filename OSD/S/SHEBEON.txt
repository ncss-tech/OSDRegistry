SHEBEON SERIES

The Shebeon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Shebeon soils formed in loamy till on wave-worked till plains, water-lain moraines, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aeric Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Shebeon loam, on 1 percent slope in a cultivated field on a till plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 28 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak coarse granular structure; friable; few fine roots; 1 percent gravel and cobbles; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

 Bt--28 to 43 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; few fine distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; 3 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 Btg--43 to 58 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 3 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 13 to 51 cm.)

 Cg--58 to 84 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; weak medium platy fragments; firm; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and few fine distinct brown (7.5YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; 3 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 38 cm thick)

 Cd1--84 to 124 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; moderate thick platy fragments; very firm; gray (10YR 6/1) faces of peds; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 3 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 Cd2--124 to 178 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; strong thick platy fragments; very firm; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) horizontal and some vertical faces of peds; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) coatings on other vertical and oblique faces of peds and fracture planes; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; 3 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Huron County, Michigan; about 3 miles north and 4 miles east of Bayport; 2,160 feet south and 510 feet west of the northeast corner of section 21, T. 17 N., R. 10 E. McKinley Township; USGS Caseville, Michigan topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 52 minutes 42 seconds N. and latitude 83 degrees 17 minutes 40 seconds W., WGS-84. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 28 to 66 cm
Depth to carbonates: 28 to 66 cm
Depth to densic contact: 61 to 102 cm

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, cobbly loam, cobbly sandy loam, or sandy loam, or less commonly loamy sand 
Rock fragment content: 1 to 14 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles
Reaction (pH): 6.6 to 7.8 

Some pedons have a B/E horizon. 

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Ped surfaces: have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: loam or clay loam
Rock fragment content: 2 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 8 percent cobbles
Reaction (pH): 6.6 to 7.8

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: loam or clay loam
Gravel content: 2 to 14 percent
Cobble content: 0 to 8 percent

Cd horizon:
Hue: similar to C horizon
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: loam
Gravel content: 2 to 14 percent
Cobble content: 0 to 8 percent
Special features: massive or pedon has medium or thick plates of geogenic origin; vertical or oblique fracture planes are observable in an exposed cut; fractures are at intervals of 30 to 91 cm.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aubbeenaubbee, Baugo, Crosier, Haskins, and Lamberjack series. Aubbeenaubbee, Baugo, and Lamberjack soils have sola thicker than 66 cm. Crosier soils do not have a C horizon above the Cd horizon. Haskins soils have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 100 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shebeon soils are on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 720 to 960 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C. Frost-free period is 135 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Shebeon soils are a part of a drainage sequence which includes the moderately well drained Grindstone soils and the poorly drained Kilmanagh soils. Badaxe and Avoca soils are nearby in some places where a thin sandy loam layer overlies the loam till.  Aubarque soils have less clay in the subsoil and are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low in the Cd horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are cultivated. Corn, beans, small grains, and sugar beets are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in the upper thumb of lower Michigan. The series is of large extent.
