SHUMWAY SERIES

The Shumway series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that were formed in alluvium from limestone and shale.  These soils are on nearly level or gently sloping alluvial valley bottoms.  The mean annual temperature is about 46.5 degrees.  The average annual temperature is about 10 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, carbonatic, mesic Vertic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Shumway silty clay loam - native pasture (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    All--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; very strongly calcareous, lime is disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    A12--3 to 13 inches; light gray (5Y 6/1) silty clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine pores; many fine and very fine roots; strongly calcareous, lime is disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    B2--13 to 25 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) silty clay, gray (5Y 5/1) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine pores; few fine and very fine roots; very strongly calcareous, lime is disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

    Clg--25 to 36 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) silty clay, gray (2.5Y 5/1) moist; massive; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine and very fine roots; very strongly calcareous, lime is disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    A13bg--36 to 40 inches; gray (2.5Y 5/1) silty clay, very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few very fine roots; very strongly calcareous, lime is disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. (O to 5 inches thick)

    C2g--40 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) clay, gray (2.5Y 5/1) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; very strongly calcareous, lime is disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Sanpete County, Utah; two miles north of Manti; on the west side of the R. R. tracks, 990 feet east and 900 feet north of the SW corner of sec. 30, T.17S., R.3E.

RANG IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils have low chroma or mottles within a depth of 20 inches. Organic matter either decreases irregularly with increasing depth or remains above .35 percent to a depth of 50 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch section averages 40 to 55 percent carbonates. Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. at depth of about 20 inches. Usually the soils are saturated within a depth of 40 inches unless drained, but dry out in the upper part each year and have cracks that are 20 inches deep and at least 3/8 of an inch wide. They are moderately to very strongly alkaline.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. The surface 4 inches has dry value of less than 5.5 and moist value of less than 3.5 in some pedons.

The B2 and C horizons have hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 1 or 2. They range from heavy silty clay loam to clay, but average silty clay with more than 35 percent clay.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abbott, Apishapa, Dyreng, and Quenzer series. All of these soils have less than 40 percent carbonate in the control section. Also, Quenzer soils do not crack to depth of 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Shumway soils are on nearly level or gently sloping alluvial valley bottoms at elevations of 5,100 to 5,700 feet.  They formed in alluvium from limestone and shale. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees  F.  Average annual precipita-tion ranges from 9 to 12 inches. Frost-free period is 110 to 130 days.

PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abcal, Anco, Ephraim, Kjar, Poganeab and Woodrow soils. Abcal, Anco, Woodrow and Poganeab soils have less than 40 percent carbonate in the control section. Anco, Ephraim and Woodrow soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section and lack cambic horizons. Kjar soils have histic epipedons. Poganeab soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Depth to water table ranges from 20 to 60 inches.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for pasture - both improved and native. Some are used for production of small grains and alfalfa. Dominant native vegetation is wiregrass, sedges, saltgrass, some native clovers, rabbitbrush, and yellowbrush.

DISTRIBUTION ANS EXTENT: Central Utah. The series is inextensive.
