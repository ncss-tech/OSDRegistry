Calhoun, Frost, and Gilbert soils are poorly drained, gray throughout, and are on lower landscape positions and the Gilbert soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the lower B horizon.
Feliciana soils are in higher positions on the landscape and well drained. 
Oprairie soils are on lower position on the landscape and have grayish ion depletions within the upper 25 centimeters (10 inches) of the top of the argillic horizon.
Deerford soils have a natric horizon.
