SARIA SERIES

The Saria series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces and meander scrolls. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Vertic Argiaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Saria peaty loam, in irrigated hayland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

	A--0 to 6 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) peaty loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 10 cm thick)

	Bt3--57 to 91 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; 15 percent medium prominent irregular dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist, masses of oxidized iron in matrix; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 40 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds and surfaces along root channels; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bt2, Bt3 -- 40 to 56 cm) 

	C1--91 to 119 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; 15 percent medium distinct irregular strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist, masses of oxidized iron on surfaces along pores; massive; hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; 30 percent pressure faces on all faces of peds; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

(combined thickness of C1, C2 -- greater than 60 cm)
