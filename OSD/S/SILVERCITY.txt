SILVERCITY SERIES

The Silvercity series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  They have extremely gravelly loamy sand at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on stream terraces and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Silvercity gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--6 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt2--10 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds and on coarse fragments; 35 percent pebbles and 15 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 25 inches thick)

    2Bk--24 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots in upper part; 40 percent pebbles and 25 percent cobbles; common distinct lime casts on underside of larger fragments; lime disseminated; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

COMPETING SERIES:

Beaverton (MT) - 10 to 20 inches to sandy-skeletal material.
Harol (UT) - does not have a 2Bk horizon.
Shirttail (SD) - has a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - stream terraces and dissected alluvial fans in mountain valleys.
Elevation - 4,000 to 5,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 4 percent.
Parent material - alluvium containing a high amount of coarse fragments.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; short summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 22 inches, most of which falls as snow and spring rain.
Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 80 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability in the loamy-skeletal material and rapid in the sandy-skeletal material.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Silvercity soils are used for rangeland and irrigated cropland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Columbia needlegrass, Richardson needlegrass, Idaho fescue, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Silvercity soils are of limited extent in mountain valleys of western Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1990.  Silvercity is a place name.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1257.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to a depth of 10 inches (A and Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 6 to 24 inches (Bt1 and B2t horizons); a sandy-skeletal 2Bk horizon from 24 to 60 inches; and a particle-size control section from the top of the argillic horizon to a depth of 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bk horizons).  Silvercity soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
