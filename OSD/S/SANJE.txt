SANJE SERIES

The Sanje series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium over very gravelly or extremely gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on terraces and fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy-skeletal, smectitic over mixed, superactive, frigid Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sanje clay loam, pasture land.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) heavy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; less than 5 percent pebbles; few cobbles and stones; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

    B21--13 to 30 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) light clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many fine pores and few medium pores; few thin very dark grayish brown organic films on faces of peds; 2 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear irregular boundary.

    B22--30 to 46 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) light clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many fine pores and few medium pores; 3 percent pebbles; few fine and medium masses of soft lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual irregular boundary.  (B2 horizon is 15 to 38 cm thick)

    B3ca--46 to 76 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) light clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many fine pores and few medium pores; 2 percent pebbles; many fine soft masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary.  (23 to 41 cm thick)

    IIC--76 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 60 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sanje soils are on terraces and fans.  Elevations are 670 to 1,370 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Sanje soils formed in calcareous clayey alluvium overlying very gravelly or extremely gravelly alluvium.  The climate is cool, with long cold winters, moist springs, and hot dry summers.  Mean annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.0 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is 250 to 355 mm, most of which falls during spring and early summer.  The growing season is 115 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ashuelot and Crago soils.  Ashuelot soils have a petrocalcic horizon.  Crago soils are loamy-skeletal in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; permeability is moderately slow above the extremely gravelly substratum and moderately rapid in the extremely gravelly substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sanje soils are used for dryland crops, pasture, and range- land.  The potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, blue grama, and forbs and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Montana; Sanje is moderately extensive.
