STYLITE SERIES

The Stylite series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous sediments.  These soils are on low ridges and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stylite fine sandy loam on a convex southeast-facing slope of two percent with native grass vegetation utilized for rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; few very fine discontinuous pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

      BA--2 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; few very fine discontinuous pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 or 3 inches thick)

      Bt--4 to 14 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium columnar structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; few fine and very fine discontinuous pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

      Btk--14 to 21 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium columnar structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; few very fine discontinuous pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; violently effervescent, carbonates disseminated and as common fine soft masses (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent by calcimeter); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

      Bk--21 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine discontinuous pores; violently effervescent, carbonates disseminated and as few fine soft masses (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

      Bky1--30 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine discontinuous pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates disseminated and as few fine soft masses; many (30 percent) fine and few (2 percent) medium soft masses of gypsum; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 24 inches thick)

      Bky2--40 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine discontinuous pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated and as few fine soft masses; many (30 percent) fine and common (5 percent) medium soft masses of gypsum; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).
