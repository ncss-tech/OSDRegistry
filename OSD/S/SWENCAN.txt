SWENCAN SERIES

The Swencan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and alluvium over basalt. Swencan soils have slopes of 0 to 12 percent and are on nearly level to rolling, wide, lava-filled valley floors. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Swencan fine sandy loam, located on a southwest facing slightly concave slope of 3 percent and elevation of 1,670 meters; when described on April 13, 1989, the soil was slightly moist throughout (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

 A1--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; very thick platy parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine to fine roots; common very fine to fine tubular pores; 1 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt smooth boundary

 A2--10 to 38 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine irregular and common very fine to fine tubular pores; 1 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary

 Bw1--38 to 58 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular and few very fine to fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary

 Bw2--58 to 76 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular and few very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary

 Bw3--76 to 81 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt irregular boundary

 2R--81 cm; vesicular basalt
