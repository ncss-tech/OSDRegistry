TYPICAL PEDON: Seastrand mucky peat under scattered western redcedar and Sitka spruce, on a level interdune at an elevation of 3 m (Textures are apparent field textures. When described, the soil was moist throughout.)

 Oe1--0 to 15 cm; mucky peat, black (10YR 2/1) broken face, rubbed and pressed, moist; weak fine granular structure; many fine and medium and common coarse roots; extremely acid (pH 3.8 in water); clear smooth boundary

 Oe2--15 to 38 cm; mucky peat, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) broken face and moist, black (10YR 2/1) rubbed and pressed, moist; weak thin platy structure; common fine and medium roots, few coarse roots; extremely acid (pH 4.0 in water); gradual smooth boundary

 Oe3--38 to 76 cm; mucky peat, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) broken face and moist, dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) rubbed and pressed, moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.0 in water); abrupt smooth boundary

 2Cg--76 to 150 cm; sand, gray (5Y 5/1) dry, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.0 in water)
