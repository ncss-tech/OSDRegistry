SIDDOWAY SERIES

The Siddoway series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits from mixed sources with some influence from underlying basalt.  Siddoway soils are on nearly level to steep slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Permeability is rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 85 days.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Siddoway loamy fine sand on a southwest-facing convex slope of 3 percent under sagebrush and grass at 5,140 feet elevation.  (On May 26, 1982, when described, the soil was moist throughout the profile.  Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loamy fine sand; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--5 to 19 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick)

    Bw--19 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--28 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (12 to 19 inches thick)

    Bk2--40 to 48 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 19 inches thick)

    Bk3--48 to 53 inches; white (10YR 8/2) loamy fine sand; pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; violent effervescence; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    2R--53 inches; basalt bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  The closely related Jipper soil has less than 75 percent sand in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Siddoway soils are on nearly level basalt plains to steep hills, at elevations of 5,000 feet to 6,100 feet.  Slopes are from 1 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in eolian deposits influenced by loess and slope alluvium from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches; the average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F; the average summer temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F; and the frost-free season ranges from 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jipper, Nayrib, Stipe, and Wolverine series.  The Jipper soils are mainly on nearly level basalt plains and have textures finer than loamy fine and.  Nayrib soils are mainly on or near rock outcrops and are very shallow over basalt.  Stipe soils are on rolling basalt plains and are less than 40 inches deep.  Wolverine soils are on stabilized dunes and lack mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Siddoway soils are used for range and wildlife habitat.  Principal vegetation is antelope bitterbrush, basin big sagebrush, needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, chokecherry, and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Siddoway soils are inextensive in southeastern Idaho.
