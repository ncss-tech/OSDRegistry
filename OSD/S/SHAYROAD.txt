SHAYROAD SERIES

The Shayroad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from granitoid.  Shayroad soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 18 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 520 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shayroad soils in an area of Shayroad sandy loam, 4 to 9 percent slopes at 2205 meters elevation in an orchard.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A1--0 to 9 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure and weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; clear smooth boundary.

     A2--9 to 26 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3), dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel; clear smooth boundary.

     A3--26 to 88 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; gradual smooth boundary.

     Bw--88 to 100 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel.

     C--100 to 150 centimeters; sandy loam; massive; friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel.
