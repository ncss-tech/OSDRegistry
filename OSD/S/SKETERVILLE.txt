REMARKS: 
The June 2024 revision changed the location of this series to mesic MLRA 136 from MLRA 148.  This was due to boundary line changes in the new Ag. Handbook 296.  
The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular.  No data was changed.
REVISED = 2/5/92, MHC; 0/2025, DTA
