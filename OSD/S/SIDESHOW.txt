SIDESHOW SERIES

The Sideshow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from shale.  Sideshow soils are on hills, alluvial fans, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON: Sideshow silty clay loam, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A-- 0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; many fine pores; slightly effervescent; 1 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    AB-- 3 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine discontinuous tubular pores; 1 cm wide cracks along ped faces; slightly effervescent; 1 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bss-- 6 to 25 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to strong coarse angular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots between peds; common fine tubular pores; intersecting slickensides; slightly effervescent; 1 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 inches thick)

    Bky--25 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots between peds; common fine discontinuous tubular pores; common fine and medium calcium carbonate threads, soft masses of lime and common fine and medium irregular masses of gypsum; slightly effervescent; 1 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).  

TYPE LOCATION: Montezuma County, Colorado; about 6 miles east of Cortez CO near the San Juan Basin Votech School; located about 2,350 feet east and 1,800 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 30, T. 36 N., R. 15 W.; Point Lookout, CO USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 21 minutes 7 seconds N. and long. 108 degrees 26 minutes 2 seconds W., NAD 27

Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 10 to 40 inches

Particle-size control section:
Clay content: 35 to 60 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6 (3 or 4 moist)
Chroma: 1 to 3
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent

B horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6 (3 or 5 moist)
Chroma: 2 to 6

Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline 

C horizon: (present in some pedons)
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Albers, Arboles, Dominguez, Ritoazul,  and Springerville series. Albers soils are noneffervescent above 30 inches. Dominguez soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. Pierre and Ritoazul soils are moderately deep. Sideshow soils have accumulations of secondary gypsum. Springerville soils are deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: alluvium and slope alluvium derived from shale
Landform: alluvial fans, hills, and terraces
Slopes: 0 to 40 percent
Elevation: 6,000 to 7,500 feet
Mean annual temperature: 46 to 50 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Zigzag and Ramper series.  Zigzag soils are located on knobs and hills and are shallow.  Ramper soils are on terraces and drainageways and are stratified.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, medium to very high runoff, slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Sideshow soils are used for grazing and dry cropland.  The native vegetation is western wheatgrass, big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of moderate extent.
