COMPETING SERIES: These are the McKinley, Pinguk, and Tisuk series. McKinley soils are moderately deep to bedrock series. Pinguk and Tisuk soils have a mean summer soil temperature less than 36 degrees F. (2 degrees C.).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: hills
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly colluvium
Elevation: 2,789 to 3,107 feet (850 to 947 m)
Slope: 40 to 70 percent
Annual precipitation: 23 to 27 inches (583 to 715 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Geist, and Schleyer soils. Geist soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, land occur on hills and outwash plains. Schleyer soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, and occur on hills, mountains, outwash plains, and terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is shrub birch-bog berry scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
