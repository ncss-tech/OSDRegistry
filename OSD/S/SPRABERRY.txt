SPRABERRY SERIES

The Spraberry series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow, well drained, and moderately permeable above a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Spraberry soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, thermic, shallow Ustalfic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Spraberry fine sandy loam, on a nearly level plain, 0.5 percent slopes in rangeland at an elevation of about 1,397 meters (4,585 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 9 cm (0 to 3 in); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots throughout; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 8 to 20 cm [3 to 8 in].)

   Bt--9 to 27 cm (3 to 10 in); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; few faint discontinuous clay films on ped surfaces; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (Thickness is 10 to 36 cm [4 to 14 in].)

   Bkkm--27 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in); pinkish white (5YR 8/2) indurated platy caliche; laminar in the upper 2 inches; undersides of plates have small pendants of calcium carbonate up to 1 cm in length; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (Thickness is 10 to 102 cm [4 to 40 in].)

   BCkk--51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in); white (10YR 8/1) gravelly loam, white (10YR 8/1) moist; massive; about 25 percent by volume gravel size calcium carbonate nodules that are strongly cemented; about 65 percent calcium carbonate by total volume as masses, nodules, and finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 205 but less than 270 days, cumulative, in normal years. November through April normally is the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in May through October.

Depth to petrocalcic horizon: 20 to 50 cm (8 to 20 in).
Particle-size control section: less than 30 percent silicate clay.
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in).

Blakeney, Kimbrough, and Simona soils: have mixed mineralogy and do not have an argillic horizon.
Douro and Kenhill soils: have a petrocalcic horizon between 50 and 100 cm (20 and 39 in) and have argillic horizons.
Eunice soils: do not have an argillic horizon.
Pojo soils: have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section, have a superactive cation exchange activity class and are dry in the soil moisture control section for slightly longer periods.
Sharvana soils: have mixed mineralogy and are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. 
Landform: nearly level to gently sloping plains.

Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 22 to 26.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the similar Douro and Eunice (NM) series and also the  Amarose (NM), Montoya and VestwellsTucumcari soils.
AmarosesVestwells soils: are on similar landscape positions and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.
Douro and Eunice soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Montoya and Tucumcari soils: are on lower landscape positions and formed in Triassic geology.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately permeable above and below the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. Surface runoff is medium on less than 1 percent slopes and high on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are almost exclusively used for rangeland. Climax vegetation includes sideoats grama, little bluestem, buffalograss, hairy grama, slim tridens, purple and wright threeawns, bushsunflower, gray goldaster, daleas, gayfeather, plains blackfoot, sundrops, catclaw, ephedra, hackberry, and javelinabush. This soil has been correlated to the Shallow (R077DY048TX) ecological site in MLRA-77D.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains of west Texas and eastern New 
Mexico (MLRA-77D). The series is of minor extent.
