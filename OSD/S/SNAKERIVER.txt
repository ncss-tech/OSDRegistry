TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic Typic Cryohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Snakeriver peat on a flood plain, on a slope of 0 percent at an elevation of 11 m (The soil was saturated throughout the profile when described on September 10, 2007.)

 Oi--0 to 40 cm; peat, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual wavy boundary

 Oe1--40 to 145 cm; mucky peat, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; many very fine and fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.3); diffuse wavy boundary

 Oe2--145 to 180 cm; mucky peat, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; common very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1)

TYPE LOCATION: Bethel Census Area, Alaska, about 50 km north of the village of Togiak; latitude 59.4925000 degrees north, longitude 160.6094444 degrees west, datum WGS 84 (coordinates determined with a GPS)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature--1 to 3 degrees C
