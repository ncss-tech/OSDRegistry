SUNEV SERIES

The Sunev series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep stream terraces or footslopes of valleys and ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 17 to 21 degrees C (62 to 69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 711 to 864 cm (28 to 34 in).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Guadalupe County, Texas; 1973. 

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with the Venus series. Classification was changed 11/89 from Typic Calciustolls to Udic Calciustolls.  Since the later establish ment of the Remley series, this series may need to be changed back to Typic Calciustolls. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) (Ap and A horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 30 to 183 cm (12 to 72 in) (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)
