SCOTT SERIES

The Scott series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in loess.  Scott soils are in closed depressions on loess uplands and stream terraces in the Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 millimeters (25 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Barbert, Crestmeade, Edina, Filbert, Fillmore, Massie, Sturges and Triplett series. 
Barbert soils allow for rock fragments in the series control section.
Crestmeade, Filbert, Fillmore, Sturges, and Triplett soils are somewhat poorly drained and do not pond water for long periods (7-30 days) during the growing season.
Massie soils are ponded for more than 45 consecutive days during the growing season.
Edina soils are poorly or very poorly drained but only pond water for brief periods during the growing season.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loess
Landform: closed depressions on loess uplands and loess-capped stream terraces
Slopes: 0 to1 percent
Elevation: 335 to 975 meters (1100 to 3200 feet) 
Mean annual temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C. (48 to 53 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 762 millimeters (20 to 30 inches)
Frost-free period: 142 to 173 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Butler, Fillmore, Massie, and Holdrege series. 
Butler soils on flat or slightly concave swales on uplands, do not have an albic horizon, and are somewhat poorly drained having saturation in the upper part of the solum for less than 7 consecutive days during the growing season.
Fillmore soils are on slightly higher landform positions of closed depressions, are somewhat poorly drained, and do not pond water for as long. 
Massie soils are in slightly lower positions of closed depressions and pond water for more than 45 consecutive days during the growing season.
Holdrege soils are on higher hillslopes and interfluves of uplands, do not have an albic horizon, have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and are well drained. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: poorly and very poorly
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: low
Saturation: a perched seasonal high water table fluctuates from around 15 cm above to 30 cm below the soil surface. 
Ponding frequency: frequent 
Ponding duration: long on the poorly drained soil with a depth of up to 30 centimeters (12 inches); very long on the very poorly drained soil with a depth of up to 61 centimeters (24 inches)           

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in pasture or wildlife habitat and used for livestock grazing and waterfowl. The plant community consists mainly of smartweed, curly dock, barnyard grass, plains coropsis, perennial bursage, sedges, and spikerush. Reed canarygrass has been seeded in some areas. The present rangeland ecological site is Clayey Overflow, (R075XY049NE) but Closed Depressions is being proposed. Minor use is cropping.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Primarily south central, central, and extreme north central Nebraska; LRRs H, G, and M; MLRAs 71, 73, 75, 66, 102C, and 106. The series is moderately extensive. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scott County, Kansas, 1910. The Scott series is no longer used in Kansas.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 86 centimeters (0 to 34 inches) (A, E, Bt horizons)
Albic horizon: 13 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) (E horizon)
Argillic horizon: 20 to 86 centimeters (8 to 34 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Linear extensibility: exceeds 6.0 between the surface and 100 centimeters (99 inches) 
The Scott, drained phase, is somewhat poorly drained and does not pond water but is saturated for long durations.
A terrace phase is recognized that has sand or coarse textured material below the loess cap at a depth of 3 to 9 meters (10 to 30 feet). 

01/2008 RRH: The Scott soils mapped in the aridic-ustic and udic moisture regimes may need to be recorrelated to the Lodgepole and Filbert series, respectively, or new series may be needed for very poorly drained soils. 

03/2006 LRM: metric conversion and changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity 

01/2008 RRH: Typical pedon: put moist colors first; Range of Characteristics, Bt horizon: added silty clay loam; Competing series: revised; Geographic Setting: revised, narrowed the mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature ranges; Geographically Associated Soils: revised, used only those soils at type location; Drainage: revised; Distribution and Extent: revised; Use and Vegetation: revised, plant community based on A Regional Guidebook for Applying the Hydrogeomorphic Approach to Assessing Wetland Functions of Rainwater Basin Depressional Wetlands in Nebraska, the component existing plants in NASIS is incorrect; Additional Data: revised

12/2011 DJK: Updated basic formatting to meet MO5 standards. On landform changed depressions to closed depressions. Edited MAP and MAAT in introduction. Added elevation to typical pedon.  Changed Lat/Long to proper location (old put in wrong section about a mile away). Extended C2 horizon on typical pedon to 200 cm. Added clay and sand contents to each horizon in RIC. For textures in RIC deleted loam for E, clay loam and silt loam for BC, and clay loam and loam for the C. Added silty clay as possible texture for BC. Added redoximorphic concentrations for Bt, BC, and C horizons in RIC. Updated the competing series section to better define differences. Added elevation to geomorphic setting. Edited geographically associated soils by eliminating Hastings and adding Massie. In drainage and saturated hydraulic conductivity eliminated occasional in ponding frequency an reworded saturation statement. In distribution and extent deleted the northwest part of northeast NE.

11/2021 PTC: Added wetland vegetation for Nebraska to ADDITIONAL DATA. Updated SSRO statement. Added Thickness to Range in Characteristics.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for Pedon IDs 77NE035001 and 79NE059007. Pedon ID 1978NE061020 represents the Typical Pedon and is in NASIS. 

In Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with: lesser duckweed (Lemna aequinoctialis), turion duckweed (L. turionifera) Herbaceous: river bulrush (Bolboschoenus fluviatilis), largespike spikerush (Eleocharis macrostachya), rice cutgrass (Leersia oryzoides), short-beak arrowhead (Sagittaria brevirostra), duck-potato arrowhead (S. cuneata), swamp smartweed (Persicaria coccinea), large-fruit burred , (Sparganium eurycarpum), narrowleaf cattail (TYPHA ANGUSTIFOLIA), broadleaf cattail (Typha latifolia).
