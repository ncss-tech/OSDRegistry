Directions to the Pedon:  (Jefferson National Forest, Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area); about 5837 meters (19,150 feet) southwest 215 degrees of the intersection of Highways VA-16 and VA-603, 1143 meters (3,750 feet) southeast of the gate at the "Scales".

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the fragipan: 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches).
Depth to bedrock:  More than 150 cm (60 inches).
Solum thickness:  Ranges from 64 to 150 cm or more (25 to 60 inches).
Depth Class:  Very Deep
Rock fragment content: Ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the O horizon, 20 to 90 percent by volume in the A, B, and C horizons, but averages 35 to 90 percent in the particle-size control section.
Rock fragments range from gravel to boulders in size. Typically, the amount of rock fragments increases with depth, and is generally more than 50 percent in the C horizon.
