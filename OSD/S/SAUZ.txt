SAUZ SERIES

The Sauz series consists of very deep; poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits derived from Holocene age sediments.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barrada, Lalinda, Mustang, Point Isabel, Saucel, and Willamar series.
Barrada soils: have a clay surface and are on wind tidal flats
Lalinda soils: have a sandy clay loam surface and are on dunes
Mustang soils: are sandy throughout and are on barrier flats
Point Isabel soils: have a clay loam surface and are on dunes
Saucel soils: do not have an argillic horizon and are on a similar positions
Willamar soils: has more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on a lower landform

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is high.  A seasonal water table occurs at depths of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) below the surface, which is perched above the argillic horizon after heavy rains. Rarely flooded due to surge from tropical storms.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Prairie type vegetation consists of cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, bushy sea-oxeye, purple lovegrass, seacoast bluestem, sacaton, and annuals.  The ecological site is Sandy Flat, PE 25-44 (R150BY708TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRS 150B in LRR T) on the gulf coast of southern Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Willacy County, Texas, 1980.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Willamar series. The series was revised to accurately reflect the laboratory report during the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation initiative in 2016. The surface texture was left as a loamy fine sand as the delineation this site is in was correlated to a loamy fine sand phase. In addition, the previous version had incorrect geocoordinates to the type location.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 18 to 69 cm (7 to 27 in). (Btnz1 and Btnz2 horizon)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in). (A horizon)
Natric horizon: 18 to 102 cm (7 to 40 in). (Btnz1, Btnz2, and Btknz horizons)
Aquic conditions: 0 to 102 cm (0 to 40 in) of saturation and reducing conditions

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL data from Brooks County, TX (S79TX-047-002) and from Willacy County, TX (S79TX-489-001).
