BA--2 to 9 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through medium roots; 5 percent subrounded quartz gravels and subangular phyllite channers; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

Bt1--9 to 16 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.
