SAYERS SERIES

The Sayers series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium.  The soils are in nearly level to gently undulating flood plains along streams and rivers.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Typic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sayers fine sandy loam--rangeland.
                (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark
brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard,
friable; few fine roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6
to 40 inches thick)

     IIC1--10 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; few thin
strata of brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 48 inches thick)

     IIC2--24 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose, very friable; many very
pale brown (10YR 7/3) strata below 42 inches; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Bastrop County, Texas; about 1.7 miles north of
the intersection of Farm Road 2336 and Texas Highway 95 along
Texas Highway 95; then 1.8 miles southwest on county road and 350 feet southeast into bottomland area of Big Sandy Creek.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are medium acid through
mildly alkaline in all horizons.

The A horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), dark brown
(10YR 4/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or
light brown (7.5YR 6/4).  It is loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.

The IIC horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), dark brown
(10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), or light brown (7.5YR 6/4).  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand that may contain alternating strata of fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy
clay loam that are slightly darker and are presumed to contain
more organic matter.  Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly 2 to 10 percent.  Some pedons contain up to
15 percent by volume of waterworn pebbles and cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bruno, Corlena, Gracemore,
Kiomatia, Lincoln, Orif, Pulaski, and Zalla series.  Bruno and Kiomatia soils are moist for longer periods of time in the
moisture control section.  Corlena soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 59 degrees F.  Gracemore soils have a water table at depths of less than 40 inches most of the year.  Lincoln
and Orif soils are calcareous in the 10- to 40-inch control
section.  In addition, Orif soils contain more than 35 percent
coarse fragments and more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Pulaski soils
have average textures finer than loamy fine sand in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Zalla soils have mean annual soil temperatures more than 72 degrees F. and are calcareous.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sayers soils are in nearly level to gently undulating flood plains along streams and rivers.  The soil formed
in alluvium.  Slope gradients are mostly less than 1 percent but range up to 3 percent.  The climate is subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual
temperature is 60 degrees to 70 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices are 38 to 60.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arenosa, Patilo, Silstid, Tabor, and Uhland series.  Arenosa, Patilo, and Silstid soils are upland soils with siliceous mineralogy.  Tabor soils are upland soils with clayey Bt horizons.  Uhland soils occur in
similar positions but have coarse-loamy 10- to 40-inch control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid to rapid permeability.  The water table
is at depths of 5 to 15 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly as range; a few areas are in tame pastures.  The vegetation is tall grasses with a 10 to 50 percent canopy of elm, cottonwood, oak, and willow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Texas and southern Oklahoma.
The soil is extensive.
