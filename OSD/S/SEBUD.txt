SEBUD SERIES

The Sebud series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till, outwash, alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, till plains, moraines, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Sebud loam, with 3 percent surface stones and boulders, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear boundary.

    A2--4 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist coatings; moderate fine and medium blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; 10 percent gravel and cobbles, 40 percent stones and 1 percent boulders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 horizons - 10 to 16 inches)

    Bw1--10 to 22 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very stony clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist coatings; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; 10 percent gravel and cobbles, 40 percent stones and 1 percent boulders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bw2--22 to 28 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very stony coarse sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; 5 percent gravel and cobbles, 40 percent stones and 1 percent boulders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual boundary.

    Bw3--28 to 49 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very stony coarse sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many clear quartz sand grains, 5 percent gravel and cobbles, 40 percent stones and 1 percent boulders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual boundary.

    Bw4--49 to 62 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very stony clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and cobbles, 40 percent stones and 1 percent boulders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
