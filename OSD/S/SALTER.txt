SALTER SERIES

The Salter series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy deposits on stream terraces, outwash plains, and glacial lake basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Salter loamy sand - on a 4 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 247 meters (810 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

	Bw1--23 to 36 cm (9 to 14 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [10 to 15 cm  (4 to 6 inches) thick]

	Bw2--36 to 53 cm (14 to 21 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 31 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick]

	C--53 to 152 cm (21 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified silt, fine sand, and very fine sand; massive; friable; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Jefferson County, Wisconsin; about 1/2 mile northwest of Palmyra; 1,200 feet north and 530 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 15, T. 5 N., R. 16 E. USGS Palmyra Wisconsin Quadrangle; latitude ? 42 degrees 53 minutes 21 seconds N., and longitude ? 88 degrees 35 minutes 56 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the base of soil development: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Rock fragments: absent throughout the pedon
Particle-size control section:  averages 8 to 18 percent clay, 15 to 70 percent fine sand or coarser
Reaction:  moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part of the solum, neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part
Special features: at least part of the profile above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) stratified

Ap horizon: 
Hue: 10YR

Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand

E horizon (where present):
Hue: 10YR

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 4 to 8
Texture: silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand, some pedons with thin strata of fine sand or very fine sand 

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6
Textures: silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand, stratification a common feature

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Galaway, Nellis, and Sunburg series. Galaway soils have a lithic contact between 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) depth. Nellis, and Sunburg soils do not have stratification of textures and have rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Salter soils are on stream terraces, outwash plains, and glacial lake basins. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Salter soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 889 mm (28 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Sisson soils and the Colwood, Keowns, Kibbie, and Yahara soils. In some nearby areas on similar landscape positions and in similar deposits, the Salter soils are in association with the fine-loamy, well drained Sisson, somewhat poorly drained Kibbie, and poorly drained Colwood soils. The poorly drained Keowns and the somewhat poorly drained Yahara soils are in a drainage sequence with the Salter soils in other landscape situations. Keowns soils have grayer subsoil colors and Yahara soils have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from low to high.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Cleared areas are used for cropland. Common crops are small grain, corn, hay and some vegetable crops, such as cabbage, peas, and green beans. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 95B in south-central parts of Wisconsin. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Columbia County, Wisconsin, 1972.

REMARKS: 
Most of the correlated acres of this series are outside the range in characteristics because they do not have carbonates. Only the 465 well drained acres correlated in Jefferson County have carbonates.

4731 well drained acres are correlated in Columbia County without carbonates.

2850 moderately well drained acres [redox at 97 cm (38 inches)] are correlated in Dane County without carbonates. In addition, these acres are a mollic intergrade.

290 moderately well drained acres [redox at 107 cm (42 inches)] are correlated in Waushara County without carbonates.

In addition, there are 2180 acres correlated in Shawano County as Salter Variant because they have an argillic horizon (classify as frigid Haplic Glossudalf). These acres have carbonates. All correlated acres should probably be checked for 
an argillic horizon.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon -  
0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); cambic horizon - 23 to 53 cm (9 to 21 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).
