SEARLES SERIES

The Searles series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from rhyolite and basalt. Searles soils are on uplands, mountains, and lava plains.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Searvar, Shawmount, Shree, Shroe, Trid, and Tristan series. 

Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Shawmount, Shree, Shroe, and Tristan soils do not have bedrock within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Eaglerock, Searvar and Trid soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 50 to 100 cm from the soil surface.  Gitabyte soils have mollic epipedons that are 18 to 25 cm thick.  Grinrod soils cannot be adequately separated (see remarks).  Ister soils have an O horizon and average 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Searles soils are on south-facing slopes of uplands, mountains, and lava plains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolite or basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Elevations range from 610 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 380 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C.The frost-free period is 50 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ayres, Deschutes, Holmzie, Simas, and Statz soils.  Ayres soils have ochric epipedons and duripans.  Deschutes soils do not have an argillic horizon and are coarse-loamy.  Simas soils have a clayey argillic horizon and have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Statz soils have a duripan at depths of 25 to 50 cm and are non-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Searles soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The potential native plants are bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Sandberg's bluegrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, basin big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and western juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Oregon, west-central Idaho, northwestern California, Nevada, and Utah.  The series is extensive.  MLRAs 10, 23, 25, and 26.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Crook County (Prineville Area), Oregon, 1964.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 46 cm (A, AB, and Bt1 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 64 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 100 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 64 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

The Grinrod series (WA) is an established soil and will need further investigation during an MLRA update to determine its series differentia when compared with the Searles soil. Grinrod is of moderate extent and mapped throughout central Washington within MLRA 8. It appears that soil climatic differences may be present in the Grinrod soil in addition to the influence of loess and volcanic ash (St. Helens). Within the Searles series, the use of a C horizon which may or may not be present in addition to carbonate accumulation on undersides of some rock fragments within this horizon, does not provide adequate competing differentia.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data on 1 profile (S55 Oreg. 7-7 and 1-7) reported in Riverside Soil Survey Laboratory report for soil sampled in Prineville Area, Crook and Jefferson Counties, Oregon, 1955. Organic carbon data believed not to be reliable. (Too high in the lower B and C horizon.)
