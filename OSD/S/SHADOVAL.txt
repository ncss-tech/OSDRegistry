SHADOVAL SERIES

The Shadoval series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from lacustrine deposits. Shadoval soils are on foothills and have slopes of 4 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Natrixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Shadoval silt loam -- on a 11 percent convex west-northwest facing slope at 2,940 feet elevation in rangeland. When described on August 9, 1995, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Pawtoot (T) and Susanville series. Pawtoot soils are very deep to a paralithic contact. Susanville soils are very deep, dry for more than 160 consecutive days following the summer solstice, have carbonates at 26 to 44 inches, and lack a gypsic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shadoval soils are on hill backslopes and summits and have slopes of 4 to 50 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from lacustrine deposits. The elevation ranges from 2,700 to 3,300 feet. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches and average annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Polecat and competing Pawtoot soils. Polecat soils are deep to a paralithic contact, are fine-silty and occur on the same landform as the Shadovalsoils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Shadoval soils are used mainly for rangeland. Natural vegetation is basin big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ada County, Idaho. MLRA 10. The soils are of limited extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to 10 inches (A, BA and Bt horizons)
Abrupt textural change - at 4 inches with a 21 percent clay increase within 1 inch (upper boundary of Bt horizon)
Natric horizon - zone from 4 to 15 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons)
Gypsic horizon - zone from 32 to 39 inches (Bkny2 horizon)
Paralithic contact - at 39 inches (Crky horizon)
Linear extensibility - 6.0 cm or more from the soil surface to the paralithic contact
Particle-size control section - zone from 4 to 15 inches (Bt and Btk horizons)
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering xeric
These soils are drier than other Xerolls in the region under similar precipitation due to early runoff and extended period of high evapotranspiration.
