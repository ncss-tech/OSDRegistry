SPLITLIMB SERIES

The Splitlimb series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands.  They formed in loess and silty slope alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland divides and in sinkholes.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON: Splitlimb silt loam - on an east facing concave ridgetop of 2 percent slope in a pasture at an elevation of 1,305 feet (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 10 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate very fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; many fine irregular and common fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.7); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

   Bt1--10 to 15 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine roots; many fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; few fine faint brown (10YR 5/3) masses of iron accumulation; strongly acid (pH 5.1); clear smooth boundary.

   Bt2--15 to 20 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine roots; many fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; common fine distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.

   Bt3--20 to 25 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; strong medium platy structure; firm; few very fine roots; common fine tubular and few medium vesicular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; common prominent black (N 2/0) masses of iron and manganese oxides accumulations on surfaces of peds; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.

   Bt4--25 to 34 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) and brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam; moderate medium platy structure; firm; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; common fine prominent gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; common prominent black (N 2/0) masses of iron and manganese oxide accumulation on surfaces of peds; very strongly acid (pH 4.7); gradual smooth boundary.

   2Bt5--34 to 60 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; firm; many very fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; common fine prominent gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; very strongly acid (pH 4.7).  (combined thickness of the Bt and 2Bt horizons is more than 50 inches)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Splitlimb soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland divides and in large sinkhole basins.  They formed in loess and silty slope alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Branson, Lowassie, Tonti, and Viburnum soils.  Branson soils are well drained and are on similar landscape positions.  Lowassie soils are clayey, poorly drained and are on similar positions. Tonti soils have a fragipan and are on broad ridgetops. Viburnum soils are clayey, moderately well drained and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is negligible to low. Permeability is moderate, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  In undisturbed areas a perched water table has an upper limit of 1 to 2.5 feet during December to April in most years.  In depressional areas, these soils are subject to ponding.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks Highland region (MLRA 116A) of southern Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Texas County, Missouri soil survey; 2002.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches. (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 60 inches.(Bt and 2Bt horizons)
Zone of aquic conditions - 15 to 60 inches.
In most areas this soil is thought to be derived from Peoria loess deposited over Loveland loess and slope wash deposits.
