STODICK SERIES

The Stodick series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and material weathered from softly consolidated sedimentary rocks.  The Stodick soils are on foothills and have 4 to 50 percent slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stodick fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 2 percent boulders, 15 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles and 35 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones and 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky, and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; faint clay films on faces of peds, and coating and bridging mineral grains; a few bleached sand grains at the top of horizon; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    Bt2--13 to 25 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine angular and subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky, and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine, and few medium and coarse roots in the upper portion of horizon, with roots following ped surfaces; very few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; few distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

    2Bt--25 to 46 cm; pale olive (5Y 6/3) very gravelly loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm and friable, moderately sticky, and moderately plastic; many fine,very fine and few medium roots; few fine tubular pores; few faint dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay films in pores, coating gravel and bridges between mineral grains; 40 percent gravel; 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 cm thick)

    2Cr--46 to 61 cm; gray (5Y 6/1) weathered conglomerate, olive (5Y 4/3) moist; parts to thick plates; thick discontinuous clay films along cleavage planes.  The horizon consists of softly consolidated tuff and conglomerate with visible crystals of mica, hornblende and quartz sand grains.

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Nevada; about 6 miles northeast of Minden; near the northeast corner of sec. 35, T. 14 N., R. 20 E.; USGS McTarnahan Hill 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 2 minutes 29 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 41 minutes 47 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.0413889 latitude, -119.6963889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry but are moist in the winter and spring months; aridic soils moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to base of argillic: 36 to 50 cm.
Depth to paralithic contact: 36 to 50 cm.      

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 25 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent with 35 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to l5 percent cobbles.

A horizon 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3.  

Bt horizons
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture: Averages loam or clay loam.
Structure: Weak to strong fine or medium angular or subangular blocky

2Bt horizon
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y.
Other features: Colors are largely lithochromic.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abalan, Alcan, Armoine, Berit, Bouncer, Entero, Flex Ginex, Harvan, Penelas, Ravenell, Sedsked, Soar and Zyzzi series.  

Abalan and Ginex soils have secondary carbonates. Alcan, Armoine, and Bouncer soils have 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Berit, Flex, Penelas, Ravenell, Sedsked, and Soar soils have paralithic contacts less than 36 cm. Entero and Zyzzi soils are moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer months.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stodick soils are on foothills at elevations of 1,465 to 1,620 meters.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and residuum derived from softly consolidated sedimentary rocks (Truckee and Coal Valley Formations).  The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 200 to 250 mm.  The average annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 95 to ll0 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Haybourne, McFaul and Toll soils.  Haybourne and McFaul soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Toll soils have sandy particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing during winter and spring months.  Vegetation is principally black sagebrush, needlegrass, horsebrush, spiny hopsage, and ephedra.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  Stodick soils are of small extent. MLRA 26.
