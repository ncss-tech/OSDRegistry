SUWANEE SERIES

The Suwanee series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale on valley floors, flood plains, stream terrace, and alluvial fans. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches.

TYPE LOCATION: Valencia County, New Mexico; about 4 miles south of Highway 6, U.S. Interstate 40 Intersection, about 1,320 feet east and 1,056 feet north of the southwest corner of section 19, T. 8 N., R. 3 W.; 107 degrees, 10 minutes, 50 seconds west longitude; 34 degrees, 54 minutes, 00 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section is moist in some part, periodically, during the peak moisture period of July, August and September and is dry in all parts of the majority of the time during April, May and June. It is dry in all parts 50 to 75 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. Ustic aridic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 47 to 57 degrees F.

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 7.5YR.
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 to 6.
Texture: silty loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam, or clay.

C horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 3 to 6.
Texture: Stratified silty clay to loamy fine sand.
Clay content: weighted average is 18 to 35 percent.
Reaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Barnum (WY), Hamburn (NM), Haverdad (WY), Haversid T(CO), Manikan (AZ), Panitchen (CO) and San Mateo (NM) series. 
Barnum soils have a mean annual soil temperature range of 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil moisture control section is moist in some part of the majority of the time during the peak moisture period of April, May and June. 
Hamburn, Haversid, and San Mateo soils have hues of 10YR or yellower. 
Haverdad soils have a mean annual soil temperature range of 48 to 53 degrees F. and are moist for 60 consecutive days in spring and early summer. 
Manikan soils have calcium carbonate accumulations. 
Panitchen soils have gypsum accumulations.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Suwanee soils are on valley floors, flood plains and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevation is 4,300 to 6,500 feet. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F. mean annual precipitation is typically 5 to 10 inches but ranges to 12 inches. Areas with low precipitation receive an additional 2 to 5 inches of additional run-on moisture from summer flooding. Frost-free period is 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bond, Hagerman, Mack, Navajo, and Shiprock series. The Bond, Hagerman, Mack and Shiprock soils have argillic horizons. Navajo soils are fine textured.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid to slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing. Present vegetation is alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, western wheatgrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico and southeastern Utah. The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
