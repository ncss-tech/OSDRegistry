STONE SERIES

The Stone series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till or lacustrine material, poorly sorted outwash, local drift, and occasionally in the underlying residuum from limestone. These soils are on outwash terraces, outwash plains, and abandoned stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Stone silty clay loam, on a slope of less than 1 percent in corn stubble at an elevation of 277 meters (909 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium and fine roots; 2 percent igneous and limestone cobbles and chert gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 inches) thick]

 2BC--51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) very gravelly silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; very few very fine roots; common medium distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) iron depletions with diffuse boundaries in the matrix; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; 20 percent limestone gravel; 10 percent limestone cobbles; 5 percent limestone channers; 10 percent completely weathered limestone gravel; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [13 to 38 cm (5 to 15 inches) thick]

 2C--76 to 107 cm (30 to 42 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly loam; massive; friable; common medium distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) iron depletions with diffuse boundaries in the matrix; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; 30 percent limestone cobbles; 20 percent limestone gravel; 5 percent shale gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 51 cm (5 to 20 inches) thick]

 3R--107 cm (42 inches); highly fractured limestone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arkton, Crippin, Floyd, Fostoria, Kensett, Merton, Nicollet, Normania, Ottosen, Readlyn, Snider, Walnut Grove (T), and Wilmonton series. Arkton, Crippin, Floyd, Fostoria, Merton, Nicollet, Normania, Ottosen, Readlyn, Snider, Walnut Grove, and Wilmonton soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Kensett soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stone soils are on footslopes on outwash terraces, outwash plains, and abandoned stream terraces of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in till or lacustrine material, poorly sorted outwash of high calcium carbonate content, and local drift occasionally mixed with the underlying residuum from limestone. Rock fragments are mainly limestone, crystalline, and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1067 mm (31 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blount, Glynwood, Leoni, Milton, Pewamo, and Scioto soils. The very deep Blount, the very deep, moderately well drained Glynwood, the moderately deep, well drained Milton, and the very deep, very poorly drained Pewamo soils are on adjacent till plains. The well drained Leoni soils are on adjacent kames and eskers. The well drained Scioto soils are on adjacent outwash terraces, kames, and eskers.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent water table ranges from 15 to 30 cm (0.5 to 1 foot) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. The rarely flooded phase is subject to flooding from late fall to spring. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately high or high in the lower part. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and small grains are the principal crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Ohio; MLRA 111B. The series is of small extent, with about 1,000 acres.

REMARKS: The Stone series has previously been mapped as Millsdale and Westland soils in Delaware County.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 76 cm (Bw, 2BC horizons).
