SAMBRITO SERIES

The Sambrito series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick acid gravelly moderately coarse textured materials derived mainly from sedimentary rocks. Sambrito soils are on moderately to steeply sloping ridges, mountain sides, and valley side slopes and have slopes of 4 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:   Sambrito loam - forest (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed organic material principally needles, bark, twigs, and the fleshy remains of grasses.

    Oe--3 to 6 cm; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above.

    A--6 to 16 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine granular and crumb structure; soft, very friable, nonplastic, nonsticky; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw--16 to 57 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonplastic, nonsticky; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (18 to 58 cm thick)

    C--57 to 157 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonplastic, nonsticky; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (71 to 127 cm thick)

    2Cr--157 cm; shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Azwell, Bobtail, Hanks, Jenkins, Jughandle, Lake Janee, Liggett, Ryorp, and Ualters series.  Azwell, Bobtail, Jenkins, Jughandle, and Ryorp soils have a lithic contact above depth of 100 cm.  Hanks soils have sandy-skeletal substratums above depth of 100 cm and are in areas of winter rainfall.  Lake Janee soils are medium or strongly acid, contain a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand, and have a winter rainfall pattern.  Liggett soils are strongly or very strongly acid, have Bw horizons in which some clay is accumulating as lamellae, and have a winter rainfall pattern.  Walters soils developed in stratified alluvium that is more silty in the upper control section, have continuous horizons of visible carbonate accumulation, and have a continuous E horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform--moderately to steeply sloping ridges, mountain sides, and valley side slopes
Elevation--2850 meters
Slope--4 to 80 percent
Parent material--colluvium over residuum derived mainly from sedimentary rocks
Mean annual precipitation--890 mm to 1020 mm
Mean annual air temperature--3 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--12 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, summer wildlife habitat, and some summer cattle range.  Native vegetation is mainly spruce and fir with an understory of shrubs and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Sambrito soils are moderately extensive in the high mountain areas of western Colorado, northern Utah, and southeastern Idaho; MLRAs 43B, 47 and 48A.
