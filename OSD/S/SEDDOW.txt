SEDDOW SERIES 

The Seddow series consists of deep well drained soils on hills on basalt plateaus and structural benches in canyons. They formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over material weathered from basalt. Slope ranges from 3 to 50 percent. The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Seddow soils are on hills on basalt plateaus and structural benches in canyons. Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent. These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over material weathered from basalt. Elevations are 1,100 to 5,300 feet. Average annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches, average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the frost free period is 80 to 125 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cramont, Culdesac, and Zaza series. Cramont soils have less than 10 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, and are on ridgetops. Culdesac soils have a horizon of andic material greater than 14 inches thick, and are on north and east-facing hill sides. Zaza soils are shallow and are on convex hill sides. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate to rapid runoff; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production and livestock grazing. Native vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, longtube twinflower, and common snowberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho; MLRAs 9 and 43A. This soil is of small extent.
