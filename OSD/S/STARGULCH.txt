STARGULCH SERIES 

The Stargulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that have a high component of volcanic ash in the surface layers and formed in glaciofluvial deposits or alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces in valleys. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Andic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stargulch ashy very fine sandy loam, forested (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw1--4 to 10 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) ashy very fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium and common coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bw2--10 to 15 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) ashy very fine sandy loam, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    2E and Bt1--15 to 27 inches; E part (90 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry, Bt part (10 percent) is dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam lamellae, 1/4 to 3/8 inch thick, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick) 

    2E and Bt2--27 to 46 inches; E part (70 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); Bt part (30 percent) is dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) 1 to 2 inch thick fine sandy loam lamellae, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many clay films bridging sand grains; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 24 inches thick) 

    2Bt and E--46 to 60 inches; Bt part (60 percent) is dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) 1 to 2 inch thick very fine sandy loam lamellae, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many clay films bridging sand grains; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); E part (70 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8).
