SOUTHCAT SERIES

The Southcat series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Southcat soils are on beach plains. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Sodic Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Southcat gravelly loamy sand--on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 1,330 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 13 cm thick) 

    Bn3--48 to 66 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; 2 percent fine gravel; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary.

(0 to 23 cm thick) 

    2C2--104 to 157 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine interstitial pores; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6). 

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Oregon; about 8 miles north of the village of Paisley and east of the dune field bordering Summer Lake; approximately 2,150 feet south and 1,800 feet east of the northwest corner of section 15, T. 32 S., R. 18 E.; USGS Loco Lake 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 47 minutes 44 seconds N and longitude 120 degrees 34 minutes 34 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 2 to 6 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Bienfait series. Bienfait soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during the summer. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Southcat soils are on beach plains. These soils formed in eolian material and wave-reworked alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. Elevations range from 1,275 to 1,570 meters. The climate is arid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Kewake soil. Kewake soils are sandy throughout the particle-size control section, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and are on dunes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Southcat soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The historic plant community is shadscale, bud sagebrush, black greasewood, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
