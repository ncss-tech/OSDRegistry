STRUGGLE SERIES

The Struggle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till from granitic rocks.  Struggle soils are on moraines.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Xeric Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Struggle gravelly sandy loam--on a 20 percent northwest-facing slope in woodland at 2225 meters elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on August 19, 1986, the soil was dry throughout.)

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Custer-Lemhi County, Idaho, 1999. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon--4 to 14 cm (A and AB horizons)
Cambic horizon--14 to 50 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Particle-size control section--25 to 100 cm (part of the Bw1, the Bw2, the BC, the C1, and part of the C2 horizons)

Classification changed from Sandy-skeletal, mixed Xeric Eutrocryepts to Sandy-skeletal, mixed Xeric Haplocryepts due to the revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. 3/2008
