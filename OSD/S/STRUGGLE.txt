STRUGGLE SERIES 

The Struggle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till from granitic rocks.  Struggle soils are on moraines.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 5 to 35 per cent.  The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Underdown series. Underdown soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 30 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Struggle soils are on Pinedale glacial moraines and formed in glacial till dominantly from granite. Slopes are 5 to 35 percent and elevations are 6,600 to 8,000 feet.  The climate  is cold and moist in winter and spring and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches.  Average annual temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 5 to 30  days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Busterback, Castlepeak, Langer, and Yankeefork soils.  Busterback soils are on stream terraces and outwash fans.  They have mollic epipedons and loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Castlepeak soils are on outwash fans, fan terraces and stream terraces.  Castlepeak soils are excessively drained, lack cambic horizons and receive  12 to 16 inches of precipitation.  Langer soils are on mountains and have mollic epipedons.  Yankeefork soils are on outwash fans, fan terraces and stream terraces.  Yankeefork soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and receive 16 to 20 inches of precipitation. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow or medium runoff. Moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland.  The vegetation is lodgepole pine and elk sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Custer-Lemhi County, Idaho, 1999. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (A ad AB horizons) 

Cambic horizon - The zone from 4 to 18 inches (the Bw horizons). 

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bw1, the Bw2, the BC, the C1, and part of the C2 horizons). 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Sandy-skeletal, mixed Xeric Eutrocryepts to Sandy-skeletal, mixed Xeric Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
