SHORIM SERIES

The Shorim series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum from igneous rock flows with a component of calcareous eolian material. Shorim soils are on footslopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shorim very gravelly sandy loam, rangeland.  The soil surface is covered with 80 percent rock fragments, mainly pebbles.

    A1--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate coarse platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots, many fine and medium vesicular and few very fine tubular pores; 50 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine vesicular, and common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--10 to 21 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, few very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 40 percent pebbles; common thick lime coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Bqkm--21 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silica-lime cemented hardpan, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; indurated laminar cap. (1 to 5 inches thick.)

    R--24 inches; extremely hard basalt bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; 1,600 feet south and 2,600 feet east of the projected northwest corner of Section 11, T. 14 S., R. 48 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry.  The upper part of the moisture control section is moist for a very short time in late winter.

Soil temperature - 64 to 70 degrees F.

Depth to duripan - 20 to 38 inches.

Depth to bedrock - 21 to 40 inches.


Control section - Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, mainly pebbles.

Clay content:  5 to 15 percent.


A horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4.


Bk horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Chroma:  3 or 4.

Texture of fine earth:  Fine sandy loam, sandy loam and coarse sandy loam.

Reaction:  Strongly  alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

Duripan:  Continuous laminar cap directly on top of hard bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Skelon (NV) series.  Skelon soils have a thick duripan over unconsolidated alluvium.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shorim soils are on footslopes of hills and formed from igneous rock flows.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is warm and arid.  Distribution of precipitation is relatively even with slight peaks in January and August.  Mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Akela, Arizo and Canutio soils.  The Akela soils lack a duripan and are shallow to bedrock. Arizo and Canutio soils are very deep soils in drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability above the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, desertholly, creosotebush, ephedra, and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  The soils are not extensive.   MLRA 30.
