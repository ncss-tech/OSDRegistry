STROLE SERIES

The Strole series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine deposits of calcareous silty clay or clay on glacial lakebeds. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C  (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, illitic, mesic Aquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Strole silt loam, on a convex, nearly level slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 199 meters (652 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 cm (6 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium and coarse granular structure; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate coarse granular and moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 43 cm (10 to 17 inches).]

 Bt--30 to 41 cm (12 to 16 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; very firm; plastic; many distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay films on faces of peds; few faint organic stains; few medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Btg--41 to 76 cm (16 to 30 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay; moderate coarse and very coarse angular blocky structure; very firm; many prominent very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay films on faces of peds; common distinct organic stains; common medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; moderately acid in upper part changing gradually to neutral in the lower part; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt or Btg horizon is 33 to 58 cm (13 to 23 inches).]

 Cg--76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay; massive; very firm; thin lenses and layers of fine sand and silt loam; many medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6 and 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 C--152 to 183 cm (60 to 72 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam; massive; very firm; light gray (10YR 7/1) calcium carbonate coatings on bedding plains; many medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 C'g--183 to 203 cm (72 to 80 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; massive; firm; light gray (10YR 7/1) calcium carbonate coatings on bedding plains; many medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Newton County, Indiana; about 1 mile east of Foresman; 200 feet south and 400 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 24, T. 28 N., R. 8 W.; USGS Goodland topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 51 minutes 54.9 seconds N. and long. 87 degrees 17 minutes 8.7 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 475916 easting and 4523841 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 45 to 60 percent clay
Series control section: silty clay or clay textures predominate; rock fragments are not present

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam, or less commonly loam
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

A thin AB horizon is present in some pedons.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: silty clay or clay
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

Btg horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2
Texture: silty clay or clay
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline

C or Cg horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam; thin strata of silt loam, loam, or fine sand may be present
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chenoa, Clarence, Elliott, and Martinton series. Chenoa, Elliott, and Martinton soils have less than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Clarence soils have high bulk density till that is root and water restrictive within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Strole soils are on glacial lakebeds of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Strole soils formed in lacustrine deposits of calcareous silty clay or clay. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 381 meters (600 to 1,250 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Darroch, Foresman, Jasper, Montgomery, and Rensselaer soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Montgomery and Rensselaer soils are in concave positions. The somewhat poorly drained Darroch soils and the moderately well drained Foresman soils are fine-loamy and are on swells. The well drained Jasper soils are fine-loamy and are on nearly level to gently rolling positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are cropped to corn, soybeans, and small grain. Native vegetation is prairie grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 110 and 111C in northwestern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 inches) (Bt, Btg horizons).

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 155004 represents the typical pedon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (NW7301, Soil No. S73IN56-1) from the Purdue University Soil Characterization Lab, AES Bulletin No. 174, Vol. 2, Pgs. 229-300. Transect data (T98IN-111-001) is on file in MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 90 percent Strole and 10 percent Montgomery soils.
