SOELBERG SERIES  

The Soelberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that  formed in lacustrine sediments over flood deposited sand and gravel.  Soelberg soils are on terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow in the  upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 12  percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the  average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calciargidic Argixerolls  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Soelberg loam-- on a 1 percent east facing slope at  5,400 feet elevation in hayland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless  otherwise noted.  When described on August 17, 1988, the soil was dry  throughout.)  

    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3)  moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable,  slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots;  many very fine irregular pores; 3 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH  7.4); clear smooth boundary.  

    A2--3 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3)  moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard,  friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine  and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of  the A horizons is 10 to 12 inches)  

    Bt1--10 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to  moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine  tubular and irregular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds  and lining pores; 1 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy  boundary.  

    Bt2--17 to 28 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark  yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure  parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, firm,  slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium  roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces  of peds and lining pores; 3 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH  8.1); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 10 to 20 inches)  

    Bk--28 to 36 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) gravelly loam, pale  brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; hard, firm,  slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very  fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; prominent  lime coatings on all sides of coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 inches  thick)  

    2Bkq--36 to 40 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loamy  coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky  structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few  very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 60 percent  gravel, 5 percent cobbles; many prominent lime and silica coatings on  coarse fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8);  gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches)  

    2Bq--40 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sand, dark  brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard,  friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine  irregular pores; 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; many prominent  silica coatings on coarse fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Soelberg soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0  to 12 percent.  The soils formed in lacustrine sediments over flood  deposited sand and gravel.  Elevations are 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  The  climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches.  Average annual  temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atomic, Lesbut,  Techick, and Splittop soils.  Atomic and Splittop soils are on  basalt plains and lack mollic epipedons.  Lesbut and Soelberg soils are  on terraces.  Lesbut soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Techick soils are deep to sand and gravel.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Slow to medium runoff.  Moderately slow permeability in the upper part and very rapid  permeability in the lower part.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and cropland.  Native vegetation is  Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not  extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Butte County Area, Idaho, 1997.  

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (A1 and A2  horizons)  

Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 28 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)  

Calcic horizon -  the zone from 28 to 36 inches (Bk and Bkq horizons)  

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2,  Bk and 2Bqk horizons) because the argillic horizon is less than 20 inches thick and contrasting material is below the argillic horizon but with 40 inches of the surface.
