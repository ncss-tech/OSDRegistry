SHERM SERIES

The Sherm series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping eolian plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).
