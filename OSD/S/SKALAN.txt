SKALAN SERIES

The Skalan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from gneiss and other related metamorphic rocks with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Skalan soils are on rolling to very steep uplands and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Melder and Southpac series. Melder soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Southpac soils are very deep and formed in andesite parent material. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skalan soils are on slopes of 5 to 65 percent. Elevations range from 2,100 to 3,500 feet. The soils are on all aspects at lower elevations and mainly on south and west slopes at the higher elevations. Skalan soils formed in material weathered from gneiss and other related metamorphic rocks, with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 27 inches. The mean January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 66 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kruse, Lenz, Molly, Moscow, Schumacher, Spokane, Ulricher, and Vassar soils. Kruse and Schumacher soils are fine-loamy and are on mountain and foothill side slopes. Lenz and Spokane soils do not have argillic horizons and are on mountain and foothill side slopes. Moscow and Ulricher soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Moscow soils are on foot slopes, back slopes, and ridges of mountains. Ulricher soils are on mountains. Molly and Vassar soils have contrasting particle-size control sections. Molly soils are on rolling to very steep mountain side slopes. Vassar soils are on mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for grazing and timber production. The native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, bluebunch wheatgrass, snowberry and other short shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountainous uplands in Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington. MLRA 43A. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kootenai County, Idaho; 1976. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
Ochric epipedon the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Oi, Oe and A horizons). 
Argillic horizon the zone from 10 to 20 inches (Bt2 and Bt3 horizons) with the zone from 5 to 10 inches (Bt1 horizon) containing oriented clay, however, failing to meet the 20 percent increase in clay accumulation from the horizon above. 
Vitrandic feature the zone from 2 to 10 inches 
Ultic feature the zone from 10 to 30 inches having an assumed base saturation (sum) of less than 75 percent in one or more horizons. 
Lithic feature the zone beginning at 32 inches 
Particle-size control section the zone from 10 to 20 inches 

Classification revised 03/03 from loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs to loamy-skeletal, isotic Vitrandic Haploxeralfs 

Skalan soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).
