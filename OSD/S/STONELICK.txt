STONELICK SERIES

The Stonelick series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous stratified alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Stonelick sandy loam, in a cultivated field on the flood plain of the East Fork of the Little Miami River at an elevation of 183 meters (600 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [15 to 36 cm (6 to 14 inches) thick]

 C1--30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand; single grain; loose; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick)]

 C2--46 to 71 cm (18 to 28 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 C3--71 to 127 cm (28 to 50 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 C4--127 to 178 cm (50 to 70 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; massive; very friable; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Clermont County, Ohio; about 2.2 miles south-southeast of Batavia, in Batavia Township; 100 feet east of the East Fork of Little Miami River and 1/4 mile west of Elk Lick Road; USGS Batavia, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 03 minutes 9.133 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 10 minutes 24.12 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Series control section:
Rock fragment content: 0 to 14 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and all horizons typically have carbonates

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 (6 or 7 dry); may be 3 or 4 (5 or 6 dry) in some thin A horizons
Chroma: 2 to 4; may be 1 or 2 in some thin A horizons
Texture: sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loamy fine sand

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: stratified with dominant textures of loam, sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sand, or loamy sand; loamy sand comprises a total thickness of 38 cm (15 inches) or less within the particle-size control section

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carr, Rocher, and Stringley series. Carr and Rocher soils have particle-size control sections in which the sand is dominantly fine sand or very fine sand, respectively. In addition, Carr soils have a drier moisture regime borderline to ustic. Stringley soils have 15 percent or more gravel in the lower part of the series control section and have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 183 cm (6 feet).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Stonelick soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in calcareous stratified alluvium that has its source in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 210 days. Elevation is 160 to 235 meters (525 to 770 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eel, Genesee, Gessie, Landes, Lanier, Medway, Ross, Shoals, Sligo, and Sloan soils. Eel, Medway, and Sligo soils are moderately well drained and are in slightly lower positions. Genesee, Gessie, and Ross soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and are on slightly higher positions. Landes and Lanier soils have mollic epipedons and are on similar landscapes. Shoals soils are somewhat poorly drained and Sloan soils are very poorly drained and are in depressional areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table is greater than 6 feet. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid. This soil is subject to occasional or frequent flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: The Stonelick soils are used for farming, including permanent pasture, and for woodland. Principal crops are corn, wheat, oats, and meadow. Native vegetation is deciduous forest with beech, elm, sycamore, ash, oak, and maple as principal species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern and south-central Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois; MLRAs 108A, 110, 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D, 111E, 114A, 114B, 115A, 121, and 124. The type location is in MLRA 114A. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clermont County, Ohio, 1972.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap horizon).

A gravelly substratum phase and a very gravelly substratum phase are currently recognized and will be correlated to a different series as these soils are updated during MLRA activities.
