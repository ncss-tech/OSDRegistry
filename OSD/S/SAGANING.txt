SAGANING SERIES

The Saganing series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in a thin layer of loamy material and the underlying sandy material on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Aeric Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Saganing sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope in a pasture area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy loam; weak medium granular structure; very friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bg1--20 to 33 cm (8 to 13 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam; weak thin platy structure; very friable; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bg2--33 to 61 cm (13 to 24 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 inches) thick]

 C--61 to 152 cm (24 to 60 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) sand; single grain; loose; common medium faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) masses of oxidized iron; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Arenac County, Michigan; 3 miles east of Arenac; 810 feet east and 525 feet north of the center of sec. 31, T. 19 N., R. 6 E.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Moosilauke series. Moosilauke soils are more acid than neutral in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Saganing soils are on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Saganing soils formed in formed in a thin layer of loamy material and the underlying sandy material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Saganing soils are closely associated in a drainage sequence with the somewhat excessively drained Karlin soils. Deford and Roscommon soils are common associates.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is negligible. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils are in permanent pasture or forest. Some areas are under cultivation to legume-grass hay and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northern Lower Michigan. This series is of small extent.
