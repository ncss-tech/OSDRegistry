SHARPRIDGE SERIES

The Sharpridge series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium weathered from tuff on mountain footslopes and backslopes. Slope gradients are 5 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and mean annual temperature about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy over clayey, amorphic over smectitic, frigid Alfic Vitrixerands 

TYPICAL PEDON: Sharpridge ashy silt loam - woodland, on a 26 percent north-facing slope at an elevation of 4,280 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)
