STAKE SERIES



The Stake series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable

soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  They are on low stream terraces

and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual

temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation

is about 10 inches.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haploxerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Stake silty clay loam--cropland.  On a less than 1

percent, smooth slope.  (When described the profile was moist

throughout.  Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.  This

profile was described June 15, 1978.)



    Ap--0 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, very

dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure;

hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common medium, fine and very fine

roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent (5 percent

calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth

boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)



    2A2b--9 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark

gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate coarse and medium platy structure;

roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent (1 percent

calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt discontinuous

boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky

structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots;

many very fine, common medium and fine tubular pores; slightly

effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH

8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)



    4A4b--19 to 30 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay, black (10YR

2/1) moist; strong medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard,

friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many medium and

very fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy

boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)



    5A5b--30 to 40 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular

blocky structure; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; common very

fine roots; common medium and fine and many very fine tubular pores;

mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)



    5Bk1--40 to 50 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; common medium prominent dark yellowish

brown (10YR 4/6) mottles moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard,

friable, sticky and very plastic; few medium and fine roots; many very

fine tubular pores; common fine irregular lime seams, slightly

effervescent (3 percent calcium carbonate); 4 percent pebbles; mildly

alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)



    5Bk2--50 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR

5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and

slightly plastic; common medium and fine roots; common medium and fine

and many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (13 percent

calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy

boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)



    6Ck--60 to 65 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, dark

grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few

very fine roots; common coarse irregular and many fine tubular pores;

strongly effervescent (15 percent calcium carbonate); moderately

alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series listed in the same family.

Similar soils are the Caldwell, Keigley, and Snow series.  These soils

have a fine-silty control section.  Caldwell and Snow soils are

noncalcareous throughout.  Keigley soils have 15 to 30 percent calcium

carbonate throughout the profile.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stake soils are on nearly level low stream

terraces and flood plains.  Elevations range from 4200 to 4900 feet.

They formed in mixed alluvium.  The climate is cold and moist in the

winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation

ranges from 8 to 12 inches including 1 to 2 feet of snow.  Average

annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free

period is 100 to 135 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Freedom, Genola and

Idahome(T) series.  All of these soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Genola

and Freedom soils have a fine-silty control section.  Freedom and

Idahome soils have calcic horizons.  Idahome soils have a coarse-silty

control section.  Genola soils are on flood plains and stream terraces

adjacent to Stake soils.  Freedom soils are on stream terraces above

Genola and Stake soils.  Idahome Soils are on fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow runoff; slow

permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all is used for irrigated crops.  The

principal crops are alfalfa and small grains.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho.  These soils are

inextensive.
