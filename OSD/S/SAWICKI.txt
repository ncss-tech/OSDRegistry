SAWICKI SERIES 

The Sawicki series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from hard fine grained igneous rock, gneiss, schist and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, escarpments, hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

USE AND VEGETATION: Sawicki soils are primarily used for rangeland, wildlife habitat and watershed.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Rocky Mountain juniper, big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, western yarrow, lupine, and arrowleaf baslomroot.  Areas with a forest canopy have an overstory of Douglas-fir and limber pine or ponderosa pine and an understory of rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Rocky Mountain juniper and big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sawicki soils are of moderate extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43A, 43B, 44A, 44B and 46.
