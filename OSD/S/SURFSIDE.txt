COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Nearby soils within the same subgroup include the Zummo series.
Zummo soils: are in the fine family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Clayey alluvium 
Landscape: Coastal Plains
Landform: Flood plains
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 812 to 1194 millimeters (32 to 47 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 21 to 22 degrees C (70 to 72 degrees F) 
Frost-free period: 330 to 365 days
Elevation: 0 to 3 meters (10 feet) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Galveston, Ijam, Mustang, Pledger, Tracosa, Velasco, and Veston series.
Galveston and Mustang soils: are sandy throughout and occur on dunes on barrier islands.
Ijam soils: are on anthropogenic dredge spoil deposits.
Pledger soils: are slightly higher on nearby landscapes, have better drainage and contain slickensides
Tracosa soils: do not have a thick dark soil surface horizon and have daily tidal influence
Velasco soils: are on flood plains and are calcareous throughout.
Veston soils: do not have a thick dark soil surface horizon, are on barrier island flats, and have coarser textures throughout.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Office

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brazoria County, Texas, 1978

REMARKS: Surfside soils were formerly considered a saline phase of the Pledger series. Classification changed from Vertic Haplaquolls to Vertic Endoaquolls on 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description. These soils do not have slickensides or wedge-shaped peds, so do not classify as Vertisols.

Typical pedon taxonomic features:
Aquic conditions: 0 to 200 centimeters
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 36 centimeters
Redox concentrations: 0 to 81 centimeters
Redox depletions: 36 to 200 centimeters
Reduced matrix: 0 to 200 centimeters
Secondary carbonates: 81 to 200 centimeters
Vertic features: 1 centimeter cracks extend to 51 centimeters and COLE > 0.9
Taxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th edition (2022)
