SLAUGHTERVILLE SERIES

The Slaughterville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy and sandy alluvial and eolian sediments, of Pleistocene age. These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on treads and risers of stream terraces, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature air is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 840 mm (33 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Udic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Slaughterville fine sandy loam, on a 3 percent convex slope, in improved bermudagrass pasture, at an elevation of 363 m (1190 ft).  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine and few medium roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Ap horizon is 18 to 28 cm [7 to 11 in])

  A--23 to 46 cm (9 to 18 in); brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 25 cm [3 to 10 in])

  Bw--46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine roots; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 25 to 142 cm [10 to 56 in])

  C1--76 to 147 cm (30 to 58 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common very fine roots; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

  C2--147 to 193 cm (58 to 76 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable; few very fine roots; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Canadian series in the same family. 
Canadian soils: have yellower hues

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in material weathered from loamy and sandy alluvial and eolian sediments of Pleistocene Age
Landscape: alluvial plain remnants 
Landform: treads and risers of stream terraces 
Slope: 1 to 45 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 660 to 1020 mm (26 to 40 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 18 degrees C (58 to 64 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 200 to 230 days
Elevation: 244 to 366 m (800 to 1200 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Canadian series, and the Derby, Dougherty, Konawa, Norge, Teller, and Vanoss soils.
Canadian soils: occur on nearly level to very gently sloping flood plains that are subject to rare flooding
Derby soils: have a sandy control section and occur on dunes
Dougherty and Konawa soils: have a fine-loamy control section and occur on higher landforms that are farther from the stream 
Norge, Teller, and Vanoss soils: have argillic horizons and occur on similar landforms that are farther from the stream

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well drained
Permeability: moderately rapid
Runoff: very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, low on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and medium on slopes greater than 20 percent

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for grazing livestock. Some areas are cultivated to wheat, cotton, grain sorghum, or peanuts. Tame pastures are mostly improved bermudagrass and weeping lovegrass. Native vegetation is mid and tall grasses with a few post oak trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Oklahoma; LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). The series is of small extent.
