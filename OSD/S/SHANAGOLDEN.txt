SHANAGOLDEN SERIES

The Shanagolden series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep to a densic contact. These soils formed in loamy alluvium and in loamy till underlain by dense mostly sandy lodgement till on drumlins. Permeability is moderate in the loamy alluvium, moderate to moderately slow in the loamy till and slow in the dense sandy till. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Alfic Oxyaquic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Shanagolden fine sandy loam, on a convex, southwest-facing, 16 percent slope, in a hardwood forest, at an elevation of about 1,550 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

TYPE LOCATION: Ashland County, Wisconsin; about 3 miles south and 8 miles west of Glidden; 500 feet south and 1,200 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 33, T. 43 N., R. 3 W.; USGS Clam Lake NE, Wis. topographic quadrangle; lat. 46 degrees 10 minutes 8 seconds N. and long. 90 degrees 45 minutes 12 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the dense sandy or loamy till ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Content of clay averages from 3 to 7 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of sand coarser than very fine averages 35 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy alluvium, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy till, and 5 to 35 percent in the sandy till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy alluvium and 5 to 25 percent in the loamy till and from 5 to 30 percent in the sandy till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 7 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the loamy alluvium and loamy till and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations are below the spodic horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.

Shanagolden soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the loamy alluvium and degree to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singularly or in combination.  The E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value, dry of 7 or more. The B part of the E/B or B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons has colors similar to the E described above.  The Bt part has colors similar to those of the 2Bt horizon described below.  Texture for the 2E/B or 2B/E is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.80 gm/cc in the glossic horizon. The B/E or 2B/E horizon does not have the clay increase to meet the requirements for an argillic horizon.

2Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4
Chroma: 3 or 4

3BCd and 3Cd horizons:

Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: predominantly loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand, but some pedons have sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam textures
Clay content--2 to 7 percent
Moist bulk density--1.85 to 2.00 gm/cc

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Butternut, Newood, and Nonesuch series.  Butternut soils have a mantle with more than 50 percent silt.  Newood soils have dense sandy loam till at depths of 40 to 60 inches that averages more than 7 percent clay. Nonesuch soils have a lithic contact at depths of 30 to 50 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy alluvium and in loamy till and underlain by dense mostly sandy lodgement till
Landform: drumlins
Slope: 2 to 30 percent
Elevation: 1100 to 1650 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches
Frost-free period: 90 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Butternut, Cable, Peeksville, and Torch soils. The somewhat poorly drained Peeksville soils and the very poorly drained Cable soils form a hydrosequence with the Shanagolden soils. The somewhat poorly drained Torch soils and the moderately well drained Butternut soils are on similar landscapes, but have a silty mantle. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from low to high. Permeability is moderate in the loamy alluvium, moderate or moderately slow in the loamy till, and slow in the dense till. Shanagolden soils have a seasonal perched water table at a depth of 2 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly in woodland. Common trees are red maple, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, paper birch, and northern red oak with eastern hop hornbeam, bigtooth aspen, white ash and yellow birch as associates in most stands. Some areas are cleared and used for pastureland or cropland. Corn, small grains, and hay are the common crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Wisconsin; LRR K and MLRA 90A. The soil is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Price County, Wisconsin, 2005. Source of the name is a township in southern Ashland County.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle-size control section: 10 to 40 inches. 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 4 inches (A); 
Spodic horizon: 4 to 14 inches (Bhs, Bs);
Glossic horizon: 14 to 25 inches (B/E);
Argillic horizon: 25 to 33 inches (2Bt);
Densic contact: 33 inches (2Cd); 
Lithologic discontinuity: at the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon at 25 inches and at the upper boundary of the 3BCd horizon at 33 inches;
Aquic features: Redoximorphic iron accumulations from 25 to 58 inches. 

The B/E horizon does not have the necessary clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.  The 2Bt is considered argillic because of the lithologic discontinuity.

These soils may be in the early stages of fragipan development.  A decision was made to recognize these dense layers (2BCd and 2Cd) as densic material at this time.
