SUNRIVER SERIES

The Sunriver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on pumice mantled stream terraces.  They formed in reworked ash deposits over older alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, glassy over mixed, superactive Aquic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sunriver ashy sandy loam - woodland, on a level stream terrace at 4200 feet elevation.  (When described (9/10/87), the soil was moist throughout.  The colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed litter of lodgepole pine needles and twigs.

    A--2 to 7 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) ashy sandy loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and common medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 70 percent pumice (0.5 to 2.0 millimeters); neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    AC--7 to 22 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) ashy loamy coarse sand, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 70 percent pumice (0.5 to 2.0 millimeters); neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    C1--22 to 26 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) ashy coarse sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; few fine faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) redox features; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine interstitial pores; 80 percent pumice (0.5 to 2.0 millimeters); few krotovinas (10 centimeters diameter); neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C2--26 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) ashy coarse sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; common medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6), and dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) redox features; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine interstitial pores; 80 percent pumice (0.5 to 2.0 millimeters); few krotovinas (10 centimeters diameter); alternating bands of dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) stains throughout; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 9 to 18 inches)

    2Bwb--31 to 62 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; many medium distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) and dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Deschutes County, Oregon; 1500 feet west and 1500 feet north of the southeast corner of section 1, T.21 S, R.10 E (Latitude 43 degrees, 46 minutes, 51 seconds N, Longitude 121 degrees, 28 minutes, 19 seconds W)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a loamy buried soil is 25 to 35 inches and the depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to oxidation-reduction mottles is 20 to 30 inches.  The soil moisture control section is usually moist, but it is dry in all parts for 30 to 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The upper ash mantle of the soil contains 70 to 90 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention is 25 to 50 percent, 15-bar water content on both dry and undried samples is 2 to 6 percent, and acid oxalate aluminum plus one half the acid oxalate iron is 0.40 to 0.80 percent.

The Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.

The AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5,6, or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is coarse sand or loamy coarse sand.  It contains 50 to 80 percent pumice (0.5 to 2.0 millimeters).

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It contains 50 to 80 percent pumice (0.5 to 2.0 millimeters).

The 2B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sunriver soils are on pumice mantled stream terraces.  These soils formed in reworked ash deposits over older alluvium.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Elevations range from 4000 to 4300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Shanahan and Steiger soils.  Shanahan and Steiger soils are on pumice plains and are somewhat excessively drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately rapid permeability.  These soils have a water table between 24 and 48 inches from April to June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential native vegetation is lodgepole pine, blueberry, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lapine Basin of central Oregon, MLRA 6.  The series is not extensive.

andic soil properties - from 2 to 31 inches, data based on the associated Steiger Series (S87OR-035-001).  The glass and glass-coated aggregate content in the very fine sand fraction is 73 to 95 percent.  Phosphate retention is 25 to 46 percent.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one half the acid oxalate iron is 0.5 to 0.9 percent.  The 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 4 to 7 percent.

Aquic subgroup - two percent or more redox segregations at 26 plus inches.
