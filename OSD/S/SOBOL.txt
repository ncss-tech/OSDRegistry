SOBOL SERIES

The Sobol series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These very gently sloping to strongly sloping upland soils are on side slopes and ridge crests in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains (MLRA 119).  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 1220 mm (48 inches), and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sobol loam--in native range.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

A--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; moderate medium and fine granular structure; friable; many roots of all sizes; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [8 to 28 centimeters (3 to 11 inches) thick]

BA--18 to 36 cm (7 to 14 inches); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam; moderate medium granular structure; firm; many roots of all sizes; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) thick] 

Bt1--36 to 64 cm (14 to 25 inches); coarsely mottled red (2.5YR 4/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and gray (10YR 5/1) clay; moderate fine and medium blocky structure; very firm; common fine roots; few fine fragments of shale; clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. [10 to 36 centimeters (4 to 14 inches) thick]

Bt2--64 to 76 cm (25 to 30 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) clay; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; weak medium blocky structure; very firm; few fine roots; about 5 percent by volume of shale fragments less than 76 mm in diameter; patchy clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline; abrupt irregular boundary. [0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) thick] 

Cr--76 to 89 cm (30 to 35 inches); gray shale, tilted 20 degrees from horizontal.
