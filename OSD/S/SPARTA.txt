SPARTA SERIES

The Sparta series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy outwash that has been reworked by wind. These soils are on nearly level to very steep treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys, outwash terraces, outwash plains, and dune fields.  Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Entic Hapludolls

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Monroe County, Wisconsin, 1923.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 203 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 centimeters (Ap and AB horizons);
udic moisture regime.

New series are needed for the moderately well drained, bedrock substratum, loamy substratum, and silty clay loam substratum phases.  

Type Location was visited on April 9, 2002 to verify and add lamellae in the lower part of the profile.
