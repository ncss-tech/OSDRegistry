SUEKER SERIES

The Sueker series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and meander scrolls. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Oxyaquic Xerofluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Sueker sandy clay loam, in pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

       A--0 to 11 cm; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) sandy clay loam, dark gray (5YR 4/1) moist; weak very fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine and common medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 cm thick)                                                

       C1--11 to 58 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

       C2--58 to 86 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; 2 percent fine prominent irregular dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) masses of oxidized iron in matrix; massive; hard, very firm; very sticky, very plastic; few fine interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 35 cm thick)                                  

       C3--86 to 105 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; 4 percent fine prominent irregular dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) masses of oxidized iron in matrix; massive; slightly hard, friable; moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)                                                                 

       C4--105 to 150 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) silty clay, gray (7.5YR 5/1) moist; 3 percent manganese masses and 10 percent fine prominent irregular dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) masses of oxidized iron in matrix; massive; very hard, very firm; very sticky, very plastic; few fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Lincoln County, Wyoming, 2017. The series name is derived from a local landmark.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Redoximorphic features -- from 58 to 150 cm (C2, C3, C4 horizons)
Particle-size control section -- from 25 to 100 cm (part of C1, C2, part of C3 horizons).

Sueker soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime and oxyaquic moisture subclass.
