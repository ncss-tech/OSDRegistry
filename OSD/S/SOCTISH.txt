SOCTISH SERIES

The Soctish series consists of very deep, well drained soils on floodplains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slope ranges from 2 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1524 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, nonacid, thermic Typic Xerofluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Soctish silt loam - under a stand of annual and perennial grasses. When described on June 5, 2002, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A1--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and medium tubular, and many very fine interstitial pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.

	A2--10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 10 to 35 centimeters)

	C1--30 to 60 centimeters (12 to 24 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.

	C2--60 to 90 centimeters (24 to 35 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3), moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.(Combined thickness of upper C horizons is 50 to 100 centimeters)

	C3--90 to 120 centimeters (35 to 47 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.

	C4--120 to 165 centimeters (47 to 65 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) very fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine through coarse roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0). (Combined thickness of lower C horizons is 70 to 100 centimeters)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st. This soil has a xeric moisture regime.

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 15 to 20 degrees C (59 to 68 degrees F). The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature is 6 degrees C or greater. This soil has a thermic soil temperature regime.

Soil reaction: moderately or slightly acid throughout the soil profile.

Organic carbon irregularly decreases with depth from 25 to 125 centimeters.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Soctish soils are on nearly level to gently sloping floodplain steps with slopes of 2 to 9 percent at elevations of 74 to 149 meters (243 to 489 feet).  They formed in recent alluvium derived from mixed sources.  The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 15 to 20 degrees C (59 to 68 degrees F).  The frost free period is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Tonnor series. Tonnor soils have a cambic horizon and are on higher level stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydrologic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing, orchards and urban development.  Vegetation on uncultivated areas is bristly dogtail, soft brome, blue wildrye and orchardgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. These soils are of small extent.
