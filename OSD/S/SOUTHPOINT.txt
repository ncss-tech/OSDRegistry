COMPETING SERIES: 
Herring Creek--occur in estuarine tidal creeks and have wood fragments in the solum and substratum

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Estuaries
Landform: Deep mainland coves and large basins
Parent Material: Silty terrestrial tidal marsh sediments overlying paleo-terrestrial organic deposits
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Bathymetry: 1.5 to 9.5 feet (0.5 to 3 meters) below MSL
Water Regime: Tidal, 1.0 to 2.0 feet (0.3 to 1 meter) tidal range

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Demas soils--do not have a buried histic epipedon within 40 inches of the surface; at shallower water depths
Mispillion soils--are not permanently submerged; have surface organic layers 16 to 51 inches thick; on adjacent tidal marshes
Transquaking soils--are not permanently submerged, have organic surface layers more than 51 inches thick; on adjacent tidal marshes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Agricultural Drainage Class: Very poorly drained (permanently submersed)
Permeability: Moderately slow or slow

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Most areas are unvegetated and function as estuarine benthic wildlife habitat is limited.  Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish are rare.
Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima).  Vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 5 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Maryland and Delaware and possibly Virginia.  This series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 2017.

REMARKS: Southpoint soils were formerly included with areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support limited submersed aquatic vegetation.  These soils would classify in the proposed Thapto-histic subgroup.  The original proposed series name was spelled South Point.  Refer to Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland; G.P. Demas, J.H. Brown, and M.C. Rabenhorst; July 1998.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon (oxidized)--the zone from 0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 centimeters) (Ag horizon)
Peraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 60 inches (0 to 150 centimeters) is permanently saturated
Sulfidic feature--The zone from 4 to 36 inches (10 to 91 centimeters) contains sulfidic materials (verified by moist incubation)
Thapto-histic feature--the zone from 36 to 60 inches (91 to 152 centimeters) (3Oeb and 3Oab horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
This pedon was sampled as S97MD047-001 and later entered into NASIS as 1997MD047111.  Radiocarbon analysis of a wood sample from the buried organic layer at a depth of 36 inches yielded a date of 1400 years B.P.
