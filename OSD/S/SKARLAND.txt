TYPICAL PEDON: Skarland stratified sand to silt - on a slope of 12 percent under feltleaf willow-mixed shrub/herbaceous scrub. (All colors are for moist soil)

        Oi--0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 cm); dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine roots, common medium and coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

        A/Oe--2 to 5 inches (5 to 13 cm); 75 percent dark brown (10YR 3/3) stratified sand to silt and 25 percent very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moderately decomposed plant material; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots, few medium and few roots; 2 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary.

        2CA--5 to 22 inches (13 to 56 cm); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) very gravelly loamy sand; single grain; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: There are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: flood plains on alluvial fans
Parent material: loamy alluvium over sandy and gravelly alluvium
Elevation: 2,779 to 3,507 feet (847 to 1,069 m)
Slope: 8 to 20 percent
Annual precipitation: 25 to 28 inches (623 to 715 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Nizina and Schleyer soils. Nizina soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, and occur on floodplains and alluvial fans. Schleyer soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, and occur on hills, mountains, outwash plains, and terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loamy alluvium and high to very high in the sandy and gravelly alluvium.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is feltleaf willow-mixed shrub/herbaceous scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
