SUMINE SERIES

The Sumine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Sumine soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sumine very cobbly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very thin platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 3 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (7 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--15 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt2--25 to 61 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 38 cm thick)

    Bt3--61 to 71 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 40 percent gravel and 18 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    R--71 cm; fractured quartzite; many distinct clay films on rock fragments and lining cracks in the bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Humboldt County, Nevada; about 6 miles southeast of Winnemuccca in Thomas Canyon of the Sonoma Range; approximately 2,400 feet west and 800 feet north of the southeast corner of section 14, T. 35 N., R. 38 E.; USGS Winnemucca East 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 54 minutes 11 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 40 minutes 11 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.9030556 latitude, -117.6697222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in the winter and spring, dry from early July through mid-October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 20 to 43 cm, includes the Bt1 horizon.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: averages 25 to 35 percent. 
Rock fragments: averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel or cobbles.  Lithology of fragments is mixed.

A horizons
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 2 to 5 percent.

Bt horizons
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, or very gravelly loam; some pedons have gravelly clay loam in thin Bt1 horizons.
Consistence:  Soft to hard dry, very friable to firm moist, moderately sticky or very sticky and moderately plastic or very plastic wet.
Structure:  Weak or moderate, very fine to medium angular or subangular blocky.  In some pedons the lower subhorizons may be massive.
Organic matter content: 1 to 3 percent in the Bt1 horizon, 0.5 to 3 percent in the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belate, Burnborough, Closkey, Devils, Gowjai, Granipeak, Jivas, Millan, and Torro series.

Belate, Burnborough, Millan, and Torro soils are very deep. Closkey, and Devils soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Granipeak soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Gowjai and Jivas soils are deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sumine soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golsum and Pernty soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sumine soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, low rabbitbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.  Some areas are invaded by stands of Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and eastern Nevada, eastern California, and western Utah.  These soils are extensive with about 327,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  The series concept occurs in MLRA 24, while the main acreage is in MLRA 25.  Other acres of this series are mapped in MLRAs 21, 23, 26, and 28B in Nevada and California and MLRAs 28A and 47 in Utah.
