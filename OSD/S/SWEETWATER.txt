SWEETWATER SERIES

The Sweetwater series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable over very rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium over sandy alluvium of Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping floodplains and sloughs.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sweetwater silty clay loam - on a 1 percent linear slope, in rangeland at an elevation of 755 m (2477 ft).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)
