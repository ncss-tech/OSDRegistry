SAWBUCK SERIES

The Sawbuck series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous, argillite, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, escarpments and sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sawbuck loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lewis & Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis & Clark County Area, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0427, MT8148.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 15 inches (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 9 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons); a particle size control section from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1 and part of Bt2 horizons).  Sawbuck soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
