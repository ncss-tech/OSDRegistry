SAWBUCK SERIES

The Sawbuck series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous, argillite, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, escarpments and sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sawbuck loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).
