SMOKEHOUSE SERIES

The Smokehouse series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 2540 millimeters (100 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Smokehouse very gravelly loam under a stand of white fir, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and snowberry.  When described on September 15, 2004, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Inpendence soil series.  Inpendence soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains slopes, and have slopes of 30 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1090 to 1486 meters (3576 to 4875 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2032 to 2794 millimeters (80 to 110 inches). Mean January temperature is about 3 degrees C (37 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F); and the mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F). The frost free period is about 75 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boardcamp and Triboard soils. The Boardcamp soils are fine-loamy with less than 35 percent rock fragment in the particle size control section and are found in areas of sandstone and mudstone. Triboard soils are fine with greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and are found in areas of metasedimentary lithology.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is white fir, grand fir, incense cedar and Douglas-fir with an understory of snowberry, whitethorn ceanothus and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. These soils are of small extent.

ADDITIONAL DATA: 

NSSL pedon number:  05N0640

Soil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The classification was changed in 2008 from Typic Palexerults to Humic Dystroxerepts after completion and review of the laboratory data, and again in 2012 to Pachic Humixerepts to reflect changes in the Keys to Taxonomy.
