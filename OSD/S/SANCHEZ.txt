SANCHEZ SERIES

The Sanchez series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Sanchez soils are on ridges, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Sanchez gravelly sandy loam in forest.   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    0i--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed needles and twigs; neutral (pH 6.8).

    E--2 to 4 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, friable; many clean sand grains; many fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel and flat rock fragments; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick)

    EB--4 to 9 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak thick or very thick platy structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; few fine pores; some clean sand grains; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--9 to 13 inches; pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) very channery clay loam, reddish gray (5YR 5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; faint continuous clay films on faces of peds; many fine discontinuous tubular pores; 35 to 50 percent rock fragments; moderately acid (pH 5.9); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    BC--13 to 19 inches; pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) very channery sandy clay loam, reddish gray (5YR 5/2) moist; few medium yellowish red mottles; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; many fine discontinuous tubular pores; 40 percent rock fragments; moderately acid (pH 5.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    R--19 inches; pinkish gray very fine grained, hard sandstone; brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist.

TYPE LOCATION: McKinley County, New Mexico; the northeast 1/4 of the northeast 1/4 of sec. 26, T. 14 N., R. 16 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Typically the soil moisture control section is moist in all parts from January to May and intermittently moist in some part from June to December. May and June are the driest months. Typic ustic moisture regime. 

Particle-size control section: 20 to 35 percent clay

Depth to lithic contact: 11 to 20 inches to hard sandstone

Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 10 to 16 inches

E horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 6 or 7 (5 or 6 moist)
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam
Rock fragments: 35 to 55 percent gravel and flat rocks
Reaction: neutral to moderately acid

Bt horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 (4 to 6 moist)
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam
Rock fragments: 35 to 55 percent gravel, channers, and flags 
Reaction: neutral to moderately acid 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackleaf (MT), Brickner (MT), Jagon (UT), Tolex (MT) and Wetmore (CO) series.  Blackleaf and Jagon soils have Bk horizons. Blackleaf, Brickner and Tolex soils are in MLRA 43B, most of the precipitation received is in the form of snow and they are moist in May and June.  Tolex soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Wetmore soils have granite bedrock and an argillic horizon with lamellae.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Parent material: residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone

Landform: ridges, hills and mountains

Slopes: 10 to 65 percent

Elevation: 6,500 to 8,500 feet

Mean annual temperature: 40 to 47 degrees F

Mean annual precipitation: 18 to 25 inches

Frost-free period: 80 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dye, Hogg, Kiln, McVickers, Osoridge, Palomino, Soldier, and Thurloni soils.  Dye soils have mesic temperature.  Kiln, Palomino, and Thurloni soils have mollic epipedons.  Hogg, McVickers, Osoridge, and Soldier soils are deeper than 20 inches.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, medium to very high runoff, moderate or moderately slow permeability 

USE AND VEGETATION: Lumber production, grazing, and recreation.  Ponderosa pine, pinyon pine, juniper, shrubs, and grasses are the principal plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: High mountains and high elevation plateaus of New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 39 & LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.
