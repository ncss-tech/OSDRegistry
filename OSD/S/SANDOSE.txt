SANDOSE SERIES 

The Sandose series consists of very deep to loam, well drained soils formed in eolian sand deposited over loamy sediments on uplands and stream terraces in the Nebraska Sand Hills (MLRA 65). These soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 11 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters (20 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C (49 degrees F) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls
 
TYPICAL PEDON: Sandose loamy fine sand, on a northeast facing slightly convex slope of 3 percent in a pasture. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described the soil was moist to 32 inches (81 centimeters), and dry below 32 inches (81 centimeters). 

  A1--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine and very fine roots throughout; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. 

  A2--18 to 41 centimeters (7 to 16 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine and very fine roots throughout; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) thick) 

  Bw1--41 to 76 centimeters (16 to 30 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common fine and very fine roots throughout; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (23 to 58 centimeters (9 to 23 inches) thick) 

  2Bw2--76 to 104 centimeters (30 to 41 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm; common fine and very fine roots throughout; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. 

  2Bw3--104 to 122 centimeters (41 to 48 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm; common fine and very fine roots throughout; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the 2Bw horizons is 33 to 71 centimeters (13 to 36 inches) thick)

  2BC--122 to 142 centimeters (48 to 56 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; few very fine roots throughout; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) thick)

  2C--142 to 203 centimeters (56 to 80 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; few very fine roots throughout; strong effervescence, moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anselmo, Doger, Duda, Dunday, Hennings, Ipage, Simeon, Tassel, and Valentine soils. 
Anselmo, Duda and Tassel soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Anselmo soils are coarse-loamy. 
Duda soils are moderately deep to sandstone.
Tassel soils are shallow to sandstone. 
Doger and Dunday soils are in similar positions and are sandy throughout.
Hennings soils are on similar landscape positions and have a fine-loamy control section. 
Ipage soils are lower on the landscape, do not have mollic epipedons, and are sandy throughout. 
Simeon soils are on similar landscape positions and breaks, are sandy throughout and contain more than 35 percent medium and coarse sand in the C horizon.
Valentine soils do not have mollic epipedons, are sandy throughout and are on hummocks and dunes.
 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: very low to medium
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in native grasses used for rangeland.
The remaining areas are used as cropland and most of the cropland is irrigated.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Primarily north-central Nebraska. The series is of moderate extent.
