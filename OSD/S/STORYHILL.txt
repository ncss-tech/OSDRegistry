STORYHILL SERIES

The Storyhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium.  These soils are on relict stream terraces and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Storyhill cobbly loam, in rangeland (colors 
are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 10 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) cobbly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium granular; soft, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots, common fine and medium roots, few coarse roots; 10 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt1--10 to 21 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common very fine and fine roots, few medium roots; 20 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--21 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common very fine and few fine roots; 25 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 12 to 32 inches).

    Bk--32 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; few very fine and fine roots; 30 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles; common fine threads of lime, common lime coatings on coarse fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Storyhill soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation may include subalpine needlegrasses, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain brome, sedges, lupine, sticky geranium, sagebrush, common snowberry and rose as well as other grasses, forbs and woody shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Storyhill soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records: MT1452, MT1603. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 10 to 32 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a calcic horizon from 32 to 60 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 30 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).  Storyhill soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
