SHIBAH SERIES

The Shibah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium over limestone gravel alluvium.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the underlying material.  These soils are on fans, terraces, sideslopes, and ridges of dissected terraces and fans on slopes ranging from 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Shibah loam, in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described the soil was dry throughout.)

A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots throughout; common very fine low continuity tubular pores; 19.0 percent clay; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches)

Bw--4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; common very fine low continuity tubular pores; 19.0 percent clay; 20 percent limestone-sandstone gravel and 5 percent limestone-sandstone cobbles; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches)

Bk--8 to 13 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very cobbly loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 19.0 percent clay; common irregular fine masses of lime; few carbonate coats on rock fragments; common fine irregular masses of lime pedogenic throughout; violently effervescent throughout (HCL, 1 normal); 20 percent limestone-sandstone gravel and 20 percent limestone-sandstone cobbles;  moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches)

BCk--13 to 18 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very cobbly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 18.0 percent clay; few carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent throughout (HCL, 1 normal); 30 percent limestone-sandstone cobbles and 20 percent limestone-sandstone gravel; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches)

C--18 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very cobbly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 18.0 percent clay; few carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent throughout (HCL, 1 normal); 30 percent limestone-sandstone cobbles and 20 percent limestone-sandstone gravel; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:

There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Elevation - 2,500 to 3,000 feet.

Slope - 3 to 50 percent.

Parent material - alluvium.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; hot dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 13 to 16 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boxwell, Bulltop, Cabbart, Fleak, Kremlin, Lonna, Maltese, Scairt and Tanna soils.  Boxwell soils are on side slopes of uplands.  They have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bulltop soils are intermixed with the Shibah soils.  They have a cambic horizon.  Cabbart and Fleak soils are on knobs and ridges.  They have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Kremlin and Lonna soils are intermixed.  They have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size-control-section.  Maltese and Scairt soils are on flats.  They have a natric horizon.  Tanna soils are on toe slopes and flats.  They have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Shibah soils are used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly blue grama and needleandthread.
