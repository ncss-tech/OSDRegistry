STONEBURG SERIES

The Stoneburg series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in materials
weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on gently sloping
uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Udic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stoneburg fine sandy loam--native range.
                (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark
brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard,
friable; many fine roots; common wormcasts; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

     B1t--11 to 16 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, dark
reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky
structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; common very fine pores; common wormcasts; few thin clay films; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

     B21t--16 to 26 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine roots; common thin clay films;
few fine Fe-Mn concretions; few quartz pebbles; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

     B22t--26 to 35 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; common fine distinct mottles of red and reddish yellow; moderate fine subangular blocky structure;
hard, firm; common fine roots; common very fine pores; common thin clay films; few fine Fe-Mn concretions; about 15 percent by volume
of partially rounded sandstone fragments mostly less than 3 inches across the long axis; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6
to 14 inches thick)

     Cr--35 to 40 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) strongly cemented sandstone; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Montague County, Texas; 5.7 miles north on U. S.  Highway 81 from intersection of Farm Road 1806 and U. S. Highway
81 at Stoneburg; 650 feet northeast of highway in rangeland
pasture.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to contact
with strongly cemented to indurated sandstone is 20 to 40 inches.

The A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown
(10YR 5/2), or brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2).  It is fine sandy loam or loam and medium acid through neutral.

The B1t horizon, where present, is brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4), or
reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4).  It is loam or light sandy clay loam and is slightly acid or neutral.  The B2t horizons are
clay loam or sandy clay loam with clay contents of 25 to 35
percent.

The B21t horizon is reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 5/4) or yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6).  It is medium acid through neutral.

The B22t horizon is yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8),
reddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8; 7.5YR 6/6, 6/8), or reddish brown
(5YR 4/4, 5/4), with few to common mottles of red, reddish yellow, strong brown, or yellowish brown.  Rock fragments in the B22t
horizon larger than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 10
percent by volume; rock fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 2 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction is medium acid through mildly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anocon, Chickasha, Cobb, Farnum, Grant, Kingfisher, Naron, Teller, Vanoss, and Zaneis series.
Anocon, Chickasha, Farnum, Naron, Teller, and Zaneis soils lack a contact with sandstone within a depth of 40 inches.  Cobb soils
lack mollic epipedons.  Grant, Kingfisher, and Vanoss soils have
less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand in the control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stoneburg soils are on uplands, mainly convex ridgetops.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent but are dominatly 1
to 5 percent. The soil formed in residuum from hard sandstone,
mainly of Permian Age.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Average
annual temperature near the type location is 64.7 degrees F.  The annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and the Thornthwaite P-E index is 49.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Anocon, Chickasha, and Zaneis series and the Lucien, Renfrow, and Vernon series.  Lucien soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and lack argillic horizons.  Renfrow and Vernon soils have clayey control sections and Vernon soils lack mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff;
moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for range but some areas are cultivated to small grain and sorghums.  Native vegetation is tall and midgrasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral Texas mainly in the Central Rolling Red Prairies and possible in Oklahoma.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Stoneburg soils formerly were included in the Chickasha series and classified in the Reddish Prairie great soil group.
