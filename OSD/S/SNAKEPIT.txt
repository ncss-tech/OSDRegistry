SNAKEPIT SERIES

The Snakepit series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands and alluvium derived from basalt and welded tuff. Snakepit soils are on depressions of plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Snakepit soils are on depressions of plateaus. These soils formed in eolian sands and alluvium derived from basalt and welded tuff. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 1,440 to 1,590 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brace, Spiderhole, and Wiskan soils. Brace soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to thin duripans over lithic contacts, and have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons. Spiderhole soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to indurated duripans, have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent slopes. Wiskan soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent hills and escarpments. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; negligible surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Snakepit soils are used for livestock grazing. The vegetation is mainly basin big sagebrush, needleandthread, Thurber's needlegrass, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 2,600 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
