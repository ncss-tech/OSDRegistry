SHOMUSHON SERIES

The Shomushon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in recent volcanic ash and cinder deposits.  The Shomushon soils are on lava plains, hills and lower mountainsides in remnant calderas of stratovolcanic islands that have been smoothed by recent volcanic fallout of ash and cinders.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 2032 millimeters (80 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy-skeletal, mixed, nonacid, isohyperthermic Vitrandic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Shomushon gravelly loamy fine sand, on a east facing, 1 percent slope in an ironwood forest at an elevation of 12 meters (40 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on June 5, 1999 the soil was slightly moist throughout.

    A--0 to 5 cm (0 to 2 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) , ashy loamy fine sand, lithochromic light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) , dry; weak fine platy parts to weak fine granular structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots and many very fine roots; 10 percent angular cinder gravel; neutral, pH 6.6 by 1:1 H2O; roots are concentrated at the horizon boundary; abrupt smooth boundary. 0 to 15 centimeters thick (0 to 6 inches)

    2C1--5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches); lithochromic dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) , ashy loamy fine sand, lithochromic gray (2.5Y 6/1) , dry; weak fine subangular blocky parts to weak fine granular structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots and many very fine roots; trace of cinder gravel; slightly acid, pH 6.2 by 1:1 H2O; roots are concentrated at the horizon boundary; abrupt smooth boundary. 13 to 25 centimeters thick (5 to 10 inches)

    3C2--10 to 13 cm (4 to 5 inches); lithochromic dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) , ashy very fine sand, lithochromic light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) , dry; weak medium platy structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; 5 percent angular cinder fragments; very strongly acid, pH 5.0 by 1:1 H2O; abrupt smooth boundary. 5 to 20 centimeters thick (2 to 8 inches)

    4C3--13 to 46 cm (5 to 18 inches); lithochromic very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) , ashy sand, lithochromic dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) , dry; weak single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common medium roots; 10 percent  angular cinder fragments; strongly acid, pH 5.3 by 1:1 H2O; roots are concentrated at horizon boundary; abrupt wavy boundary; 5 to 84 centimeters thick (2 to 33 inches).

    5C4--46 to 153 cm (18 to 60 inches); lithochromic very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) very gravelly ashy fine sand, lithochromic dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) , dry; weak single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; 45 percent angular cinder fragments; slightly acid, pH 6.4 by 1:1 H2O. 13 to 106 centimeters thick (5 to 42 inches).
