SPROULISH SERIES

The Sproulish series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rocks. Sproulish soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2160 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alambique (CA) and Nye (T) series. Alambique soils have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters. Nye soils have consolidated alluvium between 100 and 150 centimeters.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sproulish soils are on linear to concave or slightly convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 185 to 730 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimetary rocks. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canoecreek (CA), Gibsoncreek (CA), and Redwohly (CA) soils. Canoecreek soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and occur on linear to convex or slightly concave positions. Gibsoncreek soils have between 18 and 24 percent clay in the particle size control section and occur on linear to convex positions. Redwohly soils have bedrock with cracks spaced closer than 10 centimeters apart between 50 and 100 centimeters and are found on strongly convex positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high or very high runoff; moderately high to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes Douglas-fir, tanoak, and Pacific madrone, and evergreen huckleberry. When present, coast redwood is less than 50 percent

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is moderately extensive.
