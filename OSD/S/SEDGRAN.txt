SEDGRAN SERIES

The Sedgran series consists of shallow or very shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and granite.  Sedgran soils are on mountain slopes of 10 to 55 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sedgran extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand--wildlife habitat.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium granular structure; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; 20 percent cobbles and 45 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 8 inches thick)

    C--4 to 13 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) and brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 5 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    R--13 inches; granite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sandoval County, New Mexico.  Approximately 3.25 miles east of Interstate Highway 25 and 0.1 mile north of the Sandoval-Bernalillo County line on the Sandia Pueblo Indian Reservation; 1,300 feet east and 450 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 34 T.  12 N., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some parts of the soil moisture control section November through March and July through September.  The soil is driest May through June.

Soil temperature:  51 to 55 degrees F.

Soil depth:  6 to 20 inches to granite

Reaction:  neutral to slightly alkaline

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist

Rock fragments:  10 to 20 percent cobbles, 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent stones

C horizon 
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  4 through 6
Texture:  loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or coarse sand
Rock fragments:  5 to 15 percent cobbles, 35 to 50 percent gravel or channers and 0 to 10 percent stones.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sedgran soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 55 percent.  Elevations are 5,800 to 8,000 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium derived from granite and sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Millett and Tesajo soils.  Both Millett and Tesajo are on terraces and are deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; medium runoff; rapidly permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sedgran soils are used for wildlife habitat and recreation.  The present vegetation is little bluestem, New Mexico feathergrass, sideoats grama, and juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central New Mexico.  The series is of small extent.
