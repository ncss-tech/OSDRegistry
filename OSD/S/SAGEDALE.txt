SAGEDALE SERIES

The Sagedale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or in alluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, sedimentary plains, drainageways, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sagedale silty clay loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0682.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed) (A, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 11 inches (Bw horizon); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a horizon of gypsum accumulation (Bky horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2, Bky, and part of BC horizons).  Sagedale soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
