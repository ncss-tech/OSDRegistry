SATATTON SERIES

The Satatton series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in sandy eolian and storm washover sediments of Holocene age. These nearly level soils are on wind-tidal flats on the bay or lagoon side of barrier islands. These soils are subject to frequent flooding by wind tides and tropical storms. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Siliceous, hyperthermic Sodic Psammaquents

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: An aquic soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is 31 to 91 cm (12 to 36 in) from the soil surface. Although rainfall amounts are that of an ustic moisture regime, these soils remain saturated throughout in most years due to location on the landscape. The top of a permanent water table is at a depth of 31 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in) throughout the year in normal years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 23 to 24 degrees C (74 to 76 degrees F)
Depth to endosaturation: 31 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

Baffin soils: are Sodic Hydraquents and are on a lower landform under seawater.
Daggerhill and Greenhill soils: are Ustic Quartzipsamments and are on foredunes and back-island dune fields.
Madre soils: are not frequently flooded and on barrier flats.
Malaquite soils: are Typic Halaquepts and on barrier flats.
Mustang soils: are Typic Psammaquents and are on barrier flats.
Padre and Panam soils: are Aquic Quartzipsamments and are on low dunes or mounds on barrier flats.
Tatton soils: are very poorly drained and on slightly lower landforms
Twinpalms soils: are Aquic Ustorthents and are on spoil pile islands.
Yarborough soils: are Typic Halaquepts and are on spoil pile islands. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class:  Poorly drained
Permeability:  rapid above the high water table, but the overall permeability class is very slow 
Runoff: high on flats and negligible in depressions due to the depressional feature of the wind-tidal flats.
Flooding: frequent for brief periods with salt water, which occur during times of high wind that pushes water onto the wind-tidal flats, storm surges, and heavy rains associated with tropical storms
A permanent water table fluctuates from 30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in) below the soil surface. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: primarily as wildlife habitat and for recreation. These soils are essentially barren of vegetation but have a thin benthic, blue-green algal mat consisting of Cyanobacteria. Halophytic vegetation consisting of saltwort and glasswort occur for short periods after inundation. The surface salinity rises as the surface dries, and eventually becomes toxic to the plants.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Willacy County, TX, 1980. 

REMARKS: The series type location was moved from Willacy County to Kenedy County during the Soil Survey of Kenedy County because of easier access, local laboratory data, and more centralized series concept. The classification was changed from Typic Salorthids to Typic Aquisalids in 1995 based on application of the 6th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The classification was changed in December 2004 from Typic Aquisalids to Sodic Psammaquents based on application of the 9th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy and field investigations during the mapping of Padre Island National Seashore.
