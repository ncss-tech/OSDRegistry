SPRINGHOLLOW SERIES

The Springhollow series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. They are on dissected plateaus, ridge tops and hillsides.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Haplic Haploxerollic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Springhollow gravelly silt loam in fallow; on a 4 percent north-facing slope at 6,730 feet.  When described on September 6, 1989, the soil was dry throughout.  (Color is for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent (15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 12 inches thick)

    Ap2--3 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk1--11 to 19 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate thick and very thick platy structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk2--19 to 29 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bkq--29 to 36 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam (texture of less than 2mm material between plates), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong thick platy structure that is weakly cemented; extremely hard, extremely firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent (50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bkqm--36 inches; lime-silica indurated duripan.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Springhollow soils are on dissected plateaus on low hills, ridges and sideslopes.  They are generally on smooth to slightly convex slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 7,500 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium with some silty alluvium from loess.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches, the average annual air temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F and the frost free season is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arbone, Niter, Thatcher and Vicking soils.  All of these series lack duripans and they are very deep.  Arbone soils are in slightly concave areas around and interspersed with Springhollow soils.  Niter soils are on smooth to concave slopes on ridge sideslopes and hillslopes.  Thatcher and Vicking soils are on nearly level undulating areas to moderately steep hillslopes, generally lower on the landscape than Springhollow soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Springhollow soils are used for nonirrigated cropland and rangeland.  Typical crops consist of small grains.  The potential natural vegetation is mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  This series is not extensive. MLRA 13 and 43B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008. The name is taken from a nearby spring.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 11 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 11 to 36 inches (Bk1, Bk2 and Bkq horizons)

Duripan - the limiting layer at 36 inches (Bkqm horizon)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 36 inches  (part of the Ap2, the Bk1, the Bk2 and the Bkq horizons)

Carbonatic mineralogy - the particle-size control section averages 42 percent calcium carbonate equivalent
