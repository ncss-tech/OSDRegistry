SETTLEMEYER SERIES

The Settlemeyer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks.  The Settlemeyer soils are on flood plains and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

(13 to 50 cm thick)

    2C2--104 to 152 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, many fine, medium and coarse distinct dark brown (10YR 3/3) iron redox concentrations, olive gray (5Y 5/2) dry; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Nevada; approximately 700 feet south of Genoa Lane on the F. Settlemeyer Ranch; about 1,000 feet west and 1,100 feet south of the apparent northeast corner of section 14, T. 13 N., R. 19 E.; USGS Minder 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 59 minutes 41 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 48 minutes 39 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9947222 latitude, -119.810833 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Dry in mid summer and early fall, moist in late fall through early summer.  Apparent seasonal water table is between 30 to 90 cm in winter and spring.  Drained phases are recognized.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 30 to 60 cm.
Reaction:  Neutral through very strongly alkaline.  The higher reactions are only in sodium affected pedons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 25 to 35 percent.
Sand and gravel:  15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser particles.

A and AC horizons
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 3.
Effervescence:  Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent in the upper part of the A horizon, but is not effervescent in all parts between 25 to 50 cm.
Other features:  Some pedons have up to 15 cm of 0 horizon of primarily undecomposed base of plants and stems.

C horizons
Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 3.
Structure:  Weak, medium and fine angular blocky or it is massive.
Texture:  Very stratified clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.
Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard dry, friable to firm moist, nonsticky to sticky and nonplastic to plastic wet.
Redox features:  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features of reddish, greenish, or yellowish hues with chromas of 1 through 4, or the matrix has base colors indicative or gleying.
Other features:  Some pedons have few small 0.5 to 1.5 cm carbonate concretions.

2C horizons
Effervescent:  Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ambraw, Gansner, Ozamis, Toppenish and Sloan series.  

Ambraw, Gansner, Ozamis and Sloan soils are noncalcareous in all parts of the A horizons. Toppenish soils have unconformable very gravelly materials within the particle-size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Settlemeyer soils are on flood plains and inset fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks including granitic and basic igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,375 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Heidtman, Job, Voltaire and Yobe soils.  Heidtman soils are never saturated above a depth of 50 cm.  Job soils do not have mollic epipedons and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Voltaire soils are in a calcareous family.  Yobe soils do not have mollic epipedons and have fine-silty particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; very slow or slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils are subject to overflow. Some areas have altered drainage due to stream channel entrenchment.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Meadow hay, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creeping wildrye, basin wildrye, and sedges.  Saltgrass and alkali sacaton dominate in salt and sodium affected areas. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R026XY030NV, Loamy Bottom 8-12 PZ.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central and western Nevada.  These soils are inextensive. MLRA 26, 27, 29, 21, 28B.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 56 cm (A1, A2 and AC horizons).
Endosaturation - The zone from 56 to 152 cm (The C, 2C1 and 2C2 horizons).
