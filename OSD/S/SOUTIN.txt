SOUTIN SERIES

The Soutin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Soutin soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Deseret series.  Deseret soils are saturated with water for 90 or more days within a depth of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Soutin soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks such as shale, sandstone, and conglomerate.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 5,700 to 5,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.   The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ashdown and GraffPoint soils.  Ashdown soils are fine-loamy.  GraffPoint soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soutin soils are used for rangeland and urban development.  Important plants are Wyoming big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 360 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (Ay1 and Ay2 horizons).

Gypsic horizon - The zone from 27 to 60 inches (By3, By4, and BCy horizons).
