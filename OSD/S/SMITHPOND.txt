SMITHPOND SERIES

The Smithpond series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from interbedded calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Smithpond soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, structural benches and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery Area, Utah, 2011, Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand and Sevier Counties soil survey area.  Named for nearby Smith Pond. Prior to 2010 Smithpond soils were included in the Milok series.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  (parts of Bw, Bk1 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 53 cm.  (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 53 to 138 cm.  (Bk horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
