SEVY SERIES

The Sevy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Sevy soils are on fan terraces, relict lake terraces, stream terraces, strath terraces and alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sevy sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; the immediate surface to about 1/2 inch, has weak thin platy structure; the remainder of the horizon has moderate to strong very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; very fine vesicular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

     Bt--4 to 13 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; faint nearly continuous clay films; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (9 to 20 inches thick)

     Btk--13 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak and moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few faint clay films; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

     Bk--16 to 34 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, discontinuous weak cementation, sticky, plastic; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 inches thick)

     C--34 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Iron County, Utah.  About 4.8 miles south of Beryl Junction, about 1,320 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 22, T. 36 S., R. 16 W. ; Beryl Junction USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 38 minutes 7 seconds N. and long. 113 degrees 38 minutes 32 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture: These soils are dry for 50 to 65 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  The moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.  
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 52 degrees F.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 6 to 21 inches.

Particle-size control section:
  Clay content: 20 to 35 percent. 
  Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent. 

A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 4.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist. 
Chroma: 4 or 5.  
Texture: Clay loam or sandy clay loam, and less commonly, loam.  
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel.  
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Btk horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR. 
Value: 4 to 6 dry and 5 moist. 
Chroma: 4 or 5.  
Texture: Clay loam or sandy clay loam, and less commonly, loam.  
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Bk horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR. 
Value: 5 to 8 dry and 4 to 7 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 4.  
Texture: Clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. 
Other features: Thin weak carbonate-cemented layers occur discontinuously in the Bk horizon, but the material is friable and porous throughout most of the mass.

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 6 or 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist.  
Chroma: 3 or 4.  
Texture: Loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam.  
Rock fragments: 0 to 20 percent gravel.  
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ackelton (ID), Dixie (UT), Paulville (ID), Stiles (CA), and Woozle (ID) series.  Ackelton soils have duripans below 40 inches. Dixie soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Paulville soils have lithological discontinuities below the argillic horizon and allow 10YR hues. Stiles soils have an average clay content of 30 to 35 percent in the control section. Woozle series have hues of 10YR in the argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sevy soils are on fan terraces, relict lake terraces, stream terraces, strath terraces and alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Elevations are 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The freeze free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Taylorsflat, Crestline and Clurde soils. All of these soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow to medium runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and Southern Utah. This series is of moderate extent. MLRA 28A.
