SWANSONLAKE SERIES

The Swansonlake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or slide deposits. These soils are in drainageways, flood plains, sags or sag ponds. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active Argic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Swansonlake loam in native rangeland at an elevation of 2,551 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oe--0 to 3 cm: mucky peat; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A--3 to 13 cm; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) dry; weak medium and coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots and common medium and coarse roots; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 40 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 34 cm; black (10YR 2/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and very fine roots and common medium and coarse roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; few fine and medium yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) oxidized iron concentrations; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--34 to 75 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine, and few medium roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; common fine, medium and coarse yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) oxidized iron concentrations and common fine, medium, and coarse yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) oxidized iron concentrations; many fine and medium gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt3--75 to 120 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine, and few medium roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; many medium and coarse yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) oxidized iron concentrations; many medium and coarse gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt2 and Bt3 horizons is 56 to 90 cm)

    Btg--120 to 154 cm; greenish gray (10Y 5/1) clay, greenish gray (10Y 5/1) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; very few fine roots; very few fine dendritic tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; common very fine yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) oxidized iron concentrations; many coarse and very coarse very dark greenish gray (5GY 3/1) iron depletions; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).
