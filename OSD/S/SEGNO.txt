Ecological sites assigned to phases and components of this series are listed below.  Current ecological site assignments are in Web Soil Survey.  Components of this series include the following ecological sites:  Loamy Upland

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Polk County, Texas; 1930.

REMARKS:  The series type location was moved during the update of MLRA 152B to better represent the series concept. The previous type location based on pedon S64TX-170-4 is located in an area close to the Willis Formation and Lissie Formation contact. The majority of the Segno soils are mapped over the Lissie Formation. The Lissie Formation areas typically have less than 5 percent plinthite. Some areas were correlated to the Otanya series in previous surveys. Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon:  0 to 42 cm (0 to 16.5 in) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon:  42 to 203 cm (31.9 to 80 in) (Bt/E, Bt, Btc horizons) 
Glossic horizon: 42 to 81 cm, (16.5 to 31.9 in)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Soil Survey Lab data available on pedon S12TX29111035. Data from 3 pedons in Montgomery County are published in SSIR-30 (S64TX-170-3 and S64TX-170-4) and pedon S78TX-339-001 in Characterization Data for Selected Texas Soils, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, January 1986.
