SCUDDER SERIES

The Scudder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, slide deposits derived from limestone and other calcareous sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on hills, mountain slopes, and debris avalanches.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Ustic Calcicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Scudder gravelly loam, in forestland on a 16 percent slope at an elevation of 2,300 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

  Oi--0 to 5 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter. (3 to 6 cm thick)

  A--5 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

  Bw--13 to 28 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

  Bk1--28 to 58 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 25 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; 25 percent fine, distinct, irregular, soft masses of calcium carbonate, and 80 percent medium, distinct, irregular calcium carbonate nodules on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick)

  Bk2--58 to 79 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very cobbly sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 25 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; 50 percent fine, distinct, irregular, soft masses of calcium carbonate, and 80 percent medium, distinct, irregular calcium carbonate nodules on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 75 cm thick) 

  BCk--79 to 152 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, and 80 percent medium, distinct, irregular calcium carbonate nodules on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
