SKYBERG SERIES

The Skyberg series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 25 to 75 centimeters of silty and loamy sediments and the underlying glacial till.  These soils are on linear and concave slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 785 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fillmore County, Minnesota, 1955

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 36 to 86 centimeters (Btg1, 2Btg2, and 2Btg3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, E, Btg1, 2Btg2, 2Btg3, 2BCg, and 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and E horizons); 
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 107 centimeters (Btg1, 2Btg2, and 2Btg3 horizons);
aquic suborder--2.5Y 4/2 color of matrix with redoximorphic concentrations in the zone from a depth of 36 to 117 centimeters (Btg1, 2Btg2, 2Btg3, and 2BCg horizons).

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

This is a benchmark soil on the Minnesota list of benchmark soils. 

Type location moved from Goodhue County Minnesota to Freeborn County, Minnesota to better represent the central concept of the series.

Historically there has been an overlap with this series and the Oran series.  Based on MLRA correlation, the drainage class of Skyberg series is changed to poorly drained and the drainage class of Oran series remains somewhat poorly drained.  Depending on landscape position, much of what was mapped Skyberg in the past may be correlated as Oran in the future.
