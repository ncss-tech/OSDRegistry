SUGLO SERIES

The Suglo series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium on terraces and fans.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Suglo loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 5 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent limestone and sandstone pebbles; slightly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

     A2--5 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 15 percent limestone and sandstone pebbles; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

     Bk1--11 to 16 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; very few thin clay films on vertical faces of some peds; 25 percent limestone and sandstone pebbles; strongly effervescent, lime as common small masses and as pendants on coarse fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

     Bk2--16 to 19 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent limestone and sandstone pebbles; strongly effervescent, soft powdery lime is disseminated and coarse fragments are coated with lime; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

     C2--19 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; 30 percent limestone and sandstone pebbles; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Crook County, Wyoming; 1,400 feet north and 220 feet west of cattle guard at the center of sec. 6, T. 51 N., R. 62 W.
2 - Suglo Series

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches.  Depth to continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate is 12 to 24 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is typically gravelly loam, Clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Limestone and sandstone gravel averages 15 to 35 percent in the control section, but some horizons may contain as much as 60 percent gravel.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.

The Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Carbonates range from 15 to 40 percent. It is moderately or strongly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Free carbonates are present but are less than the overlying horizon and decrease rapidly with depth.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aut, Dioxice, Escabosa, and Havenweep series.  The Aut and Escabosa soils have a lithic contact of 20 to 40 inches.  The Dioxice soils have slightly hard or hard consistence in the surface horizons and massive calcic horizons to 60 inches or more with fragments of strongly cemented or indurated caliche.  The Havenweep soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Suglo soils are on high bench terraces and pediments.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  They formed in alluvium of mixed origin.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches, most of which falls in the spring and early summer.  Elevation is 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nihill, Sugardee, Tilford, and Vale soils.  Nihill soils are loamy-skeletal and lack calcic horizons.  Sugardee and Vale soils have argillic horizons.  Tilford soils lack a calcic horizon and the coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread grass, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Wyoming.  The series is inextensive.
