SANCRANE SERIES  

The Sancrane series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in medium textured alluvium over flood deposited gravel.  Sancrane soils are on stream terraces and flood plains.  Permeability is moderate through the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous Typic Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sancrane silt loam--on a 2 percent slightly concave, northeast-facing slope at 6,290 feet elevation in improved pastureland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on June 20, 1985 the soil was dry to 8 inches and moist below this depth with ground water at 24 inches).

    Akg--0 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; common lime filaments in soil matrix; violently effervescent (35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)  

    Bkg1--2 to 8 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; common lime filaments in soil matrix; violently effervescent (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)  

    Bkg2--8 to 15 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular and interstitial pores; strongly effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)  

    Bkg3--15 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; common fine and medium distinct gray (N5/) depletions; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; strongly effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick) 

    2Cg1--24 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly loamy sand, olive (5Y 4/3) moist; single grain; loose; few fine roots; many medium and coarse interstitial pores; 45 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)  

    2Cg2--31 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; many medium and coarse interstitial pores; 65 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sancrane soils are on stream terraces and flood plains.  These soils formed in medium textured alluvium over flood deposited gravel.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,400 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and cool in summer.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches.  Average annual temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 20 to 55 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dickeypeak and Thosand (T) soils.  Dickeypeak soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces and have average summer soil temperatures greater than 43 degrees F. and fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Thosand soils are on stream terraces and have a fine-loamy, particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches to strongly contrasting textures.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Slow runoff; moderate permeability through the solum and very rapid in the substratum.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pastureland.  The vegetation is grasses and sedges.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
