SWISBOB SERIES

The Swisbob series consists of very deep, well drained soils on eroded fan remnants that formed in alluvium from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 380 mm; mean annual air temperature is 7 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; approximately at the south 1/4 corner of sec. 28, T. 5 N., R. 70 E.; USGS Miller Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 15 minutes 33 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 8 minutes 21.9 W; UTM zone 11, 750290e, 4238440n; NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring, dry in all parts at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice (July and August), but intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September; xeric soil moisture regime bordering aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon: 20 to 38 cm thick.
Depth to calcic horizon: 7 to 30 cm. 
Other features: Parent material contains a component of ashy material in the matrix.
Mineralogy: 5 to 24 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction and 0.05 to 0.09 percent AL plus 1/2Fe extracted by ammonium oxalate.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bess, Border, Cedarpoint, Chesnimnus, Fewkes, Justesen, Mccarey, Pegram, Pinehollow, Redpine, Vicking and Vickton series. 

Bess soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Border, Chesnimnus, Justesen, Pegram and Vickton soils are not intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms. Cedarpoint, Fewkes and Vicking soils have less than 5 to 24 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction. Mccarey, Pinehollow and Redpine soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swisbob soils are on eroded fan remnants at elevations of 1,900 to 2,100 meters. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from welded tuff over lacustrine deposits. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers but, occasionally moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days (July through August) due to summer convection storms. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., mean summer temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 450 mm, with most of it as snow.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Homestake and Satt series. Homestake soils have 35 to 40 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Satt soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazing and wildlife habitat. The principal vegetation is low sagebrush and antelope bitterbrush, with bluegrasses, Thurber's needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY125NV, Gravelly Clay Pan 14+ P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. Swisbob soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
