01/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note-Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Type location moved, and classification changed to isomesic Fulvudands based on an update project, and review of series distribution and extent. Further data collection is required to confirm soil temperature regime. The competing Arta soils should be included with future update work as their distribution and series concept overlap.

04/1994--Previously classified as medial, mesic, Andic Haplumbrepts. Classification change based on amendments to Soil Taxonomy establishing the Andisol soil order.
