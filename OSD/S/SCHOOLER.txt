SCHOOLER SERIES

The Schooler series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a duripan that formed in mixed alluvium. They are on basalt plateaus and mesas. Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Haplic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Schooler extremely stony silty clay loam - on a slope of 2 percent under rangeland vegetation at 5,400 feet elevation. When described on September 4, 1990, the soil profile was dry from 0 to 14 inches and slightly moist from 14 to 28 inches. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely stony silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; 10 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 25 percent stones, 1 percent boulders; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium platy structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones, 1 percent boulders; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt2--5 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly silty clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt3--14 to 22 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly silty clay, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, 5 percent boulders; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Btq--22 to 26 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; 1 to 5mm thick silica coats on undersides of rock fragments; neutral (pH 6.8); clear irregular boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bqm--26 to 28 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3), weakly cemented duripan, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure in the upper inch and massive below; very hard, very firm, brittle, nonsticky and nonplastic; upper part is weakly cemented by silica and the lower part is a laminar cap 1 to 5 mm thick on top of bedrock; rock fragments are coated with silica; 30 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones. (1 to 5 inches thick)

    2R--28 inches; basalt

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Blackleg series. The Blackleg soil lacks bedrock immediately below the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schooler soils are on basalt plateaus and mesas.  The slopes range from 2 to 6 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Elevations are 5,100 to 5,800 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches. The average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost free season is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHIC ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Duguesclin and Willho series. Duguesclin and Willho soils are on the same landscape as the Schooler soil. Duguesclin soil is very deep to bedrock and are found in concave positions. Willho soils are deep to bedrock, are found on mounds.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Schooler soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Schooler soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.
