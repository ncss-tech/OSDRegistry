SILTCLIFFE SERIES

The Siltcliffe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 
alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks. Siltcliffe soils are on alluvial flats and beach plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Avalon(CO), Kilroy(UT), Pariette(UT), and Redhouse(UT) series. 

The Avalon soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms. Kilroy soils have 15 to 35 percent sandstone or quartzite rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms. Pariette soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms. Redhouse soils have hues of 5YR or redder and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms redder and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section that have sandstone or shale lithology. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Siltcliffe soils are on alluvial flats and beach plains. These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 4,550 to 5,200 feet.
