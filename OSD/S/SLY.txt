SLY SERIES

The Sly series consists of very deep, well drained soils on dissected terraces and structural benches in canyons. They formed in loess deposits with minor amounts of volcanic ash overlying basalt. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 3 to 50 percent. The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 32 inches.

TYPICAL PEDON: Sly ashy silt loam, forest, on a 5 percent slope at 3,000 feet elevation. When described on April 14, 1983, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sly soils are on dissected terraces and structural benches in canyons. Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent. These soils formed in loess deposits overlying basalt at elevations of 1,100 to 3,400 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 40 inches. The frost free period is from 50 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Agatha, Bobbitt, Helmer, Hugus, Santa and Tigley soils. Agatha soils are on northeast and northwest-facing terrace escarpments and canyonsides and have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Bobbitt soils on south-facing canyon slopes are mesic and xeric. Helmer and Santa soils are on dissected terraces, have fragipans and are moderately well drained. Hugus soils are on north-facing toeslopes and dissected terraces and are loamy-skeletal. Tigley soils are on south-facing toeslopes and dissected terraces and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, hay and pasture, homesites, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, western white pine, and lodgepole pine with an understory of queencup beadlily, myrtle pachystima, bunchberry dogwood, goldthread, violet, common prince's pine, longtube twinflower, sedge, starry false-Solomon's seal, western rattlesnake plantain, American trailplant, and shinyleaf spirea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho. MLRA 43A. This soil is not extensive.
