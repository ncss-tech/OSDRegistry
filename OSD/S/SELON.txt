SELON SERIES

The Selon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits or alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Humic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Selon fine sandy loam, in woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A1--1 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--4 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 3 to 9 inches) 

    E--8 to 23 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores and common fine and medium tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick) 

    E/Bw--23 to 40 inches; E part (80 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; B part (20 percent) is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; as random small masses and discontinuous horizontal thin bands; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2). (12 to 35 inches thick) 

    C--40 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1972. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0039.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 1 to 8 inches (A1, A2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 11 to 41 inches (E, E/Bw, C horizons); a cambic horizon from 23 to 40 inches (E/Bw horizon).  Selon soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime. 

The 11/2010 revision reflects a reclassification from Typic Haploxerepts to Humic Haploxerepts subgroup based on revisions to the 11th Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy. No other changes were made during this revision.
