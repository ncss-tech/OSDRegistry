SPASPREY SERIES

The Spasprey series consists of moderately deep over strongly cemented duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fan piedmont remnants, alluvial fans and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Haploxeralfic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Spasprey sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(20 to 38 cm thick)

    Bqk--30 to 74 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine, fine, and medium tubular pores; 10 percent durinodes and a few silica-cemented lamella; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear irregular boundary.  (10 to 46 cm thick)

    Bqkm--74 to 117 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) strongly cemented duripan; massive; extremely hard, brittle; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear irregular boundary.  (13 to 50 cm thick)

    Cqk--117 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, nonplastic and nonsticky; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); continuous brittle matrix.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aquinas, Boulflat, Cherry Spring, Eastval, Yody, and Zaidy series.  

Aquinas soils have medium acid or slightly acid A and Bt horizons that are 76 to 100 cm thick over the duripan.  Boulflat soils have a duripan capping bedrock within a depth of 100 cm.  Cherry Spring soils have formed largely in loess with a component of ash; have 25 to 46 cm thick A horizons; and have a silt loam, loam or clay loam argillic horizon with less than 35 percent sand. Eastval soils have a subhorizon within the argillic horizon with more than 35 percent clay. Yody soils have moderately alkaline A and Bt horizons that are 36 to 60 cm thick over a calcic horizon and a duripan at a depth of 76 to 100 cm.  Zaidy soils have Btk horizons and have 10 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spasprey soils are on fan piedmont remnants, alluvial fans and lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Haybourne, Indian Creek, and Wedertz soils.  Haybourne soils lack argillic horizons and duripan.  Indian Creek soils have fine textured argillic horizon and have a duripan within a depth of 50 cm.  Wedertz soils have weak silica cementation but lack a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, with scattered areas of antelope bitterbrush and desert peach. This pedon is correlated to R026XY016NV, Loamy 8-10" PZ.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Valleys of western and central Nevada. These soils are of small extent.  MLRA 26, 28B.
