SPROLLOW SERIES

The Sprollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and alluvium of limestone with some loess influence.  They are on ridges, hillsides, and mountainsides.  Permeability is moderate.  Sprollow soils have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Typic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sprollow gravelly loam, rangeland; on a 43 percent west-facing slope at 6,640 feet elevation.  When described on November 2, 1984 the soil was moist throughout. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium and common coarse roots; many fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 2mm fraction); disseminated lime; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium and common coarse roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; strongly effervescent (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 2mm fraction); disseminated lime; 25 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk1--7 to 16 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine tubular and irregular pores; violently effervescent (42 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 20mm fraction); disseminated lime; 5 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk2--16 to 24 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (52 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 20mm fraction); disseminated lime; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk3--24 to 34 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (72 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 20mm fraction); disseminated lime; 65 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    R--34 inches; limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bakerpeak (T) and Preuss (T) series.  Bakerpeak soils are very deep.  The Preuss soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sprollow soils are on ridges, hillsides and mountainsides.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 5,100 to 7,300 feet.  The soil formed in residuum and alluvium from limestone with some loess influence.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches, average annual air temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F., and the frost free period is 65 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lonjon and Mumford soils.  Lonjon soils have mollic epipedons.  Mumford soils are shallow to bedrock.  Lonjon soils are generally on north-facing slopes and in concave areas.  Mumford soils are on similar positions as Sprollow, but are on slightly higher, convex slopes when associated with Sprollow soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sprollow soils are used for rangeland.  The native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent. MLRA 43B and 47.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Franklin County, Idaho, 1997. Proposed in Bear Lake County, Idaho, 1992.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 2 inches (the A horizon).

Calcic horizon - the zone from 7 to 34 inches (the Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons).

Lithic contact - The boundary at 34 inches to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 34 inches (part of the Bk1 horizon, the Bk2 and Bk3 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil samples will be collected for laboratory analysis for organic carbon to determine if this soil should have a mollic epipedon.
