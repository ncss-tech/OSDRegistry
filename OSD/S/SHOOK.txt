SHOOK SERIES

The Shook series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium from granite. These soils are on mountains. Slope is 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Shook coarse sandy loam, in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--O to 8 inches, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) coarse sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw1--8 to 16 inches, brown (10YR 4/3) coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw2--16 to 28 inches, brown (10YR 4/3) coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 17 inches thick)

    BC--28 to 36 inches, brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky; few fine and very fine roots; 50 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

    Cr--36 to 60 inches; decomposing granite bedrock (grus).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - mountains
Elevation - 5000 to 7000 feet
Slope - 4 to 60 percent
Parent material - residuum or colluvium from granite
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 25 inches
Mean annual temperature - 34 to 40 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for rangeland. The principal native vegetation is rough fescue, green needlegrass, indian ricegrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Montana. This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bitterroot Valley Area, Montana, 1952.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 28 inches (A and Bw horizons); a paralithic contact at 36 inches (Cr horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 36 inches (part of the Bw1, the Bw2, and the BC horizons). Shooksoils have an ustic moisture regime and a cryic temperature regime.
