SUPERVISOR SERIES

The Supervisor series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granite, gneiss sandstone, basalt and schist. Permeability is moderately rapid. These soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes ranging from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Supervisor stony loam - forest (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

       0i--0 to 2 inches; loose mat of fir and pine needles in various stages of decomposition. (1 to 4 inches thick)

       A1--2 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak and moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 20 percent stones; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

       A2--6 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stony loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 25 to 30 percent angular pebbles and stones; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

       AC--12 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many medium roots; 35 to 40 percent pebbles and stones; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

       C--18 to 24 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very stony sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, common medium roots; 45 to 55 percent gravel and stones; moderately acid; gradual boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

       R--24 inches; hard fractured granite with material similar to the C horizon in fractures.

TYPE LOCATION: Valencia County, New Mexico; SW 1/4 sec. 21, T. 11 N., R. 12 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Depth to bedrock:  20 to 40 inches

Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent with the larger percentage in the 12 inch zone above the bedrock.

Cobbles and stones: 10 to 35 percent

Reaction: moderately acid to neutral.

Soil temperature: 34 through 46 degrees F.

Soil moisture: Typic ustic moisture regime.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 through 3
Texture: loam or sandy loam.

AC and C horizons
Hue: 5YR through 10YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 through 5
Texture: dominantly sandy loam but loam is common
Clay content: about 7 to 18 percent
Silt: less than an estimated 50 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Antrobus (CO), Grafen (CO), Greyback (WY), Handran (CO), Maurice (MT), McCort (WY), Midelight (WY), Parachute (CO), Sebud (MT),  Surdal (MT), Teemat (WY), Thornburgh (CO), Tiban (MT), Tineman (WY) and Vanwirt (CO) series.  Antrobus, Greyback, Handran, Maurice, McCort, Midelight, Sebud, Teemat, Thornburgh, Tiban, Tineman and Vanwirt soils do not have bedrock within 40 inches. Parachute and Surdal soils have a cambic horizon and more than 18 percent clay. In addition, all these soils are in LRR-E and are moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Supervisor soils formed in residuum weathered from granite, sandstone, basalt, gneiss, and schist. They have slopes that range from 3 to 60 percent and their rock-controlled landscapes range in elevation from 8,500 to 10,500 feet. Annual temperature ranges from an estimated 34 to 46 degrees F., and annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 35 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chimayo, Cundiyo, Mirabal, Nambe, and Tampico soils. Chimayo soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock and have mesic temperature. Mirabal and Cundiyo soils lack a mollic epipedon and Cundiyo soils have an argillic horizon. Nambe soils lack a mollic epipedon. Tampico soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Recreation, wildlife, and some forest products.  White fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, Oregon grape, lupine, carex, and junegrass are the principal plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: High mountains of New Mexico. MLRA 39.The series is moderately extensive. Approximately 225 acres has also been mapped in Montana in MLRA 43B.
