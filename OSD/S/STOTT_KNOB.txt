MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina, 2003. 

REMARKS: The Stott Knob series is a mesic Piedmont counterpart of the Cowee series. Placement in the fine-loamy, parasesquic, mesic Typic Hapludult family is based on the similar placement of the Cowee series. 

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 19 inches (Bt horizon)
Paralithic contact--bedrock contact at a depth of 30 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 30 to 47 inches (Cr horizon) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Presence of hard bedrock--bedrock contact at 47 inches (R horizon)
Series control section--0 to 40 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: Parasesquic mineralogy class was determined by total iron oxide, by weight (DCB Fe multiplied by 1.43) plus percent, by weight, gibbsite of more than 10 in the fine-earth fraction.
