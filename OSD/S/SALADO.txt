SALADO SERIES

The Salado series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on fan piedmont. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.
