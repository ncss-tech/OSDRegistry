SPANG SERIES

The Spang series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from scorio.    These soils are on sedimentary plain, alluvial fans, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Spang sandy loam, mixed grassland and woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 6 inches)

    Bw1--6 to 17 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw2--17 to 38 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (16 to 24 inches thick)

    C--38 to 61 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES:

Busby (MT) - has horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation; does not have hue redder than 10YR throughout.

Toby (ND) - does not have hue redder than 10YR throughout. (Currently this soil is classified as a Borollic Camborthids.)

Twilight (SD) - has a paralithic contact of sandstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.


GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans; hills; sedimentary plains.

Elevations - 2,200 to 4,500 feet.

Slopes - 2 to 25 percent.

Parent material - alluvium or colluvium derived from scorio.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 16 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees.

Frost-free season - 100 to 135 days.


DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Spang soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, prairie sandreed, forbs, and shrubs.  Some areas have a low density overstory of ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Spang soils are of small extent in southeastern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rosebud County, Montana, 1985.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0169.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed) (A, Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 6 to 38 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2, C horizons).  Spang soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
