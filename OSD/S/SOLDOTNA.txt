TYPE LOCATION: Western Kenai Peninsula Area, Alaska SW 1/4, SE 1/4, section 35, T.7 N., R.12 W., Seward Meridian, Alaska.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum thickness: 10 to 20 inches
Loess mantle thickness: 15 to 30 inches over the gravelly substrata
Exchange complex in solum: dominated by amorphous material
Small pockets of ash: occur in the loess mantle in some pedons

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 2 to 4
Reaction class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

E horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

Bs horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4; chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

BC and C horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 1 to 6
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam modified by 0 to 30 percent gravel
Reaction class: moderately acid or slightly acid

2C horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 1 to 6
Texture: fine sand, sand, stratified sand to silt loam modified by 0 to 50 percent total coarse fragments; 35 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles
Reaction class: moderately acid or slightly acid

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chulitna, Kashwitna, Nancy, and Shoestring series in the same family, and the Homestead series.  Chulitna soils are bisequal and have loess mantles thicker than 30 inches.  Kashwitna and Nancy soils are bisequal and are extremely to strongly acid throughout the entire control section.  Shoestring soils contain coarse fragments of volcanic ash.  Homestead soils have loess mantles thinner than 10 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash-influenced loess over sandy and gravelly drift
Landform: outwash plains and moraines on till plains
Slopes: 0 to 45 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 17 to 22 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Kalifonsky, Kenai, Naptowne, and Salamatof soils. Kalifonsky soils are mottled, poorly developed soils in depressional areas. Kenai soils are on moraines and have firm substrata. Naptowne soils are also on moraines and have finer textured substrata. Salamatof soils are very poorly drained organic soils in muskegs.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loess mantle and high to very high in the loose substrata.

USE AND VEGETATION: The native vegetation is a forest of white spruce, paper birch, and quaking aspen. Where cleared, crops include grasses, potatoes, and other vegetables.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, Western Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
