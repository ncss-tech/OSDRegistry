SWEATLODGE SERIES

The Sweatlodge series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Sweatlodge soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sweatlodge coarse sandy loam, on a northeast aspect, convex, 7 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 5,760 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on June 26, 1995, the soil was dry throughout.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain, loose, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots and common medium roots; noneffervescent; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt--2 to 5 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots and common medium roots; many medium interstitial and tubular pores; few distinct discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk--5 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots and common medium roots; many very fine, fine and medium interstitial and tubular pores; few irregular masses of carbonates throughout; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 11 inches thick)

    Cr--11 to 60 inches; sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Fremont County, Wyoming; about 6 miles north of Ethete; about 1,600 feet west and 1,500 feet south of the northeast corner of section 32, T. 2 N., R. 1 E.; USGS Ethete, Wyoming topographic quadrangle; 43 degrees 6 minutes 28.5 seconds north latitude and 108 degrees 46 minutes 56.1 seconds west longitude, NAD 83.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Griffy soils are on similar landforms in concave positions; depth to bedrock is greater than 40 inches.
Saddle soils are on similar landforms and positions; depth to bedrock is between 20 and 40 inches.
Oceanet soils are on similar landforms and positions; they do not have an argillic horizon.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Fremont County, Wyoming (Wind River Basin Area), 2003.  The name is derived from the sweat lodges still used on the Wind River Indian Reservation located on the ridges adjacent to where this soil was described.
