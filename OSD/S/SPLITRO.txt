SPLITRO SERIES

The Splitro series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone. These soils are on mountain slopes, dipslopes and hillslopes. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 559 mm, and mean annual air temperature is 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Splitro sandy loam, on a west facing 7 percent slope in grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 20 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 35 cm thick)

    Bw--20 to 41 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel and 3 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    R--41 cm; hard quartzitic sandstone.

Tuggle (MT) - have a paralithic contact above the lithic contact; formed in granite
Udelope (NV) - have a xeric soil moisture regime 
Vorsid (CO) - do not have a cambic horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain slopes, dip slopes and hillslopes
Elevation - 1,981 to 3,048 meters
Slope - 0 to 60 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum
Mean annual precipitation - 457 to 635 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 1.7 to 4.4 C
Frost-free period - 40 to 75 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Passcreek and Sawcreek soils. Both of these soils are moderately deep and occur on lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as native pastureland or for recreational purposes. Native vegetation is green needlegrass, Idaho fescue, and yarrow. May have scattered ponderosa pine and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Splitro soils are of moderate extent in the Bighorn Mountain areas of Wyoming and Montana, and the western slope of Colorado. MLRA 43B, 46 and 48A.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lower Colorado Area, Colorado 1970.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon.
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 20 cm (A horizon)
Cambic horizon - from 20 to 41 cm (Bw horizon)
Lithic contact - at 41 cm (R horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 41 cm (part of the Bw horizon)

Note: These soils were originally classified as Lithic Cryoborolls with an MAP of 508 cm (20 inches). In 1994 an MAP range of 457 to 635 mm (18-25 inches) was added to the OSD. Currently (04/2018), Splitro soils are mapped along the Rocky Mountains from southern Montana to central Colorado and encompass what appear to be both udic and ustic soil moisture regimes, as well as, both cryic and frigid temperature regimes. An investigation to determine correct moisture and temperature regimes for the extent of these soils is warranted.
