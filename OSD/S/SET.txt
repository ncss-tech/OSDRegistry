SET SERIES

The Set series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in clayey and loamy residuum derived from claystone bedrock of Pennsylvanian age. These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on ridges and escarpments of hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, carbonatic, thermic Typic Calciustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Set clay, extremely stony, on a convex 20 percent slope, in rangeland.

Lewisville and Quanah soils: have less than 35 percent total clay in the particle-size control section. 
Nuvalde and Venus soils: have less than 40 percent carbonates in the particle-size control section. 
Bolar soils: are underlain by limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches. 
Nuff soils: have sola 20 to 40 inches thick over claystone and are wetter for longer periods during growing season. 
Somervell soils: contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landscape: Hills
Landform: footslopes and backslopes of ridges and escarpments on hills

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hensley, Leeray, Owens, Palopinto, Thurber, and Truce series. 
Hensley and Palopinto soils: occur on gently sloping limestone ridgetops. 
Leeray soils: have gilgai micro-relief and occur below on broad nearly level and gently sloping footslopes and toeslopes. 
Owens soils: have light colored surfaces, contain less calcium carbonate, and occupy positions similar to Set soils. 
Thurber soils: are below along broad, nearly level to gently sloping valleys. 
Truce soils: have light colored loamy surfaces and occur on lower footslopes positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Set soils are well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is high on 1 to 5 percent slopes and very high on slopes greater than 5 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland, but a few small gently sloping areas are cultivated to small grain or forage sorghum. Native grasses consist of sideoats grama, little bluestem, silver bluestem, buffalograss, and Texas needlegrass. Forbs include Maximilian sunflower, Engelmann-daisy, dalea species, and western ragweed. Sumac species, oak, elm, and whitebrush also occur. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central Texas; LRR H - Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region, MLRA 80B - Texas north-central prairies; The series is of moderate extent.
