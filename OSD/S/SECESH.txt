SECESH SERIES 

The Secesh series consists of very deep, well drained soils on floodplains, stream terraces, and footslopes. They formed in about 2 feet of loamy alluvium and the underlying cherty residuum or alluvium from limestone and sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, mesic Ultic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Secesh loam - on a slope of 3 percent in a meadow at an elevation of 800 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam; brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 5 percent chert gravel; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to l0 inches thick) 

   BE--8 to 11 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 5 percent chert gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick) 

   Btl--11 to 19 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; l0 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

   Bt2--19 to 27 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 10 to 25 inches) 

   2Bt3--27 to 39 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) very gravelly sandy clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 45 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

   2Bt4--39 to 51 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 75 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

   2Bt5--51 to 65 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam; common medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 65 percent chert gravel; very strongly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Oregon County, Missouri; about l0 miles southeast of Winona and about 400 feet east of Falling Springs Cemetary, l,450 feet east and 100 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 4, T. 25 N., R. 3 W; USGS Greer topographic quadrangle, latitude 36 degrees 52 minutes 15 seconds N. and longitude 91 degrees 17 minutes 35 seconds W., CONUS 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 21 to more than 80 inches. Chert gravel ranges from 0 to about l5 percent in the A and upper B horizons, l0 to 35 percent in the lower Bt horizons, l0 to 50 percent in the upper part of the 2Bt horizon, and l0 to 80 percent in the lower horizons. Chert cobbles are 0 to l0 percent above the 2Bt horizon, 0 to l5 percent in the upper 2Bt horizon, and 0 to 35 percent in the lower horizons. It is neutral to strongly acid in the A horizon and moderately to very strongly acid in the Bt and lower horizons. 

The A, Ap, and AB horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is loam, but ranges to fine sandy loam and silt loam. 

The BE, Bt, 2Bt, 3Bt, or 4Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. They are silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam, or their gravelly analogs in the Bt and the nongravelly to extremely gravelly or very cobbly analogues of silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay in the 2Bt. 

Some pedons have a 2C horizon with colors similar to the 2Bt horizon. It is gravelly to extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or loamy sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Botetourt and Ingledove series. These soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity with an increase in rock fragments. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Secesh soils are on nearly level to gently sloping floodplains, stream terraces, and footslopes. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. They formed in about 2 feet of loamy alluvium and the underlying cherty residuum or alluvium from limestone and sandstone. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 45 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Horsecreek and Midco soils.  Horsecreek soils are fine-silty and are on higher terrace elevations. Midco soils are loamy-skeletal and are on lower floodplain positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Runoff is negligible to low. Permeability is moderate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Most areas are subject to rare or occasional flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas large enough for extensive use are in pasture or hay crops. Some areas are forested. Native vegetation is a combination of grasses and hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ozark Highland region (MLRA 116A) of Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas. The series is of large extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Mark Twain National Forest Area, Missouri (parts of Carter, Oregon, Ripley, and Shannon Counties), l972. 

REMARKS:  Mineral counts are needed to determine if the mineralogy of this soil is mixed or siliceous. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  
ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Ap and BA horizons); 
argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 11 inches to 65 inches or more (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4 and 2Bt5 horizons).
