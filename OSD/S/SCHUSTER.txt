SCHUSTER SERIES

The Schuster series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite. These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Palecryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Schuster loam, rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 3 cm; leaves.

    A1--3 to 18 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    A2--18 to 48 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear irregular boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    E--48 to 76 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) dry, weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0) clear wavy boundary. (20 to 45 cm thick)

    Bt1--76 to 114 cm; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) gravelly clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt2--114 to 162 cm; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) very gravelly clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) dry, moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots, few thin clay films; 65 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

Nordic soils have the upper boundary of the Bt horizon at depths of 100 to 117 cm and have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. Norway Flat soils have gravelly sandy loam to gravelly sandy clay loam Bt horizons and have A/B horizons.
