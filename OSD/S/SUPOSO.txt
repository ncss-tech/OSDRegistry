SUPOSO SERIES

The Suposo series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on stream terraces, valley sides and valley floors and have slopes of 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Suposo clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--10 to 41 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and common medium roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (18 to 30 cm thick)

    Btk--41 to 79 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds; calcium carbonate segregated as thin filaments and threads; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (23 to 43 cm thick)

    BCk--79 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; calcium carbonate segregated as thin filaments and threads; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.
