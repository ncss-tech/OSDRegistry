SWYGERT SERIES

The Swygert series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils on ground moraines and end moraines that are moderately deep or deep to a densic contact with till. They formed in clayey till or in clayey lacustrine sediments and the underlying clayey till. A mantle of loess or silty material as much as 51 cm (20 inches) in thickness is on the surface of some pedons. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: Williamsport is the only series in this family. Williamsport has less clay in the subsoil. Soils in similar families are the Chenoa, Clarence, Denrock, Elliott, Frankfort, Rutland, and Shullsburg series. Chenoa, Elliott, and Rutland soils average less than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Clarence soils average more than 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Denrock soils contain hues redder than 10YR. Frankfort soils lack a mollic epipedon. Shullsburg soils contain a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Swygert soils are on convex slopes on relatively undissected parts of the till plain of Wisconsinan Age. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in calcareous clayey till or clayey lacustrine sediments and the underlying calcareous clayey till. A surface mantle of loess or silty material as much as 51 cm (20 inches) in thickness is on some pedons. The climate is mid-continental with hot summers and cold winters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 150 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 160 to 259 meters (525 to 850 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Frankfort and Rutland soils, and the Bryce, Chatsworth, Mokena, and Mona soils. The poorly drained Bryce soils are in a drainage sequence with Swygert soils. They are on low-lying, nearly level areas and lack an argillic horizon. The moderately well drained Chatsworth soils are on severely eroded parts of the landform both above and below Swygert soils. They have thinner sola and lack an argillic horizon. Frankfort soils form a biosequence with Swygert soils. They formed in similar materials and are on nearby landforms. Mokena soils and the moderately well drained Mona soils are on higher positions on the landform and have part of their subsoils formed in loamy outwash and contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Rutland soils are on nearby landscapes where the loess or silty material is thicker. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. An intermittent perched high water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) below the surface at some time between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low (0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately low (less than 0.42 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderately slow and slow in the solum and very slow in the underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay are the principal crops. Native vegetation is prairie grass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Illinois and northwestern Indiana. Extent is large in MLRAs 108A, 110, 111C, and 111D.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Livingston County, Illinois, 1938. 

REMARKS: In soils such as this, with materials in the control section of mixed origin, clay mineralogy determinations are imprecise. Several indicators should be used. The X-ray diffraction patterns at NSSL indicate a smectitic placement. However, that method should be compared to weighted CEC/clay and LE/clay ratios that are outside the limits commonly set for the smectitic mineralogy class. The relative proportion of clay minerals is a function of the kind and amount of mixing of materials over the till. In all pedons the mineralogy of the till is illitic. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon horizon 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 inches) (Ap, A, and Bt1 horizons); argillic horizon 30 to 130 cm (12 to 51 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon is S1977IL075005 (NSSL Lab Pedon Number 40A2786, Field Label Nos. 77P 1071 - 77P 1078) from a characterization study of soils formed in fine-textured materials in northeastern Illinois.
