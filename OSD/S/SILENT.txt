SILENT SERIES

The Silent series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from limestone dolomite, quartzite, shale, sandstone, welded tuff and a small component of volcanic glass. The Silent soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Argidurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Silent gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 15 percent gravel. 

 A--0 to 10 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak thin and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine and few medium vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick) 

 Bt--10 to 20 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick) 

 Btk1--20 to 30 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common fine and medium distinct very pale brown (10YR 8/2) secondary calcium carbonate masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick) 

 Btk2--30 to 43 cm; mottled white (10YR 8/1) and light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films lining pores; few weakly cemented lenses of secondary calcium carbonate; 15 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 30 cm thick) 

 Bqkm--43 cm; white (10YR 8/1) indurated duripan, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; very rigid; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; approximately 1,500 feet north and 1,420 feet east of the southwest corner of section 31, T. 3 S., R. 56 E., Mount Diablo base line and meridian. USGS Tempiute Mountain North 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 38 minutes 21 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 43 minutes 43 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.6391667 latitude, -115.7286111 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, but are moist in winter and early spring and intermittently for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms during the period July through October; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C. 
Depth to duripan: 26 to 50 cm. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline. 
Carbonates: Calcareous throughout. 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent in the material less than 2 mm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 25 to 35 percent. 
Rock fragments: Average 5 to 35 percent. 

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist. 
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist. 

Bt horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR. 
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist. 
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist. 
Texture: Clay loam or sandy clay loam having less than 35 percent clay content. 
Structure: Weak fine or medium prismatic or weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky. 
Consistence: Very friable or friable, slightly sticky or moderately sticky. 

Btk horizons
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR. 
Value: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist. 
Chroma: 1 through 6, dry or moist. 
Texture: Clay loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam. 
Structure: Subangular blocky or massive. 
Consistence: Very friable or friable, slightly sticky or moderately sticky, slightly plastic or moderately plastic. 
Other features: Contains considerable amounts of segregated secondary calcium carbonate and can be weakly cemented in spots. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cleaver, Corder, Laped, Shoofly, Spanel, and Tumtum series. 

Cleaver, Spanel and Tumtum soils are noncalcareous in some part of the argillic horizon. Corder and Laped soils are moderately deep over bedrock. Shoofly soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Silent soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, quartzite, shale, sandstone,welded tuff and a small component of volcanic glass. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,490 to 1,830 meters. The climate is cool semiarid. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 130 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aysees, Bluewing, Cliffdown, Sierocliff, and Sundown soils. Aysees, Bluewing and Sundown soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and calcic horizons. Cliffdown and Sierocliff soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation consists mainly of galleta, bud sagebrush, shadscale, and winterfat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Nevada and possibly in adjacent areas. The soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 29.
