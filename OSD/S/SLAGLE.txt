MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Prince George County, Virginia, 1980.

REMARKS: These soils have been included with the Goldsboro and Wrightsboro series in previous mapping.  The October 2011 update restricts the Slagle series to MLRA 133A.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 9 to 55 inches (Bt horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and masses within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size, chemical, and mineralogy data for the typical pedon are available from VPI soil survey laboratory. Pedon number S73VA41-54(1-6). Data Map Unit ID (type location):
