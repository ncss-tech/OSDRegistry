SIXMILE SERIES

The Sixmile series consists of moderately deep to shale, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale.  Sixmile soils are on hills and ridges.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sixmile clay loam - grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 4 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/2) clay loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

     BCk1--4 to 20 inches; gray (5YR 6/1) clay loam, dark gray (5YR 4/1) moist; massive; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few calcium carbonate concretions occurring discontinuously and erratically throughout the horizon; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

     BCk2--20 to 30 inches; reddish gray (10R 5/1) clay loam, dark reddish gray (10R 4/1) moist; massive; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few calcium carbonate concretions occurring discontinuously and erratically; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 27 inches thick)

     Cr--30 inches; reddish gray (10R 5/1) calcareous Morrison shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Boulder County, Colorado; approximately 650 feet west and 1,000 feet north of the SE corner of sec. 8, T.3N., R.70W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by peak periods of precipitation during the months of April through June.  The soil is driest December through February.  Ustic soil moisture regime bordering on Aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 58 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature:  59 to 79 degrees F.
Depth to the paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to shale
Depth to cambic horizon:  3 to 6 inches

Particle-size control section:  18 to 35 percent clay; 20 to 55 percent silt, an 20 to 50 percent sand with 15 to 35 percent being fine or coarser sand; rock fragments range 0 to 15 percent

A horizon:
Hue:  10R through 5YR
Value:  4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma:  1 through 4 dry or moist  (When the value is as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist the horizon is too thin or contains too little organic matter to be a mollic epipedon.)
Reaction:  slightly to strongly alkaline

BCk horizon:
Hue:  10R through 5YR

Texture:  loam or clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 10 percent
Reaction:  moderately to strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Kachina, McRae, Teromote, and Ziggy series.

Kachina, McRae, Teromote, Ziggy:  do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within 60 inches of the surface
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale of the Morrison formation
Landform:  hills and ridges
Slopes:  10 to 50 percent
Elevation:  5,800 to 6,600 feet
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer
Mean annual temperature:  48 to 52 degrees F.
Mean summer temperature:  about 66 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  120 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Neville and Thedalund soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as native pastureland or irrigate cropland.  Principal native vegetation is blue grama, western wheatgrass, and cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central portions of Colorado adjacent to the front range.  LRR E, MLRA 49.  Series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Boulder Area, Colorado, 1971.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 30 inches.  (BCk1, BCk2)
Cambic horizon.  The zone from 4 to 30 inches. (BCk1, BCk2)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with shale at 30 inches (Cr)

Classification was changed from Ustic Torriorthents to Aridic Haplustepts 5/1999.  Horizonation, content, and competitors were also updated 5/1999.
