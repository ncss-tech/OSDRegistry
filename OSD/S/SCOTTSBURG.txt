SCOTTSBURG SERIES

The Scottsburg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess, loamy slope alluvium, and the underlying residuum from black shale. They are moderately deep to a layer with fragic soil properties. Scottsburg soils are on strath terraces within dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Berea, Hibler, Leipsic (T), Liverpool, and Morehead series. None of these soils have horizons with fragic soil properties within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scottsburg soils are on strath terraces within dissected till plains. They are on treads. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess, loamy slope alluvium, and the underlying residuum from black shale. The shale is from the New Albany Formation, Devonian System. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained Blocher, Deputy, and Jennings soils, the well drained Cincinnati and Trappist soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Whitcomb soils. Blocher and Deputy soils do not have a horizon with fragic soil properties in the series control section. Cincinnati and Jennings soils have a fragipan in the series control section. Blocher, Cincinnati, and Jennings soils are on higher lying back slopes and shoulders of till plains. Deputy soils are on similar landform positions as the Scottsburg soils. The moderately deep Trappist soils are on risers of strath terraces. Whitcomb soils are on treads of strath terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the horizon with fragic soil properties and low to moderately high in and below this horizon. Permeability is moderate above the horizon with fragic soil properties and slow or very slow in and below this horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are being used to grow cultivated crops, mainly corn and soybeans. A few areas are used for growing small grain, mainly wheat. A few areas are used hay or pasture, or are in woodland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 114A in southeastern Indiana. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scott County, Indiana, 1995.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: 20 to 135 cm (8 to 53 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Btx1, 2Btx2 horizons).
Redoximorphic features: 79 to 155 cm (31 to 61 inches).
Fragic soil properties: 79 to 135 cm (31 to 53 inches) (Btx1, Btx2 horizons).
Paralithic contact: at 155 cm (61 inches) (Cr horizon).
Lithic contact: at 170 cm (67 inches) (R horizon).

This series would classify as Fragic Oxyaquic Hapludults, but currently no such subgroup exists in the Hapludults great group. The semiactive CEC class is assigned to this series, but this soil borders on the semiactive and active groups.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for the typical pedon S87IN-143-001 at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.
