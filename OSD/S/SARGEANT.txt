SARGEANT SERIES

The Sargeant series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 30 to 66 centimeters (12 to 26 inches) of loess or loamy sediments and the underlying glacial till.  These soils are on interfluves and long side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters (about 31 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (about 48 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Mower County, Minnesota, 1949. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 48 to 99 centimeters (19 to 39 inches) (B/E, 2Bt1, and 2Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches) (Ap, E, E/B, B/E, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons). 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (0 to 13 inches) (Ap and E horizons); 
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 64 centimeters (13 to 25 inches) (E/B and B/E horizons)                                                                                                                        argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 191 centimeters (19 to 75 inches) (B/E, 2Bt1,2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime. 

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 30 centimeters (2 to 12 inches) wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area. 

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, ninth edition, 2003. 

The change to bulk density of 1.75 to 1.90 g/cc and low to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity was based on field and lab data and supported by the MLRA-104 steering committee.

The need for this in the western part of the MLRA-104 is questioned.  Further field investigations are needed to see if the series concept is valid in the eastern part of the MLRA in the future.   The glossic horizon is in question as to the extent in the MLRA.  If the glossic horizon is not typical, this series competes with the Oran series.  This series may become inactive in the future.
