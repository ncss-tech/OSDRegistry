STACKER SERIES

The Stacker series consists of moderately deep, well drained, soils that formed in loess over basalt. Stacker soils are on plateaus, hillslopes, footslopes, and benches. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Stacker silt loam- rangeland, on a 4 percent south-facing slope at an elevation of 1,275 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

 A1--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

 A2--6 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 12 to 20 inches)

 Bt--18 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common fine irregular and tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

 2R--28 inches; basalt bedrock

TYPE LOCATION: Klickitat County, Washington; 5 miles northeast of The Dalles, Oregon; about 1,375 feet south and 2,500 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 7, T.2N., R.14E. (Latitude 45 degrees, 40 minutes, 39 seconds N. and Longitude 121 degrees, 06 minutes, 06 seconds W.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Clay content in the particle-size control section averages from 20 to 30 percent and rock fragments from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout. The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.
The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry.
The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stacker soils are on plateaus, hillslopes, footslopes, and benches at elevations of 250 to 3,200 feet. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent. These soils formed in loess over basalt. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The average January temperature is 33 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 63 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fisherhill, Lickskillet and Walla Walla soils. Fisherhill soils are on side slopes and benches and are very deep. Lickskillet soils are on uplands, are shallow and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Walla Walla soils are on terraces and are coarse-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing, crop production, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, yarrow, and fiddleneck.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington. MLRA 8. The series is of moderate extent.
