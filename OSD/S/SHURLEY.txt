SHURLEY SERIES

The Shurley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from gneiss, schist, and granite rock.  These soils are on hills, mountains, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shurley very flaggy coarse sandy loam, native grassland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very flaggy coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; 20 percent flagstones, 20 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very flaggy coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; 20 percent channers, 20 percent flagstones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear irregular boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk--10 to 29 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very flaggy loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; 20 percent flagstones, 20 percent channers; common faint lime coatings on fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    BC--29 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very flaggy loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; 20 percent flagstones, 40 percent channers; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - hills, mountains, and alluvial fans.
Elevation - 4,500 to 6,500 feet.
Slope - 8 to 60 percent.
Parent material - material derived from gneiss, schist, and granite.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Shurley soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie sandreed, Indian ricegrass, basin wildrye, mountainmahogany, skunkbush sumac, and Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Shurley soils are moderately extensive in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Madison County, Montana, 1983.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0325. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the surface to 4 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 4 to 10 inches (Bw horizon); an accumulation of secondary carbonates from 10 to 29 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk, BC horizons). Shurley soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
