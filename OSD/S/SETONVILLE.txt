SETONVILLE SERIES

The Setonville series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum derived from granite.  Setonville soils are on footslopes of hills and knolls.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.  The Espiritu series, in a closely related family, does not have a calcic horizon and is not fragmental in the lower particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Setonville soils are on footslopes of hills and knolls. They formed in alluvium derived locally from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum of Precambrian granite bedrock. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arnor, Atalaya, and Enmedio soils. Arnor soils are fine-loamy, do not have calcic horizons and fragmental materials, and occur on toeslopes of hills. Atalaya soils are coarse-loamy over fragmental, do not have calcic horizons, and occur on beveled summits. Enmedio soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental, have mollic epipedons but do not have calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Setonville soils are used for urban development, cord wood products, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is bottlebrush squirreltail, black grama, oneseed juniper, and twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Juniperus monosperma-Pinus edulis/Fallugia parodoxa-Chrysothamnus nauseosus/Bouteloua hirsuta-Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB136NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Setonville soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 48A.
