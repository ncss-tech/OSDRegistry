SUTRO SERIES

The Sutro series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rocks. The Sutro soils are on hills and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sutro gravelly loam--woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; 5 percent stones and 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bw--15 to 36 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse and very coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, and common medium and coarse roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

    C--36 to 61 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) unrubbed and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) rubbed moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

    Cr--61 to 122 cm; soft metavolcanic rock.

TYPE LOCATION: Carson City, Nevada; about 8 miles east and 4 miles south of Carson City, Nevada; about 500 feet south and 1,500 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 34, T.15N., R.21E.; USGS Dayton 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 7 minutes 38 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 36 minutes 27 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.1272222 latitude,  -119.6075000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and early spring; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C. 
Mollic epipedon: 18 to 25 cm.
Depth to the paralithic contact: 50 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Less than 18 percent 
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent.

A1 horizon
Value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist,
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Structure: Weak fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is massive.

Bw borizon
Value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist,
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Texture:  Loam but is clay loam in some pedons.
Rock fragments: 10 to 20 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles.
Structure: Weak fine subangular or coarse subangular blocky structure, or it is massive.

C horizon: 
Value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist,
Chroma: 3 or 4.
Texture: Loam but is very fine sandy loam in some pedons.
Rock fragments: 5 to 20 percent gravel and cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Agency, Capona, Lovline and Quencheroo series.

Agency, Capona, Lovline and Quencheroo soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sutro soils are on hills at elevations of 1,485 to 1,830 meters. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rock that can be dug with hand tools. The climate is cool and arid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation, mostly snow, is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cagle, Koontz, Nosrac Tarloc and Xerta soils. Cagle soils have clayey argillic horizons.  Koontz soils are shallow over metavolcanic rocks. Nosrac soils have clay loam argillic horizons. Tarloc soils have coarse-loamy argillic horizons. Xerta soils have clayey argillic horizons and are shallow over basalt rock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Woodland and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is principally singleleaf pinyon and juniper with an understory of big sagebrush, ephedra, bitterbrush, desert peachbrush and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nevada. MLRA 26. These soils are of small extent.
