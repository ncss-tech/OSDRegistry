COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Broad Creek soils - fine-loamy soils that occur on estuarine tidal stream channel landforms; includes hypersulfidic materials and a buried A horizon.
Duvall Creek soils - sandy soils formed in stratified Holocene sands on submerged wave-built terrace landforms. 
Hillsmere soils - fine-loamy soils that occur on estuarine channel and mainland cove landforms; contains hypersulfidic materials.
Long Point soils - coarse-loamy soils that occur on submerged tidal marsh landforms; composed of Holocene sandy material and hemic organic material overlying a relatively intact paleosol; contains hypersulfidic materials.
Overboard soils - fine-loamy soils that occur on estuarine tidal stream Platform landforms; composed of Holocene fluid fine material overlying Tertiary fluviomarine deposits; includes a buried A horizon and has greater than 20% glauconite by volume in the fine earth fraction. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Subaqueous drainage
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high to very high throughout
Soil Moisture Regime: Peraquic
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water. The presence of hypersulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture.
Dominant Vegetation: Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain sub-estuaries of the western portion of the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Seaboard estuaries of Monmouth County, NJ. MLRA 149A. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2022.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is named for the South River, because it resembles the complex pedogenic history of the estuary exposing the eroded Tertiary aged fluviomarine deposits.  South River soils were formerly included with mapping as water.   

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2012):
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (Aseg and ACseg horizons)
Hyper-sulfidic materials - the zone from 0 to 70 centimeters incubated pH values less than 4 after 16 weeks.
Peraquic feature - the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters is permanently saturated
Argillic horizon - the zone from 70 to 89 centimeters (2Bt horizon)
Lithologic Discontinuity - the zone from 70 to 183 centimeters
