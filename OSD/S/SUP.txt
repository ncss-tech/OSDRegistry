SUP SERIES

The Sup series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic and andesitic rocks.   These soils are on concave mountain side slopes.  Slopes are l5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sup gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered with 2 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles, and 20 percent gravel.

(10 to 20 cm thick)

    C1--30 to 56 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine through coarse roots; few very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    C2--56 to 79 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3); extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (18 to 30 cm thick)

(15 to 25 cm thick)

    C4--99 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Basinpeak, Berrycreek, Decram, Fairydell, Foxmount, Gaia, Jackmill, Klug, Krackle, Lag, Middlehill, Rockabin, Steepshrub, Timmercrek, and Wareagle series.  

Basinpeak, Berrycreek, Decram, and Fairydell soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Foxmount, Krackle, Middlehill, and Rockabin soils are moderately deep. Gaia and Timmercrek soils are intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. Jackmill, Klug, Steepshrub and Wareagle soils have cambic horizons.  Lag soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 2 to 4 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sup soils are on concave mountain side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 2,135 to 2,750 meters.  The soils formed in colluvium from granitic and andesitic rock.  The climate is cold with most precipitation occurring during late fall, winter and spring.  Mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C; frost-free season is 50 to 60 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Genoa and Glean soils.  Genoa soils have an argillic horizon and a lithic contact at less than 50 cm.  Glean soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:   Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly curlleaf mountain mahogany, mountain big sagebrush, Nevada bluegrass, basin wildrye, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The soil is of moderate extent. MLRA 26.
