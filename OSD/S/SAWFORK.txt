SAWFORK SERIES

The Sawfork series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived dominantly from tuff.  Sawfork soils are on fan remnant side slopes and scarps of dissected pediments.  Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sawfork very cobbly loam - on a 35 percent southwest-facing slope in an area of rangeland. When described on October 2, 1985 the soil was slightly moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(3 to 5 inches thick)

    2Bk1--22 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) ashy sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent moderately cemented tuff paragravel; few fine carbonate masses in the matrix; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

    2Bk2--30 to 39 inches; white (10YR 8/1) extremely paragravelly ashy sandy clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent moderately cemented tuff paragravel; few fine carbonate masses in the matrix; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    2Bk3--39 to 48 inches; white (10YR 8/1) extremely paragravelly ashy sandy clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 75 percent moderately cemented tuff paragravel; few fine carbonate masses in the matrix; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the 2Bk horizons is 20 to 40 inches.)

    2Cr--48 to 52 inches; moderately cemented tuff.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Edgway, Kiote, Rolldown, Trespass, and Tusel series.
The Edgway, Kiote, Rolldown, and Trespass soils do not have a paralithic contact.
The Tusel soils do not have accumulations of secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sawfork soils are on fan remnant side slopes and scarps of dissected pediments.  Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent.  The soil formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived dominantly from tuff.  Elevation ranges from 8,800 to 10,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 11 to 16 inches, and most areas have mean annual precipitation of 14 inches or less.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 44 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is about 50 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gebson, Morset, and Hodden soils.  Gebson and Morset soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout. Hodden soils have sandy-skeletal substrata and formed in alluvium. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland.  Principal native vegetation consists of mountain muhly, Arizona fescue, slimstem muhly, blue grama, western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, and fringed sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Intermontane basins of central Colorado in areas of relatively low precipitation; MLRA 48B.  The series is of small extent.
