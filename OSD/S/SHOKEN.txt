SHOKEN SERIES

The Shoken series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granite.  These soils are on very steep convex mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic, shallow Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shoken very gravelly coarse sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent fine gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    C--3 to 13 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Cr--13 to 64 cm; soft, weathered granite; gradual wavy boundary.

    R--64 cm; hard granite

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada; about 2,050 feet north and 1250 feet east of the southwest corner of section 33, T. 8 N., R. 27 E.; USGS Mitchell Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 30 minutes 31 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 58 minutes 34 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.5086111 latitude, -118.9761111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture -Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry in summer through late fall; aridic bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature - 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact - 10 to 25 cm.
Depth to hard bedrock - 50 to 100 cm.
Control section - Clay content:  2 to 8 percent
Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent fine gravel

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3.

C horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture:  Gravelly coarse sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Petspring series.  Petspring soils are moist 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to summer convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shoken soils are on steep and very steep convex mountain slopes.  These soils formed in residuum from granite.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,463 to 1,707 meters.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 250 to 300 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golsum, Gosumi, Graley, Iver, Nomara, Pernty, and Sonocan series.  Golsum, Gosumi, Graley, Nomara, Pernty, and Sonocan soils have argillic horizons.  Iver soils have mollic epipedon that are 50 to 100 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid runoff; rapid permeability; very high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, desert peach, horsebrush, Eriogonum, needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Shoken soils are on low foothills of northwestern Nevada and are of small extent. MLAR 26, 27.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizon and feature recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 3 cm (A horizon).
Paralithic contact - The boundary at about 13 cm. (Cr layer)
Lithic contact - The boundary at about 64 cm (R layer).
Xeric feature - Aridic moisture regime bordering on Xeric.

Particle size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 13 cm (the A and C horizons).
