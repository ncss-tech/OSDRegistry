SKIDOOSPRINGS SERIES

The Skidoosprings series consists of deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks.  Skidoosprings soils are on high lake terraces occurring as remnant mounds in stream dissected areas.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Duric Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Skidoosprings sandy loam--on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 4,200 feet--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(4 to 13 inches thick)

(7 to 14 inches thick)

    Bnq--23 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; about 20 percent weakly cemented durinodes; strongly effervescent with disseminated lime; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    BCn--30 to 41 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few faint reddish brown masses of iron accumulation; strongly effervescent with disseminated lime; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bqm--41 to 49 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) cemented material, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; laminar opal coats on upper surface over matrix indurated by opal; strongly effervescent in upper one inch, noneffervescent below; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 12 inches thick)

    2C--49 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Parmele (T) series.  Parmele soils do not have indurated duripans at depths between 40 and 50 inches from the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skidoosprings soils are on high lake terraces occurring as remnant mounds in stream dissected areas.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fury, Opie, and Widowspring soils.  Fury soils are on stream terraces, have mollic epipedons, and are nonsaline and nonsodic.  Opie soils are on stream terraces and have mollic epipedons.  Widowspring soils are on stream terraces, have mollic epipedons, and are nonsaline and nonsodic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained;  moderately rapid permeability above the duripan, very slow permeability through the duripan.  A seasonal perched water table is at a depth of 0.5 feet above the soil surface to 2.5 feet below the soil surface from March through May.  Flooding is rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Skidoosprings soils are used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, black greasewood, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
