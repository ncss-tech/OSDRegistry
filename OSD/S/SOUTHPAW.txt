Reaction class: extremely acid to moderately acid

Bw horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR to 10YR; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 4 to 6
Texture: silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Progress, Eska, Ganhona, Kalambach, Mine, Sambrito, Steese, Tebay, and Tsana series. Progress soils have substantial amounts of mica. Ganhona soils formed in stratified alluvial materials and do not contain coarse fragments. Eska and Kalambach have a presumed mean annual soil temperature greater than 32 degrees F. Mine soils formed in alluvial materials and have less than 40 coarse fragments in the substrata.  Sambrito and Steese soils have a lithic contact at or above 60 inches. Tebay and Tsana soils have less than 40 percent rock fragments in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess over glacial till
Landform: glacial hills
Slope: 0 to 35 percent
Mean annual temperature: 24 to 28 degrees F., -4.4 to -2.2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 15 inches, 305 to 381 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Butchlake series. The Butchlake series has a thinner loess mantle and a loamy-skeletal control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the solum and high in substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: The native vegetation includes aspen and white spruce forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Highlands, Alaska The series is of moderate extent.
