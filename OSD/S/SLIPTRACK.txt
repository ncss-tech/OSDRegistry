SLIPTRACK SERIES

The Sliptrack series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from basalt. Sliptrack soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Durixerolls

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Oregon; about one mile southeast of Saddle Butte; approximately 2,400 feet south and 150 feet west of the northeast corner of section 23, T. 23 S., R. 18 E.; USGS Last Chance Lake 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 43 degrees 33 minutes 58 seconds N and longitude 120 degrees 30 minutes 59 seconds W NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section in winter and early spring, dry from late spring through early fall; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Greenmountain, Meld, and Milcan series. 

Greenmountain soils average 16 to 22 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Meld soils average 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Milcan soils do not have argillic horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sliptrack soils are in depressions on lava plateaus. These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,405 to 1,555 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Moonbeam and Oatmanflat soils. Moonbeam soils are clayey and shallow to duripans. Oatmanflat soils are deep to buried duripans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Sliptrack soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is low sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and scattered western juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 4,900 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
