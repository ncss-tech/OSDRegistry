SIMELAKE SERIES

The Simelake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvial deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are on flood plain flats.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES PROPOSED: Hardin County, Texas, 2013, MLRA 152B Soil Survey Update, Texas, 2013. The name is from Sime Lake, a small lake in Hardin County, Texas.
 
REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Estes and Urbo series. The Estes series is in MLRA 133B, at a higher elevation and in a shorter period of frost free days. The Urbo series is Southern Coastal Plain and the Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Areas.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in).
Ochric  epipedon: 0 to 15  cm (0 to 6 in). (A horizon) 
Cambic horizon: 15 to 54 cm (6 to 21 in) (Bw horizon)
Slickensides: 54 to 203 cm (21 to 80 in) (Bss, Bssg1, Bssg2 horizons)
Aquic conditions:  15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in) 

Additional Comments: The mineralogy is based on lab data from the type location.

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data available on pedon S12TX1991026. Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 8 pedons.
