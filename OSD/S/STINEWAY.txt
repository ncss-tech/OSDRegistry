STINEWAY SERIES

The Stineway series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from metamorphic rock. Stineway soils are on hills and mountains with slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Mollic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Stineway very gravelly sandy loam, on a 47 percent west-southwest slope, under grass and shrub vegetation. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described (5/4/82) the soil was slightly moist below 6 inches.

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 3 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles, and 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films bridging mineral grains, in pores and on faces of peds; 2 percent stones, 12 percent cobbles, and 28 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.
(1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt2--6 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films in pores and on faces of peds; 2 percent stones, 23 percent cobbles, and 25 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    R--16 inches; hard, highly fractured schist bedrock.


TYPE LOCATION: Kern County, California. About 0.75 mile north of Stineway Cove on the north side of Lake Isabella; 200 feet north and 900 feet east of the southwest corner of section 2, T.26S., R.33E., MDB&M;  Lake Isabella North California Quadrangle, lat. 35 degrees 40 minutes and 54 seconds N. and long. 118 degrees 24 minutes and 45 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry in all parts from May 1 through November 15 (about 200 days). It is periodically moist in some part from November 15 to May 1 (about 165 days) and moist in all parts for about 100 consecutive days when the soil temperature is above 46 degrees F.  It is xeric but borders on aridic.

Soil temperature - The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.

The depth to bedrock is 8 to 20 inches.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.

A horizon
    Texture: very gravelly sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam
             or very gravelly loam with 15 to 50
             percent coarse  fragments, dominantly gravel.
    Value: 4, or 5 dry and 3 moist.
    Chroma: 2 or 3 dry and moist.
    Organic Matter: 1 to 3 percent.

Bt horizon
     Texture: very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly loam
              or very gravelly loam with 35 to 55 percent
              coarse fragments, dominantly gravel and
              cobbles.
     Value: 4,5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.
     Chroma: 3 or 4 dry and 2, 3 or 4 moist.
     Clay content: 12 to 25 percent
     Organic matter: .5 to 2 in the upper part and
                     .2 to 1 in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Pardee series.  Pardee soils have hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stineway soils are on hills and mountains with slopes of 5 to 75 percent. They formed in material weathered from metamorphic rock. Elevations are 2,600 to 5,000 feet. Rock outcrop is often associated with these soils. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F. The frost-free season is 175 to 225 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canebrake and Xyno soils. Canebrake soils are sandy, lack an argillic horizon, and have mesic soil temperature regimes. Xyno soils are sandy and lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and watershed. The vegetation is mainly California buckwheat, red brome and  filaree  and a few scattered juniper and digger pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Sierra Nevada mountains in California. The series is of small extent in MLRAs 29 and 18.
