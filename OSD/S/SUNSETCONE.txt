SUNSETCONE SERIES

The Sunsetcone series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra. Sunsetcone soils are on north-facing slopes on cinder cones.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent. The permeability is moderately rapid. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over pumiceous or cindery, amorphic over glassy Humic Xeric Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON: Sunsetcone gravelly medial loam - on a 40 percent slope at an elevation of 5,960 feet in forestland. When described on November 9, 1997, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Oi--0 to 1 inch; Slighly decomposed Douglas-fir needles and twigs, fibric. (1 to 4 inches thick)

	Oe--1 to 2 inches; Moderately decomposed Douglas-fir needles and root mat, hemic. (1 to 3 inches thick)

	A1--2 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly medial loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; about 20 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

	A2--6 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly medial loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; about 15 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

	AB--8 to 12 inches; 70 percent brown (10YR 5/3) and 30 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly medial loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; about 35 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

	Bw--12 to 26 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly medial sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grained; loose; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; about 35 percent gravel-size cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

	2C1--26 to 32 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) cobbles, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single-grained; loose; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; common medium and coarse interstitial pores; 70 percent cobble-size cinders and 20 percent gravel-size cinders; gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

	2C2--32 to 62 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravel, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single-grained; loose; many very fine, fine, and medium and few coarse interstitial pores; 85 percent gravel-size cinders and 10 percent cobble-size cinders.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sunsetcone soils are on north-facing slopes on cinder cones.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,500 feet. The soil formed in wind deposited volcanic tephra and loess. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain. The mean annual air temperature is about 37 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hal and Grassycone soils. Grassycone and Hal soils lack the cinders above 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Rapid runoff. Moderately rapid over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for wildlife and limited rangeland. Vegetation is Douglas fir, mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, bitterbrush and scattered limber pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Idaho. This series is small extensive.
