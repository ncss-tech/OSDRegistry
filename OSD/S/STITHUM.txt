STITHUM SERIES

The Stithum series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on mountain valley, eroded alluvial terraces. Stithum soils formed in colluvium mixed with a small amount of volcanic ash, overlying alluvium from mixed lithologies.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.
