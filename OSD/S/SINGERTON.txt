SINGERTON SERIES

The Singerton series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material high in carbonates and gypsum which weathered from calcareous, gypsiferous shales.  These nearly level tomoderately steep soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 33 centimeters (13 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Singerton loam in a cultivated area. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots, common very fine pores; calcareous; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches) thick)

  ACk--15 to 38 centimeters (6 to 15 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) clay loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak moderate and fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots and pores; 5 percent fine gravel; visible secondary calcium carbonate in streaks and spots; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) thick)

  Ckl--38 to 66 centimeters (15 to 26 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) clay loam, olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) moist; massive hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 5 percent fine gravel; few very fine roots, common very fine pores; visible secondary calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate in streaks and spots; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 64 centimeters (8 to 25 inches) thick)

  Ck2--66 to 89 centimeters (26 to 35 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) clay loam, olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) moist; massive hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 5 percent fine gravel; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; visible secondary calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate in streaks and spots few small gypsum crystals; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 51 centimeters (O to 20 inches) thick)

  C--89 to 152 centimeters (35 to 60 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) clay loam, olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 10 percent fine gravel and shale chips; many gypsum crystals; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Kiowa County, Colorado; about 14 kilometers (9 miles) south and 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of Haswell; 366 meters (1,200 feet) east of the southwest corner of Sec. 10, T. 20 S., R. 52 W.

Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C. (53 to 59 degrees F.) 
Depth to calcic horizon: 15 to 64 centimeters (6 to 25 inches) 
Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent 
Silt Content: 20 to 55 percent 
Sand content: 15 to 55 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent 
Size: gravel

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value: of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value: 6 to 8, 5 to 7 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 6
Note: Discontinuous layers of gypsum crystals are in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are the Chew and Dean series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: weathered, buff colored, calcareous shale high in gypsiferous material 
Landform: uplands 
Slope: 1 to 10 percent 
Mean annual temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C. (52 degrees to 57 degrees F.) 
Mean annual precipitation: 30 to 38 centimeters (12 to 15 inches) 
Frost free Period: 155 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fort Collins, Narvey, Stoneham and Pultney soils.
Fort Collins and Stoneham soils have an argillic horizon.
Harvey soils have less than 40 percent carbonates.
Pultney soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: medium 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  moderately high or high 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used primarily for native grazing land and wheat production.  
Native vegetation is Blue grama and galleta which dominate the rangeland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Colorado.  The series is moderately extensive.
