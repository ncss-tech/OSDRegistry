COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baldy (AZ) and Emestine (AK) soils.
Baldy soils have a mean annual temperature of 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F) and occur at elevations between 2743 to 3503 m (9000 and 11500 ft).
Emestine soils are well drained, have sandy till parent material, and occur on mountain slopes.
