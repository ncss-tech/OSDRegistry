STANBERRY SERIES 

The Stanberry series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are deep to a densic contact. These soils formed in loamy alluvium underlain by dense sandy or loamy lodgement till on disintegration moraines. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, moderately slow in the lower part and slow in the dense till. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Oxyaquic Haplorthods

USGS quadrangle; lat. 46 degrees, 8 minutes, 3 seconds N., and long. 91 degrees, 35 minutes, 21 seconds W.; NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and in the argillic horizon. The content of sand coarser than very fine averages 35 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, 0 to 25 percent in the lower part and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the loamy alluvium and from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations are below the spodic horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in normal years.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Annalake, Beaverbay, Chequamegon, Goodwit, Gulliver, Loggerhead, Padwood, Sarwet, Shoepac, Spiderlake, and Tipler series.  Annalake, Goodwit, Gulliver, Loggerhead, Padwood, Sarwet, Shoepac, Spiderlake, and Tipler soils do not have a densic contact within the series control section. Beaverbay and Chequamegon soils have a 12 to 36 inch mantle with more than 50 percent silt. Chequamegon soils average more than 7 percent clay in the dense till.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material:  Formed in loamy alluvium underlain by dense sandy or loamy lodgement till.
Landform: Disintegration moraines.
Slope: 1 to 30 percent.
Elevation: 1000 to 1500 feet.
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches.
Frost-free days: 110 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beaverbay, Frogcreek, Parkfalls, Stinnett, and Wozny soils. The moderately well drained Beaverbay and Frogcreek soils are on similar landscape positions, but have a silty mantle. The somewhat poorly drained Parkfalls soils form a hydrosequence with the Stanberry soils. The somewhat poorly drained Stinnett soils are on lower or less sloping landscape positions and have a silty mantle. The very poorly drained Wozny soils are in depressions and have a silty mantle.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is low to high. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the loamy alluvium, moderately slow in the lower part, and slow in the dense till. Stanberry soils have seasonal saturation perched above the densic contact at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly in woodland. Common trees are red maple, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, paper birch, and northern red oak with eastern hophornbeam, bigtooth aspen, white ash and yellow birch as associates in most stands. Some areas are cleared and used for pastureland or cropland. Corn, small grains, and hay are the common crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Wisconsin. LRR K and MLRA 90A. The soil is of small extent.
