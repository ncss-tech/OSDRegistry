STEVIE SERIES 

The Stevie series consists of very deep, excessively  drained soils formed in colluvium with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Udivitrands 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stevie gravelly silt loam, forested (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and partially decomposed forest litter. 

    A--1 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium and common very fine and coarse roots; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw1--2 to 8 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to fine and medium granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium and common very fine and coarse roots; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bw2--8 to 18 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick) 

    2E/Bw--18 to 43 inches; E part (80 percent) is grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry, Bw part (20 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 30 inches thick) 

    2C--43 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse roots; 40 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2)
