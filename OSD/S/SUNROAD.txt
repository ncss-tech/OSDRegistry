SUNROAD SERIES 

The Sunroad series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over alluvium or outwash derived from metasedimentary rock.  These soils occur on alluvial fans and outwash terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,000 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Andic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Sunroad medial sandy loam, in coniferous forest. This profile was described on a 2 percent slope at 1,023 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter 

    Oe--4 to 12 cm; moderately decomposed forest litter 

    E--12 to 16 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) medial sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw1--16 to 24 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) medial sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--24 to 38 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) medial sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary.

    2C1--38 to 59 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.3). 

    2C2--59 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
