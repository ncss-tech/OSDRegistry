SCOSSA SERIES

The Scossa series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Scossa soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scossa soils are on alluvial fans adjacent to seeps.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,435 to 1,590 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mottsville and Ophir soils.  These soils are sandy, do not have Histic epipedons, and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Very poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Scossa soils are used for pasture and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly sedges and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Histic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (Oe1 and Oe2 horizons).
Umbric epipedon - The zone from 20 to 41 cm (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and A6  horizons).
Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 25 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, and Cg horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 50 to 125 cm (A4, A5, A6 and part of the A3 and Cq horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S01NV-005-003 (pedon # 02N0632).  Selected data are available.
