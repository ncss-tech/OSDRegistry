SCHOER SERIES

The Schoer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Schoer soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Schoer loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 5 percent gravel.

     2Bt--41 to 58 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; hard, friable, very sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores and common pressure faces; 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

     3Bt--58 to 84 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few very faint clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 38 cm thick)

     4C--84 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brownscombe, Bucklake, Cagle, Correco, Holmzie, Jasseek, Northmore, Perla, Sherar, Wicup and Zymans. 

Bucklake, Brownscombe, Cagle, Holmzie, Perla, Sherar and Wicup soils are 50 to 100 cm to bedrock. Correco soils are slightly or medium acid throughout, have argillic horizons that have more than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand and depth to base of the argillic horizon is 66 to 163 cm.  Jasseek soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Northmore soils are slightly acid or neutral and lack very gravelly coarse sand within 100 cm. Zymans soils lack very gravelly coarse sand within 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Schoer soils are on fan piedmonts. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,740 to 1,955 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Heechee and Welch series.  Heechee soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and Welch soils are very poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; slow over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Antelope bitterbrush, Thurber needlegrass, needleandthread. Irrigated areas are in alfalfa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Nevada. MLRA 25. These soils are not extensive.
