SHEDHORN SERIES

The Shedhorn series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium or glacial till derived from consolidated shale or sandstone.  These soils are on glacial moraines, mountainsides, and foot slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shedhorn clay loam, grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots and common coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent angular sandstone pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots and common coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent angular shale and sandstone pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--12 to 40 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) light clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots and few coarse roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; thin very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist organic coatings on faces of peds; 10 percent angular shale and sandstone pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (28 to 32 inches thick)

    BC--40 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine, very fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent angular shale pebbles.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shedhorn soils are on mountain slopes and glacial moraines.  Elevations are 6,000 to 9,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  These soils formed under grass cover in colluvium and glacial till derived from consolidated shale and sandstone.  The climate is cold.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 70 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used as rangeland and for wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bearded wheatgrass, mountain brome, basin wildrye, Columbia needlegrass, forbs, and shrubs.  A few areas have tree cover consisting mainly of Douglas-fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The high mountainous areas of southwestern Montana.  This series is inextensive.
