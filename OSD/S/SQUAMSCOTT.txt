SQUAMSCOTT SERIES

The Squamscott series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in sandy materials overlying loamy sediments on marine or lacustrine plains or terraces.  Permeability is rapid in the upper part of the soil and moderately slow in the lower part.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Epiaquods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Squamscott fine sandy loam - on a nearly level area in woodland.  The surface is covered by a one inch layer of loose needles, leaves, and twigs.(Colors are for moist soil.)

(Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 4 to 20 inches).

    2C1--21 to 38 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) silt loam; massive; firm; few fine vesicular pores; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) and many medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

    2C2--38 to 67 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silt loam; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) stains on faces of peds; common medium prominent gray (5Y 5/1) iron depletions in the upper part; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rockingham County, New Hampshire; Town of Brentwood, 1200 feet at 185 degrees from the intersection of NH Route 101 and North Road; latitude 43 degrees 00 minutes 49 seconds North, longitude 71 degrees, 01 minutes, 57 seconds West, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 27 inches.  The clay content in the contrasting 2C horizon ranges from 22 to 35 percent.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through neutral, with acidity generally decreasing with depth.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil.  Structure is granular or subangular blocky in the solum.  The 2C horizon is massive or has angular blocky geologic structure.

The 0 horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.

The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon that ranges from 4 to 10 inches thick.

The Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand.

The Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  

The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.

Some pedons have a C horizon above the 2C horizon that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.

The 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, but many pedons have thin lenses or bands of loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or silty clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in the same family.  The Avoca, Coveytown, Enosburg, Rapson, Shaker, and Swanton series in related families.  Avoca and Rapson soils are from outside of Region R.  They both have free carbonates in the 2C horizons.  Coveytown, Enosburg, Shaker, and Swanton soils do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Coveytown and Swanton soils have frigid temperature regimes.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Squamscott soils are in low-lying, concave positions on marine or lacustrine plains or terraces.  They formed in marine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent, but is predominantly less than 3 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boxford, Eldridge, Maybid, Pipestone, Raynham, Saugatuck, Scitico, and Whately soils.  Pipestone and Saugatuck soils are sandy throughout and Scitico and Raynham soils are loamy throughout.  These soils are on similar landscape position.  Eldridge and Boxford soils are moderately well drained and are on adjacent, higher landscape positions.  Maybid and Whately soils are very poorly drained and are in lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Permeability is rapid above the lithologic discontinuity and moderately slow below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in woodland.  Principle trees are white pine and red maple.  Some areas that are drained are in cropland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  New Hampshire and New York (MLRA 144A).  The series is of small extent.
