SANCAJO SERIES

The Sancajo series consists of soils that are shallow over a petrocalcic horizon.  These well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous sediments of the Catahoula Formation.  These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils are on are convex interfluves and ridges on inland, dissected plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

Choke and Eloso soils: very deep and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  
Pavelek soils: are clayey and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the solum.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, high on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and very high on 5 to 8 percent slopes.  Permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of short grasses and about 15 percent woody plants and 5 percent forbs.  Woody plants include persimmon, guajillo, cenizo, mountain laurel, paloverde, agarita, and pricklypear cactus.  Grasses are Wright threeawn, slim tridens, sideoats grama, plains bristlegrass, buffalograss, and plains lovegrass. (Shallow Ridge ecological site, PZ 20-25, R083CY485TX).
