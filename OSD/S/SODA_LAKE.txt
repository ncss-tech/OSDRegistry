SODA LAKE SERIES

The Soda Lake series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash, basaltic lapilli, and in alluvium derived mainly from basalt.  Soda Lake soils are on alluvial fans and barrier beaches adjacent to volcanic cones.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aneth, Luning, Shumbegay, Soolake, and Yerington series.

Aneth soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, are intermittently moist in some part from July to October following convection storms, and have Bk horizons below 50 cm.  Luning soils have strata with more than 35 percent rock fragments and do not have Bk horizons.  Shumbegay soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and are intermittently moist in some part from July to October following convection storms.  Soolake soils have strata of silt loam, have less than 5 percent rock fragments, and have mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 12 degrees C.  Yerington soils have Bqk horizons in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Soda Lake soils are on alluvial fans and barrier beaches adjacent to volcanic cones.  They formed in volcanic ash, basaltic lapilli, and in alluvium derived mainly from basalt along with some granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,219 to 1,280 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 130 to 145 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Appian and Isolde soils.  Appian soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have natric horizons.  Isolde soils are sandy and occur on stable dunes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained with some areas altered to somewhat poorly drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The altered drainage is due to excessive seepage from irrigation canals that traverse the area and irrigation water losses.  In these areas the water table fluctuates from a high of 3 feet during the peak of the irrigation season to about 10 feet during the winter months when the canals are dry.  In other areas the water table is below 10 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soda Lake soils are used for livestock grazing and irrigated cropland.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, fourwing saltbush, Bailey's greasewood, and bud sagebrush in the better drained areas and black greasewood in the more poorly drained areas.  Alfalfa, corn, pasture, small grains, and melons are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRAs 27 and 29.
