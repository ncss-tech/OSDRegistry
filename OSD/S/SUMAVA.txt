COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Shiawassee series is in a similar family and has a semiactive cation-exchange activity class. Shiawassee soils have dense till that is root and water restrictive in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sumava soils are on swells on moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Sumava soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy outwash and the underlying till. The upper material is thought to be a mixture of windblown sand and outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is177 to 466 meters  (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ayr, Barry, Corwin, Gilford, Nesius, Parr, and Ridgeville soils. The well drained Ayr and Parr soils and the moderately well drained Corwin and Nesius soils are on higher lying landform positions. The poorly drained Barry soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford soils are in depressions and swales. The somewhat poorly drained Ridgeville soils are on similar landform positions and have more sand in the lower part of the series control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 91 cm (1 to 3 feet) for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderately rapid in the outwash and moderate in the till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly used to grow corn, soybeans, and small grain. Native vegetation is prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 99, 110, and 111C in northwestern Indiana and southeastern Michigan. The series is of small extent.
