SERIES ESTABLISHED: New Hanover County, North Carolina; 1974.

REMARKS: 08/1985. The classification of the Seagate series is revised to comply with the addition of Cation-exchange activity classes in Soil Taxonomy.
02/2008. Seagate soils typically do not have sufficient organic carbon content in the spodic horizon for classification in the Humod suborder. Additional information is needed to determine the correct taxonomic placement. The most likely classification is Oxyaquic Alorthods; however, the Alorthods great group is being studied and major revision is anticipated. Seagate soils will remain as historically classified until a future investigation can be completed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 centimeters (Ap and E horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 20 to 30 centimeters (E horizon)
Spodic horizon--the zone between depths of 30 and 58 centimeters (Bh horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone between depths of 71 to 168 centimeters (Bt and Btg horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters
