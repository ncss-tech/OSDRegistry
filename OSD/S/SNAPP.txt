SNAPP SERIES

The Snapp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Snapp soils are on fans piedmont remnants and rock pediment remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, smectitic over mixed, mesic Durinodic Xeric Natrargids

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Snapp soils are on fan piedmont remnants and rock pediment remnants.  Snapp soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beoska, Midas, Orovada, and Theodor soils.  Beoska soils have a fine-loamy argillic horizon.  Midas soils lack an argillic horizon.  Orovada soils lack an argillic horizon and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Theodor soils have an aridic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well-drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Thurber needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  Snapp soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA 24 and 25.
