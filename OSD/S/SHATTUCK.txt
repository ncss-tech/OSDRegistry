SHATTUCK SERIES

The Shattuck series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over material weathered from quartzite. Shattuck soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Flumecreek series. Flumecreek series have moderate permeability.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Shattuck soils are on mountain slopes and ridges, have elevations of 1,800 to 4,800 feet and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over material weathered from quartzite.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches and the frost-free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bouldercreek, Dworshak, Kruse, and Teakean soils.  Bouldercreek soils occur on mountain slopes and lack an argillic horizon.  Dworshak soils occur on mountain slopes and are in an Ashy over loamy family. Kruse soils occur on mountain slopes, ridges and canyon sides. They have a xeric moisture regime and a vitrandic surface. Teakean soils occur on mountain slopes.  They have a xeric moisture regime and a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used mainly for timber production, woodland grazing, wildlife habitat and watershed.  The natural vegetation is western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western larch with an understory of queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, western rattlesnake platain, baldhip rose, common snowberry, and Myrtle pachystima. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central, Idaho; Shattuck soils are not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
