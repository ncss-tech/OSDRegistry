SPRINGCOVE SERIES

Springcove series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  Springcove soils occur on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrixeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Springcove silt loam - on a south-facing slope of 1 percent in native rangeland.  When described on August 30, 1988, the soil was dry to 8 inches and moist below that depth. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Longbilly (T) series.  Longbilly soils have E horizons, have average annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F., and have SAR of 15 to 45 in the natric horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Springcove soils are on stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation is 2,900 to 3,400 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 46 to 51 degrees F. and the frost free period is 100 to 140 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; runoff is very slow; permeability is slow.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jansite (T), Loupence (T), Power, Purdam, and Quencheroo (T) soils.  Jansite soils have mollic epipedons.  Loupence, Power, Purdam, and Quencheroo soils do not have natric horizons.  Jansite, Loupence, and Quencheroo soils occur on the same landscape.  Power and Purdam soils occur on basalt plains.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Springcove soils are used for irrigated cropland, pasture, hayland, and limited amount of rangeland.  Native vegetation consists of greasewood and saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Springcove soils are of small extent in southcentral Idaho.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gooding County, Idaho, 1993.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 5 inches (Anz1 and Anz2 horizons)

Natric horizon - 5 to 32 inches (Btnz, Btn1, and Btn2 horizons)

Xeric moisture regime - These soils receive additional moisture from run-on because of their position on the landscape
