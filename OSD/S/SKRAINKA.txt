SKRAINKA SERIES

The Skrainka series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium or colluvium and residuum weathered primarily from basic igneous rocks. These soils are on basin-floor remnants. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Skrainka silt loam - on a shoulder position of a high undulating terrace with 5 percent slope in fescue and clover pasture at an elevation of 830 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	2C2--68 to 80 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) sandy loam; massive; friable; many black specks (magnetite); few white lithochromic mottles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alsup, Goodson, Losantville, Miamian, Morrisville, Shircliff, Useful, and Vincent series. Alsup and Goodson soils have a paralithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. Losantville soils have free carbonates at 8 to 20 inches. Miamian soils have free carbonates from 18 to 40 inches.Morrisville soils have free carbonates at 10 to 30 inches. Shircliff soils have free carbonates at 30 to 60 inches. Useful soils have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. Vincent soils formed in lacrustine deposits with a very low sand content in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skrainka soils are on basin-floor remnants and platforms consisting of terraces, footslopes, and ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. The soils are primarily developed in colluvium and residuum derived from from basic igneous rocks. The upper material includes colluvial additions from arkose sandstone and acid igneous rocks. The lower material is derived from intrusive mafic rocks which include diabase, basalt, and gabbro. This material is colluvium which may grade with depth to highly weathered residuum below a former strath surface. Mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 to 48 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Ashton, Delassus, Elk, Irondale, Lamotte, Nolin, Syenite, and Taumsauk series. Ashton and Elk soils are fine-silty and are on lower terraces. Delassus have a low base saturation, are fine-loamy and have a fragipan. They are commonly at higher elevations. Irondale, Syenite, and Taumsauk soils are at higher elevations and formed in materials primarily derived from acid igneous rocks. Syenite is fine loamy. Irondale, and Taumsauk are loamy-skeletal and are on steeper sideslopes. Lamotte soils formed in acid sandstone and are fine-loamy. They are at similar elevations on basin ridges. Nolin soils are fine-silty and are on flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff potential is medium. Permeability is moderately slow. A wet zone is in this soil at a depth of 2 to 3.5 feet during parts of December through April in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in grasses and legumes. The soils are used for pasture and hay. Other areas are in forest and a few areas are used for grain production. Native vegetation was native grasses and hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The St. Francis Mountains region of the Missouri Ozarks (MLRA 116C). The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Madison County, Missouri, 1998. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 6 inches. (Ap horizon)Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 33 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons).This series was originally proposed as a Mollic Hapludalf, but the Oxyaquic subgroup supercedes the Mollic subgroup in the current Keys to Taxonomy.
