        Oi--0 to 5 inches (0 to 13 cm); dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear wavy boundary.

        A/Oajj--5 to 8 inches (13 to 20 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) and black (10YR 2/1) mucky silt loam and muck; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.5); diffuse broken boundary.

        2A/Cfjj--8 to 13 inches (20 to 33 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) permanently frozen very cobbly loam; common very fine and fine roots; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); diffuse broken boundary.

TYPE LOCATION: Delta River Area, Alaska; about 5.5 miles below Juneau Falls along the Delta River, UTM coordinates: Zone 6, Easting 560924, Northing 7009374.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: shallow to permafrost
Drainage class: poorly drained
Landforms: earth hummocks on mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly cryoturbate
Elevation: 2,533 to 3,488 feet (772 to 1,063 m)
Slope: 10 to 65 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches (700 to 848 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 60 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Basaltlake and Petrokov soils. Basaltlake soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains. Petrokov soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, and occur on mountains and outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high above the permafrost and very low in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is shrub birch-mixed ericaceous shrub/sedge scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
