SHALOWOOD SERIES

The Shalowood series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapid to moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy colluvium from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age over mudstone, sandstone, siltstone, or shale residuum of Permian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to steep hills and hillslopes in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA-77E).  The slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Shalowood loam - on a north facing 4 percent convex slope in native rangeland at an elevation of 764 m (2505 ft).

Alopark, Mansic, Mocane, Oklark, and Woods series occur on adjacent landscapes within thicker deposits of the Laverne (Valentine) member of the Ogallala formation that comprise the entire soil profile.  
Oklark and Mansic soils have a mollic epipedon.  
Alopark soils: have a coarse-loamy particle-size class, and are very deep
Mansic and Oklark soils: have a mollic epipedon, and are very deep 
Mocane soils: have a sandy particle-size class, and are very deep
Woods soils: have a mollic epipedon, a fine particle-size class, and slickensides within 100 cm (40 in) of the soil surface, and are very deep

Alowood soils: occur on the same landscape, and have a paralithic contact with Permian-age residuum within 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) of the soil surface, and have a fine-silty particle size control section

Deepwood, Quinlan, and Woodward soils occur on lower landscapes and were formed in residuum from Permian shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  
Woodward, Quinlan, and Deepwood soils: do not have a covering mantle of Ogallala colluvial sediments, and do not have a calcic horizon 

Dreyfoos soils: occur on higher landscapes in eolian sands, have textures coarser than loamy fine sand throughout, and do not have coarse fragments

Drainage class: well Drained
Permeability: moderate
Runoff: low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, medium on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and high on greater than 20 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: Largely in native range and used for grazing livestock and wildlife.  Native vegetation includes little bluestem, blue grama, sand dropseed, sideoats grama, and buffalograss.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E in LRR H) of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and counties in northwestern Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. Distribution is bounded to the south by the Salt Fork of the Red River and to the north by the Cimarron River.  This soil is moderately extensive.
