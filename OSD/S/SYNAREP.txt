SYNAREP SERIES

The Synarep soil consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with calcareous alluvium. The soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic Typic Vitrixerands 

TYPICAL PEDON: Synarep ashy silt loam, cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.) 

        Ap--0 to 8 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) ashy silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common roots; common fine and medium pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 9 inches thick) 

        Bw--8 to 33 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) ashy silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common roots; fine and medium pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (24 to 36 inches thick) 

        BC--33 to 46 inches; gray (N 6/) ashy silt loam, dark gray (N 4/) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few roots; common fine and medium pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (12 to 14 inches thick) 

        2C--46 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6). 

TYPE LOCATION: Okanogan County, Washington; 1.5 miles northeast of Keystone, Keystone quadrangle; 660 feet west and 900 feet south of the northeast corner of the southeast quarter  of section 34, T.36N., R.27E., WM. (Latitude 48 Degrees, 34 minutes 19 seconds north., Longitude, 119 degrees, 26 minutes, 18 seconds west. [NAD83])

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
 
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 52 degrees F. 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
The solum is calcareous throughout 

A horizon
Value: 4 to 6 dry,  2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 0 to 2 dry or moist. 


Bw and BC horizons
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 0 to 2 moist or dry
Texture: ashy silt loam or ashy very fine sandy loam
 

2C horizon
Texture: Stratified very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, and may have 2 to 3 inch layers of gravelly sand.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Thowson series.  Thowson soils are non effervescent.  Thowson soils are on mountains and formed in volcanic ash and pumice over ablation glacial till.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Synarep soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation is 1,500 to 3,000 feet. The soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with calcareous alluvium. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation 12 to 15 inches. The frost free season is 100 to 125 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Conconully and Molson soils. Conconully and Molson soils have mollic epipedons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Hay, pasture and range. Native vegetation is salt grass, basin wild ryegrass, bluegrass, and small shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Washington; MLRA 43A. The Synarep series is inextensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Okanogan County, Washington, 1972.
 
REMARKS:Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: zone from 0 to 8 inches
Cambic horizon: zone from 8 to 33 inches
Andic soil properties: zone from 0 to 46 inches
The series needs laboratory data to verify andic soil properties.  This soil is mapped in areas where other series having thick black surfaces are classified as Andisols (Molson, Havallah, Koepke) and these soils also need andic soil property analysis
