SLIGO SERIES

The Sligo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Oxyaquic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Sligo loam, on a 1 percent slope in a meadow. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; many fine and common medium roots; many faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coatings on faces of peds and in root and worm channels; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick]

 C1--23 to 63 cm (9 to 25 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; common faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coatings on faces of peds and in root channels; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

 C2--63 to 79 cm (25 to 31 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) organic coatings on faces of peds and in root channels; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation throughout; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 C3--79 to 91 cm (31 to 36 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) organic coatings on ped faces and in root channels; common fine faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation throughout; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 C4--91 to 124 cm (36 to 49 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; many medium faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation throughout; 2 percent gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the C horizon is 61 to 140 cm (24 to 55 inches).]

 Cg1--124 to 147 cm (49 to 58 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy coarse sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common medium distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation throughout; 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 61 cm (24 inches) thick]

 C'--147 to 168 cm (58 to 66 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) coarse sand; single grain; loose; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation throughout; 6 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Cg2--168 to 193 cm (66 to 76 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation throughout; 50 percent gravel consisting of granite, some flint and limestone; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Cg3--193 to 203 cm (76 to 80 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; 65 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Clinton County, Ohio; about 5.5 miles north northeast of Blanchester, in Vernon Township; about 180 feet south of the junction of OH 730 and Reeder Road along OH 730, then about 740 feet west; USGS Blanchester, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat 39 degrees 23 minutes 39 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 56 minutes 30 seconds W., NAD 27

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Kinn series is in a closely related family. Kinn soils have carbonates in the upper part of the series control section and have a buried soil within the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Sligo soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1016 mm (33 to 40 inches), and mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Shoals, the very poorly drained Sloan, and the well drained Stringley soils. The Sloan and Shoals soils are in depressions or on lower lying areas. The Stringley soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 76 to 107 cm (2.5 to 3.5 feet) between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate. Flooding is rare to common.

USE AND VEGETATION: Sligo soils are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Ohio; MLRAs 111D and 114A. The type location is in MLRA 114A. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clinton County, Ohio, 1999.

REMARKS: These soils historically have been classified as Entisols based largely on landform position. The typical pedon is described with properties that are typical of cambic horizons. The presence of a cambic horizon would place these soils in the Oxyaquic Eutrudepts classification.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 63 cm.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for this soil is available through The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, pedon CT-88.
