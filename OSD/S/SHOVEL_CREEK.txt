Hollow soils are calcareous in the control section, are somewhat poorly drained, have frequent flooding frequency, and occur on flood plains and outwash plains.
Kidazqeni soils have a thin mantle of stratified loamy and sandy alluvium at depths between 2 to 8 cm (1 to 3 in), are moderately well or well drained, and occur on flood plains, stream terraces, and alluvial fans.
Malmesbury soils have olive to olive grey moist colors in at depths below 51 cm (20 in), buried O horizons, a mean annual air temperature of 7 degrees C. (45 degrees F.), and occur on flood plains and stream terraces.
