SPANTARA SERIES

The Spantara series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in sandy, eolian and alluvial sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on level to slightly undulating plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 432mm (17 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Haplustalfs

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for 180 to 270 days, cumulative, in normal years. November through April are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in May through October. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F).
Depth to argillic horizon: 25 to 64 cm (10 to 25 in).
Depth to secondary carbonates: 64 to 152 cm (25 to 60 in).
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in).

Particle-size control section: less than 18 percent silicate clay.
Clay content decreases by more than 20 percent from the maximum within 152 cm (60 in) of the surface.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Similar soils are the Ady, Amarillo, Amarose, Brownfield, Elida, Patricia, and Triomas series. 
Ady, Amarillo, Brownfield and Patricia soils: have more than 18 percent clay in the soil texture control-section.
Amarose, Elida and Triomas soils: are drier in the soil moisture control-section for longer periods.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandy eolian and alluvial sediments of the Blackwater Draw 
Formation of Pleistocene age.
Landform: level to slightly undulating plains.
Slopes: 1 to 5 percent. 
Mean annual temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 406 to 483 mm (16 to 19 in). 
Frost-free period: 180 to 200 days. 
Elevation: 792 to 1463 m (2,600 to 4,800 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 23 to 28.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amarillo, Gomez,  and Nutivoli  series. 
Amarillo  soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Gomez soils: are on similar and slightly lower landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon.
Nutivoli soils: occur on higher landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for cropland but also used as native rangeland. Principal crops grown are cotton and grain sorghum. Climax vegetation is tall and mid grasses, with tall grasses tending to dominate. This site is dominated by little bluestem and sand bluestem along with taller dropseed species. The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn. Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (077CY035TX) range site in Texas.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern part of the High Plains of Texas and east-central New Mexico (sub MLRA 77C). The soil is of moderate extent.
