SULLY SERIES

The Sully series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in loess on the uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, calcareous, mesic Typic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sully silt loam - on southwest-facing slope of 9 percent under native grass. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 centimeters (2 to 7 inches) thick)

   AC--8 to 51 centimeters (3 to 20 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable; few fine accumulations of carbonate; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches) thick)

   C--51 to 152 centimeters (20 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; common very fine accumulations of carbonate; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Hughes County, South Dakota; about 9.6 kilometer (6 miles) north and 16 kilometers (10 miles) west of Pierre; 724 meters (2,376 feet) north and 55 meters (180 feet) west of fence from the SE corner of sec. 22, T. 112 N., R. 81 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to free carbonates: less than 13 centimeters (5 inches), except in areas of native grasses soil leached of carbonates to 13 centimeters (5 inches) in some pedons  
Buried A horizons: variable depths in some pedons

A horizon:
Value: 4 or 5, and 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3  
Texture: silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

AC horizon (where present):
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7, and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline
Accumulations of carbonate: few to common  
Bw or Bk horizon in some pedons: base less than 25 centimeters (10 inches) from the surface.

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7, and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam 
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline
Accumulations of carbonate: common or many

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: nearly level terraces and gently sloping to steep uplands.  
Parent material: calcareous, silty loess
Slopes: 0 to 60 percent.  
Mean annual temperatures: 7 to 12 degrees C. (45 to 53 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 61 centimeters (15 to 24 inches)  
Growing season: 130 to 160 days 
Average growing season precipitation: 33 to 46 centimeters (13 to 18 inches)
Growing degree day units: 2700 to 3400

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Agar, Dorna, Dupree, Fairlo, Lowry and Sansarc soils.  
Lowry soils have a mollic epipedon and typically are on smoother, less sloping landscapes above the Sully soils.  
Agar and Fairlo soils have mollic epipedons and an argillic horizon and are on less sloping landscapes usually above the Sully soils.  
Dupree and Sansarc soils have a fine textured control section and are generally on lower landscapes.  
Dorna soils have more than 35 percent clay at depths within 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are on flats and terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low to very high
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:    moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most area are in rangeland.  
A few areas are cropped to corn, sorghum and alfalfa.  
Principal grasses are needleandthread, western wheatgrass, blue grama, little bluestem, sideoats grama, threadleaf sedge, green needlegrass, big bluestem, plains muhly, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas.  It is extensive.
