STINES SERIES

The Stines series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that are formed in alluvium and residuum of volcanic ash.  They are on hillsides and mesa sides and have slopes of 25 to 75 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 360 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stines very stony sandy loam.  On a 65 percent smooth slope, northwest aspect, 1,555 meter elevation.  The profile was moist throughout when described.  This profile was described April 23, 1980.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very stony ashy sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw1--23 to 56 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and medium, few fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.  (23 to 38 cm thick)

    Bw2--56 to 84 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7/6); clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick)

    Bk--84 to 107 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very stony ashy fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; 15 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual smooth boundary.  (18 to 41 cm thick)

    Cr--107 cm; light gray (N 7/) weakly consolidated volcanic ash.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fulcrum and Lonigan series.  Fulcrum soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Lonigan soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stines soils are on mesa sides and hillsides.  Slopes range from 25 to 75 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,525 to 2,200 meters.  The soil formed in alluvium and residuum of weakly consolidated volcanic ash.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 to 460 mm, the average annual air temperature is about 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chen, Coalbank, Cottonthomas, Hardister, and Tomsherry soils.  Coalbank, Cottonthomas, Hardister, and Tomsherry soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Coalbank soils are the lower part of steep north slopes.  Cottonthomas and Tomsherry are on terraces.  Hardister soils are on valley bottoms.  Chen soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and are shallow to bedrock.  They are on mesa tops.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity; medium to very rapid runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Stines soils are used for wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The soils of this series are inextensive in south central Idaho. MLRA 25 and 13.
