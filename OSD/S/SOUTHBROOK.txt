SOUTHBROOK SERIES

The Southbrook series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of alluvium over outwash. These soils are on flats and swales on flood plains and stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Cumulic Vertic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Southbrook silty clay loam, on a slope of 1 percent, in a CRP field, at an elevation about 424 meters above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ap--0 to 25 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak fine granular and weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A1--25 to 69 centimeters; black (2.5Y 2.5/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few very fine roots; common fine prominent dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) iron concentrations; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. 

    A2--69 to 102 centimeters; black (2.5Y 2/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; sheen on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bg--102 to 109 centimeters; very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; about 2 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. 

    2Cg--109 to 203 centimeters; dark gray (5Y 4/1) coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biscay, Dickman Estherville, Mayer, Minneopa, and Shandep soils.
Biscay--are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a mollic epipedon less than 60 centimeters thick
Dickman--are on higher landscape positions and do not have a saturated zone within 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of the years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation

Mayer--are on slightly higher landscape positions and have carbonates within a depth of 25 centimeters
Minneopa--are on higher landscape positions and have a clay content of less than 15 percent in the particle-size control section
Shandep--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Southbrook soils and have a clay content that averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated between the soil surface and a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.10 to 1.00 micrometers per second in the alluvium and 10.00 to 705.00 micrometers per second in the underlying outwash
Flooding--rarely to frequently flooded for brief to long duration
