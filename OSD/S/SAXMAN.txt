SAXMAN SERIES 


The Saxman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on high flood plains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Imano, Willowbrook and Yaggy. The somewhat poorly drained, fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal Imano soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower flood plains. The somewhat poorly drained, sandy Willowbrook soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower flood plains. Willowbrook soils have coarse-loamy textures in the upper 14 to 26 inches (36 to 66 centimeters). The somewhat poorly drained, sandy Yaggy soils are on lower flood plains and are typically finely stratified with loamy textures above 19 inches (48 centimeters). 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is very low. Permeability is rapid. An apparent water table is present with an upper limit of 22 to 36 inches (56 to 91 centimeters) February through May in most years. Flooding is rare, very brief duration.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in cropland. Wheat, grain sorghum and alfalfa are the principal crops. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Reno County, Kansas, 1999 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 13 inches (0 to 34 centimeters) (Ap1, Ap2, A)
Water table: The presence of an apparent water table from 2.0 to 3.0 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) during the months of Feb. - Jun.
Keys to Soil Taxonomy: Eighth edition, 1998

ADDITIONAL DATA: These soils were formerly mapped as the Canadian series. They differ by having sandy textures and a seasonal high water table. 

Characterization data is available on this pedon (90KS155004; NSSL lab pedon # 90P923). Supporting pedons:

The Saxman series has been revised since the first time it was sent up.  We are using the 1990 characterization pedon as the TP (90KS155004).  This revision involved so many changes from the original OSD that we are sending up a whole new file (ie no  marks). JCW RMM
