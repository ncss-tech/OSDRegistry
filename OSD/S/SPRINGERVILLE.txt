SPRINGERVILLE SERIES

The Springerville series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from tuff, volcanic breccia and basalt.  Springerville soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Springerville stony silty clay - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 4/2) stony silty clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 25 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) stony silty clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 25 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

(5 to 10 inches thick)

    Ass2--9 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) silty clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine angular blocky and subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine roots; common fine tubular and irregular pores; common medium slickensides; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Rock Fragments:  5 to 40 percent gravel, cobble and stones

Soil Temperature: 47 to 59 degrees F.

Organic matter:  More than 1 percent in the surface

Cracking: Deep, wide cracks are open more than 210 days cumulative

Reaction:  Slightly or moderately alkaline

Depth to bedrock:  40 to 60 inches

A and Ass horizons
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  3, 4 or 5 dry, 2, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2, 3 or 4, dry or moist

Css, Bss and Bk horizons
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  3, 4 or 5 dry, 2, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 6, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Albers (AZ), Antelopeflat (CO), Arboles (C), Dominquez (CO), Ritoazul (CO), and Sideshow (CO) series. Albers soils are very deep. Antelopeflat have accumulations of gypsum in the profile. Arboles soils formed in parent material derived from shale. Dominquez soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. Ritoazul soils are moderately deep to shale and have accumulations of gypsum in the profile. Sideshow soils are effervescent at 10 inches, contain less than 5 percent calcium carbonates equivalents and do not have 5YR hue. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Springerville soils are on plateaus and mesas and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from tuff, volcanic breccia and basalt.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cabezon, Showlow, Tajo and Thunderbird soils.  These soils do not have intersecting slickensides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Springerville soils are used for livestock grazing, fuelwood production and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is blue grama, sideoats grama, snakeweed, juniper and pinon pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  This series is extensive. MLRAs 35 & 39.
