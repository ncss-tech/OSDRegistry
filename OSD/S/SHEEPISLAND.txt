SHEEPISLAND SERIES

The Sheepisland series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in mossy organic parent material over silty marine deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 615 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic Terric Cryofibrists

TYPICAL PEDON: Sheepisland peat, located on a coastal plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 8 meters; when described on July 27th, 2007 the soil was saturated throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi1--0 to 54 cm; peat; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and common coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary

 Oi2--54 to 110 cm; peat; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and common coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary

 Cg--110 to 183 cm; 85 percent dark greenish gray (10Y 3/1) silt; 13 percent sand; 80 percent silt; 7 percent clay; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; 15 percent medium very dark gray (N 3/) moist, masses of reduced iron with clear boundaries; slightly acid (pH 6.1)
