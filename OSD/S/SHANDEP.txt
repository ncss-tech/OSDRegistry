SHANDEP SERIES

The Shandep series consists of very poorly and poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loamy alluvial sediments over sandy and gravelly outwash. These soils are in depressions or flats on stream terraces, flood plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Franklin County, Iowa, l977.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; 
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 74 centimeters (A1, A2, and A3 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 74 centimeters to 114 centimeters (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

This soil has been previously identified as Marshan, depressional phase.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
