TYPE LOCATION: Grays Harbor County, Washington, about 4.5 km southwest of Rochester and about 260 m south of Independence Road SW; about 710 m west and 795 m north of the southeast corner of section 11, T.15 N., R.4 W., Willamette Meridian; Oakville, Washington, U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle; latitude 46.8003990 degrees north, longitude 123.1489810 degrees west, WGS 84 (coordinates determined with a GPS)

COMPETING SERIES:
Cape--mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 15 degrees C; pH of 3.5 to 5.5; no redoximorphic features or aquic conditions within 15 cm of the soil surface

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Elevation--5 to 150 m
Mean annual precipitation--1000 to 1800 mm
Mean annual air temperature--10 to 11 degrees C
Frost-free period--150 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Rennie--18 to 35 percent clay (weighted average) in particle-size control section; pH of 5.0 or more in control section; on similar landforms
Chehalis, Eld--no aquic conditions; on flood plains
Maytown--no aquic conditions within 50 cm of the soil surface; in concave to linear positions of flood plains

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--very poorly drained
Depth to apparent seasonal water table--at the surface to a depth of 30 cm at times in October through May, at the surface to a depth of more than 100 cm in June through September
Flooding--frequent, brief to long periods in November through April
Ponding--frequent, long or very long periods in October through June
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat)--low to moderately high in A horizon, very low to moderately low in Bg and Cg horizons

Ponding and the seasonal high water table in some pedons may be altered by artificial drainage.
Flooding in some pedons may be altered by flood protection structures.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Use--wildlife habitat, livestock grazing, hay and crop production in cleared and/or artificially drained or protected areas
Native vegetation--Douglas spirea, redosier dogwood, willow, skunk cabbage, slough sedge, and bulrush; some areas have an overstory of red alder and Oregon ash

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Washington; MLRA 2; moderate extent

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Grays Harbor County (Grays Harbor County Area), Washington; 1970

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--zone from the surface to a depth of 75 cm
*Aquic conditions--zone from the surface to a depth of 150 cm
*Endosaturation--zone from the surface to a depth of 150 cm
*Reduced matrix--zone from 15 to 150 cm

04/1994--Previously classified as fine, montmorillonitic, acid, mesic Vertic Haplaquepts; classification change based on amendments to Soil Taxonomy.

11/2016--Based on update field investigations, the type location was moved and the series concept was limited to MLRA 2 soils with endosaturation. The official series description was edited according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation to recorrelate Salzer soils mapped in the flood plains of MLRAs 1 and 4a is recommended.
