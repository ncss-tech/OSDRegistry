SCHAEFERVILLE SERIES

The Schaeferville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived primarily from red silty shale.  Schaeferville soils are on lower backslopes and footslopes of escarpments and foothills and mountains.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Schaeferville silt loam, on a southwest facing, concave slope of 33 percent in woodland at an elevation of 1,210 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on May 14, 2008 the soil was moist throughout.

    Oi--0 to 1 cm; slightly decomposed pine needles and shrubby and herbaceous plant residue (0 to 2 cm thick)

    A--3 to 6 cm; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots throughout; 12 percent very strongly cemented, fine and medium angular limestone gravel; very slight effervescence; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

    Bw--6 to 35 cm; red (2.5YR 5/6) silt loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots throughout; about 10 percent weakly to moderately cemented, fine and medium, angular and subangular shale parachanners; very few (less than 1 percent) fine prominent pinkish white (5YR 8/2) calcium carbonate masses and threads; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (14 to 32 cm thick)

    Ck1--35 to 51 cm; red (2.5YR 5/6) parachannery silt loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive parting to fine and medium block-like shale rock structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; about 30 percent weakly to moderately cemented, fine and medium, angular and subangular shale parachanners; common (about 7 percent) medium prominent pinkish white (5YR 8/2) calcium carbonate masses and threads; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--51 to 72 cm; light red (2.5YR 6/6) extremely paragravelly silt loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive parting to coarse and medium, block-like shale rock structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; about 70 percent weakly to moderately cemented, fine and medium, angular and subangular shale parachanners; slight effervescence, calcium carbonate mostly disseminated; moderately alkaline; gradual irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 16 to 48 cm)

    Cr--72 to 200 cm; red (2.5YR 5/6) and light red (2.5YR 6/6) weakly fragmented, slight effervescence; silty shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Meade County, South Dakota; about 1.5 miles west and 0.5 miles north of Blackhawk; located about 2,470 feet south and 2,520 feet east of the northwest corner of Sec. 1, T. 2 N., R. 6 E.; Blackhawk USGS quadrangle; 44 degrees 9 minutes 45.1 seconds N. latitude and 103 degrees 20 minutes 33.8 seconds W. longitude; NAD 83

Chroma:  3 to 6
Texture:  soft silty shale bedrock, typically slightly weathered and fractured in the upper 30 to 90 cm; less weathering evident with increasing depth

COMPETING SERIES:  
Cherry - Cherry soils are very deep, have hues of 2.5Y or 5Y throughout, and formed in alluvium from Tertiary-aged sedimentary beds

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from red silty shale (Opeche Formation)
Landform:  lower backslopes and footslopes of escarpments and on rolling hillslopes in foothills and mountains 
Slopes:  6 to 60 percent
Elevation:  1,128 to 1,524 meters
Mean annual air temperature:  6 to 8.5 degrees C 
Mean annual precipitation:  455 to 610 mm
Precipitation pattern:  In most years, half or more of the normal precipitation falls as rain and/or snow from April through 
mid-July 
Frost-free period:  100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Citivar(T) - have a fine-textured particle-size control section; they generally occur on backslopes and footslopes below 
Schaeferville soils
Opechekahta(T) - are fine-loamy and deep or very deep to siltstone; they occur on backslopes above Schaeferville soils
Rockerville(T) - are shallow to hard limestone; they occur on ridge crests above Schaeferville soils

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately low to moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity

USE AND VEGETATION: Schaeferville soils are typically wooded and utilized for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation consists of an overstory of ponderosa pine and bur oak; understory species include ground juniper, eastern hophornbean, western wheatgrass, Richardson needlegrass, and bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Low Limestone Plateau physiographic area of the Black Hills of South Dakota; LRR G, MLRA 62; the series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES PROPOSED: Proposed during the Update Soil Survey of Meade County, South Dakota, MLRA 62 Part.  The name is taken from Schaeferville, an unincorporated village in the geographic area.  

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 72 cm (Bw, Ck1, and C2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 3 to 6 cm (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 35 cm (Bw horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with red silty shale at 72 cm (Cr horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Schaeferville soils were not recognized in initial versions of this or other soil survey subsets of MLRA 62.
