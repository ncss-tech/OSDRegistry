SECREPASS SERIES

The Secrepass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Secrepass soils are on fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Palexerolls

     2Bt2--58 to 79 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) very gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; strong coarse prismatic parting to strong coarse angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine to coarse roots; many very fine, few fine, medium and coarse tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; few pressure faces; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 28 cm thick)

     3C--79 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amboat, Aninto, Durfee, Ebic, and Ziram. 

Amboat soils have 60 to 85 percent stones in the Bt horizons and have a combined A and Bt thickness of 100 to more than 150 cm. Aninto soils have a combined A and Bt horizon thickness of more than 100 cm and have a 2Bk horizon. Durfee soils have a combined A and Bt horizon thickness of more than 150 cm, and clay content that does not decrease by as much as 20 percent of the maximum within 150 cm. Ebic soils are 50 to 75 cm to bedrock. Ziram soils have 18 to 28 cm thick mollic epipedons and are 40 to 70 cm to secondary carbonates,

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Secrepass soils are on fan piedmont remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,895 to 2,135 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bullump, Cleavage, Krenka and Welch series. 

Bullump and Krenka soils have mollic epipedons greater than 50 cm thick. Cleavage soils are shallow to bedrock. Welch soils are very poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, Letterman needlegrass, Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Nevada. MLRA 25. These soils are not extensive.
