SENRA SERIES

The Senra series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt or tuff-breccia. Senra soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid, shallow Vitritorrandic Durixerolls

   Bqm2--66 to 81 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) cemented material, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; strong thick platy structure; very rigid; indurated by secondary silica; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 28 cm thick) 

    R--81 cm; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Goodtack series. Goodtack soils have 18 to 26 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Senra soils are on lava plateaus. These soils formed in volcanic ash and residuum derived from basalt or tuff-breccia. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,540 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Goodtack soil and the Borobey, Dunres, Hayespring, Jacksplace, and Moonbeam soils. Borobey soils are very deep and do not have argillic horizons or duripans. Dunres and Moonbeam soils are clayey. Hayespring soils are moderately deep to duripans. Jacksplace soils are ashy-skeletal and moderately deep to lithic contacts. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Senra soils are used for livestock grazing. The vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, and scattered western juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
