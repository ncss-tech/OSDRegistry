SUCCESSLOOP SERIES

The Successloop series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite with a minor influence from limestone and dolomite. Successloop soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Successloop very gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles. 

    A1--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial and tubular pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  

    A2--15 to 35 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 25 to 38 cm) 

    Bt--35 to 69 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine and few medium interstitial and tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (30 to 100 cm thick)

    C--69 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

Cowlow soils have a calcic horizon at 28 to 76 cm.
Crandall soils are deep.
Ezbin soils have Oi and Oe horizons.
Forsey soils have a mean summer soil temperature of 13.9 to 15 degrees C.
Fourme soils have a mean summer soil temperature of 10 to 13.3 degrees C.
Itwo soils are moderately deep. 
Jackflat soils have a paralithic contact at 100 to 150 cm.
Packer soils are less than 53 cm deep to the base of the argillic horizon.

Zeebar soils have a mean summer soil temperature of 10 to 15 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Successloop soils are on mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite with minor influence from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 2,950 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brokit, Kolcheck, and Cooperwash soils. Brokit soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size control section with 12 to 20 percent clay in the upper part and 3 to 10 percent clay in the lower part.Kolcheck soils are somewhat poorly drained and have 2 to 20 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.Cooperwash soils have 40 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Successloop soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, Letterman's needlegrass and mountain big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
