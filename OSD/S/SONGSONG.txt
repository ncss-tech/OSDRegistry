SONGSONG SERIES

The Songsong Series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic alluvium.  The Songsong soils are on dissected alluvial fans and terraces and steep remnant terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 100 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 25 degrees C. (77 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over ashy-pumiceous or ashy-skeletal, glassy, isohyperthermic Typic Ustivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Songsong loam, on a south facing, 10 percent slope in a jungle of tangantangan, hibiscus and coconut trees at an elevation of 9 meters (30 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on June 12, 1999 the soil was moist throughout).

    A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); black (2.5Y 2.5/1) interior, ashy loam; weak fine subangular blocky and weak medium subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderately smeary; many very fine, many fine, common medium, and common coarse roots throughout; 10 percent angular 2 to 75mm cinders; slightly acid, pH 6.3; gradual wavy boundary. 8 to 28 centimeters thick (3 to 11 inches).

    Bw1--15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in); olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) interior, very gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand; weak fine subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots throughout and common very fine roots throughout; 50 percent angular 2 to 75mm cinders; neutral, pH 7.3; clear wavy boundary; 5 to 25 centimeters thick (2 to 10 inches).

    Bw2--30 to 48 cm (12 to 19 in); olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) interior, very gravelly ashy coarse sand; weak fine subangular blocky and weak medium subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and common medium roots throughout; 10 percent subangular 2 to 20 mm strongly cemented tuff fragments; 45 percent angular 2 to 75 mm cinder fragments; slightly alkaline, pH 7.4; clear smooth boundary; there is a laminar cemented layer within this layer angled at 40 degrees; 8 to 67 centimeters thick (3 to 27 inches).

    2C--48 to 66 cm (19 to 26 in); 20 percent lithochromic dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) interior and 80 percent lithochromic dark gray (10YR 4/1) interior, stratified very gravelly ashy coarse sand; massive; firm, hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; 35 percent subrounded 2 to 75 mm cinders; neutral, pH 7.3; gradual wavy boundary; 15 to 30 centimeters thick (6 to 12 inches). 

    3C--66 to 203 cm (26 to 80 in); 20 percent lithochromic dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) interior and 80 percent lithochromic dark gray (10YR 4/1) interior, stratified very gravelly ashy coarse sand;  structure; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; 45 percent subrounded 2 to 75 mm cinders; neutral, pH 7.2; 48 to 137 centimeters thick (19 to 54 inches).

TYPE LOCATION: Island of Agrihan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, approximately 457 meters (1500 feet) northeast of the well, Songsong Village; lat. 18 degrees, 44 minutes and 19 seconds north; long. 145 degrees, 39 minutes, and 39 seconds east; NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: volcanic ash and cinders derived from basalt and andesite deposited through alluvial and colluvial processes
Landform: dissected alluvial terraces and steep remnant terraces
Slopes: 0 to 100 percent
Elevation: 6 to 304 meters (20 to 1000 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 26 to 30 degrees C. (79 to 86 degrees F.)
The mean annual soil temperature:  about 28 degrees C. (83 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 1780 to 2290 millimeters (70 to 90 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Tropical, characterized by a wet season from July through November when moderate or torrential rains occur, and a dry season when substantially less precipitation from December through June is received.
Frost-free period:  365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Apilam and the Hatisu soils.  Both Apilam and Haitisu soils have finer textures in the solum and Apilam soils have seasonal densic layers.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to medium runoff, and moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for agroforestry, mixed agriculture, and beef, goat and hog grazing.  Native and naturalized vegetation includes short grasses, coconut palms, hibiscus, breadfruit, giant tangantangan, and fish-kill tree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Mariana Islands.  The series is of small extent.
