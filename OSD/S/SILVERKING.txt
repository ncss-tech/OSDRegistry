SILVERKING SERIES

The Silverking series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that have extremely gravelly sand at depths of 20 to 40 inches. These soils formed in alluvium and are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Silverking silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; forest litter of slightly decomposed needles, twigs, and roots.

    A--1 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many light gray silt and sand skeletons on faces of peds; common worm casts; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 25 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common fine and medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations; weak medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common worm casts and krotovinas in upper part; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (17 to 35 inches thick)

    2C--25 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 60 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

Reaction: pH 7.4 to 8.4

COMPETING SERIES: 

Dillon (MT) - has hues of 2.5Y or yellower in the 2C horizon; has a BC horizon; has a 10 to 14 inches precipitation zone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - flood plains.
Elevation - 4,400 to 5,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 3 percent.
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 19 to 24 inches, most of which falls as winter snow, and spring rain.
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability in the upper part of the soil profile and very rapid at depths below 20 to 40 inches.

USE AND VEGETATION: Silverking soils are used mainly for woodland and understory grazing. Potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, spruce, and Douglas fir with and understory of common snowberry, Oregon-grape, bearded wheatgrass, blue wildrye, western meadowrue, horsetail, woods rose, russet buffaloberry, common juniper, other forbs, shrubs, and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Silverking soils are inextensive in the mountain valleys of western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lewis and Clark County Area, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1988. 

REMARKS: Soil Interpretations Record: MT1226. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A, part of Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 24 inches (Bw horizon); and a sandy-skeletal 2C horizon below a depth of 24 inches. Silverking soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aquic.
