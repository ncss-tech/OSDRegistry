SAMALA SERIES

The Samala series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sources. Samala soils are on cuesta dip slopes, fan remnants, and structural benches. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 279 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Samala gravelly sandy loam, 3 percent slope at an elevation of 1,972 meters. The surface is covered by 35 percent gravel and 3 percent cobbles. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

        A--0 to 12 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

        Btk1--12 to 31 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; 5 percent faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent calcium carbonate masses in the matrix and 20 percent carbonate coats on rock fragments; 25 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. 

        Btk2--31 to 53 cm; pink (7.5YR 8/3) very gravelly sandy loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; 5 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent calcium carbonate masses in the matrix and 25 percent carbonate coats on rock fragments; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

        Btk3--53 to 81 cm; pink (7.5YR 8/3) very gravelly sandy loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; 5 percent faint clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Btk horizons is 30 to 100 cm)

        Bk--81 to 152 cm; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) very cobbly sandy loam, pink (7.5YR 7/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; 35 percent calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; 25 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
