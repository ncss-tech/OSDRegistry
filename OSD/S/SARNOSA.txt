SARNOSA SERIES

The Sarnosa series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in loamy residuum from calcareous sandstone mainly of the Oakville sandstone and sandstone members of the Goliad Formation. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.4 degrees C (70.5 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sarnosa fine sandy loam, on southeast-facing, convex, 3 percent slope in rangeland; elevation is 106.7 m (350 ft).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland.  Some areas with nearly level to gently sloping areas are cultivated to grain sorghum and cotton.  Native vegetation is mainly little bluestem, sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, curlymesquite, and silver bluestem.  Woody species are mesquite, huisache, and pricklypear. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and Central Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I; MLRA 83A, 83C; extensive.
