SQUATTERFLAT SERIES

The Squatterflat series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on eroded mountain valley terraces. Squatterflat soils formed in colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and tuff breccia over alluvium derived from mixed sources with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and mean annual temperature about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Squatterflat very cobbly ashy silt loam - forested, on an 18 percent northwestfacing slope at 3,750 feet elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Textures are apparent field textures.)
