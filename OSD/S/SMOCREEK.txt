SMOCREEK SERIES

The Smocreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The Smocreek soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually moist, but are continuously dry in all parts between the depth of 10 and 38 cm for 80 to 90 days in August through October. The soils are saturated from 100 to 150 cm from January through May.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C.    
Mollic epipedon: 30 to 50 cm thick.

Carbonates: Slightly effervescent through strongly effervescent with disseminated lime in the upper part and lime segregated as filaments, threads or seams in the lower part.  
Other features: One or more buried A horizons occur within the profile, organic matter decreases irregularly with depth and ranges from 2 to 4 percent. Few to common distinct to prominent 10YR 5/8, 6/3, 6/4 or 6/6 redox features occur from 5 to 150 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Maytown series.  Maytown soils lack Bk horizons with secondary lime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Smocreek soils are on stream terraces.   They formed in alluvium from basalt, andesite and tuff. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,230 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is semi-arid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 400 mm.  Snowfall ranges from 250 to 760 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free season is 60 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Corral, Brubeck, Horsecamp, Gerlach, Ravendale, and Saddlerock soils. Corral soils are less than 50 cm to a paralithic contact and have aridic moisture regimes.  Brubeck, Horsecamp, Gerlach and Ravendale soils lack mollic epipedons, are in the fine family and have cracks that open and close each year.  Saddlerock soils are in the fine family and have an aquic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity. The alkali phase has slow permeability.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 100 to 150 cm, and the soils are subject to rare flooding for very brief or brief periods from January through May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Smocreek soils are used mostly for rangeland and to a minor extent are used for irrigated and pasture.  Vegetation is basin wildrye, basin big sagebrush, beardless wildrye and mountain brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  The soils of this series are not extensive.
