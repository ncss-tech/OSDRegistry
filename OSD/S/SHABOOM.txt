SHABOOM SERIES 

The Shaboom series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium or colluvium from coarse grained igneous bedrock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shaboom gravelly coarse sandy loam, very bouldery in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--1 to 0 inches; forest litter of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. 

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine, and few medium roots; many fine and very fine pores; 5 percent cobbles, 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.1); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--3 to 12 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 15 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8). (9 to 16 inches thick) 

    R--12 inches; hard granite bedrock.

Cypher (NM) - has C horizons; has less than 45 percent medium and coarser sand in the particle-size control section. 

Devilfence (MT) - has horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.

Deville (MT) - does not have an O horizon; formed in residuum from hard shale.

Kounter (MT) - has horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation; has a paralithic contact above the lithic contact.

Roegulch (MT) - has a paralithic contact over the lithic contact; has moderate permeability. 

Quaint (MT) - has horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation; is mildly or moderately alkaline below the surface horizon; has hues of 7.5YR and redder. 

Sharrott (MT) - has 10 to 15 percent clay and less than 45 percent medium and coarser sands; they formed in residuum and colluvium from argillite or quartzite. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of hills. 

Elevation - 4,400 to 6,000 feet. 

Slope - 4 to 70 percent. 

Parent material - residuum, slope alluvium or colluvium from coarse grained granitic bedrock. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches. 

Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 42 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 70 to 105 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Shaboom soils are mainly used as woodland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, pinegrass, common snowberry, kinnikinnick, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, forbs, and low shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Shaboom soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1534, MT3017.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 3 to 12 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (A, Bw horizons); a lithic contact at 12 inches (R horizon).  Shaboom soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
