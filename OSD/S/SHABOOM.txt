SHABOOM SERIES

The Shaboom series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium or colluvium from coarse grained igneous bedrock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shaboom gravelly coarse sandy loam, very bouldery in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; forest litter of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. 

    A--3 to 11 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine, and few medium roots; many fine and very fine pores; 5 percent cobbles, 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.1); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 10 cm thick) 

    Bw--11 to 34 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 15 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8). 

    R--34 cm; hard granite bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Shaboom soils are mainly used as woodland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, pinegrass, common snowberry, kinnikinnick, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, forbs, and low shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Shaboom soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana and southwestern Wyoming; MLRA 43B
