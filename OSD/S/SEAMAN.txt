SEAMAN SERIES

The Seaman series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with a component of volcanic ash or pyroclastic materials.  The Seaman soils are on fan skirts, and on inset fans and fan aprons of the fan piedmont.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Seaman sandy loam.  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; many glass shards, particularly on the soil surface; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 cm thick).

    C1--10 to 36 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; contains many glass shards; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 33 cm thick).

    C2--36 to 61 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; many glass shards; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick).

    C3--61 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) heavy fine sandy loam stratified with thin lenses of gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many interstitial pores of various sizes; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; approximately 2 miles south of Ash Springs and 200 feet west of U.S. Highway 93, about 1,840 feet west and 1,170 feet north of the southeast corner of section 18, T. 5 S., R. 6l E.; USGS Ash Springs 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 25 minutes 25 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 10 minutes 49 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.4236111latitude, -115.1802778longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter, early spring and for a few brief intermittent periods following summer convection storms. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil Temperature: 15 to 17.8 degrees C.
Profile reaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.
Other features: Some pedons have bedrock or cemented substrata at depths below 40 inches.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Average 10 to 18 percent
Rock fragments - Up to 15 percent by average; up to 40 percent in any one stratum.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Cl and C2 horizons
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Dominantly coarse sandy loam through fine sandy loam.  Minor strata of loamy sand or loamy fine sand occurs in some pedons.
Rock fragments:  Commonly less than l5 percent, but some sub- horizons of some pedons contain up to 40 percent.

C3 and C4 horizons
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Commonly coarse sandy loam through fine sandy loam.  Minor strata of coarser or finer textures occur in some pedons within a depth of 100 cm.
Rock fragments:  Commonly less than l5 percent.
Segregated carbonates:  Up to 5 percent by volume of visible secondary carbonate occurs in some pedons below a depth 50 cm as coatings on rock fragments or as seams or filament.
Other features:  Below a depth of 100 cm, some pedons have sandy or sandy-skeletal substrata.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bitterwater, Cobat, Colhill, Elkhills, and Kimberlina series.  Bitterwater soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 18.3 to 20.8 degrees C., and are not appreciably moistened by summer precipitation.  Cobat soils have control sections with fine-loamy lacustrine strata in the lower part.  Colhill soils average l5 to 30 percent rock fragments in the textural control section.  Elkhills soils are not appreciably moistened by summer precipitation.  Kimberlina soils have noneffervescent A horizons and are not appreciably moistened by summer precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Seaman soils are on fan skirts and on inset fans and fan aprons of the fan piedmont.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium with a component of volcanic ash or pyroclastic materials.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 3,000 to 3,500 feet.  The climate is warm, with hot dry summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 170 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Maynard Lake, and Penoyer soils.  Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal textural control sections.  Maynard Lake soils have sandy textural control sections.  Penoyer soils have coarse-silty textural control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  In areas where drainage has been altered by irrigation, depth to a seasonal water table is 90 to 152 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated agriculture, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage, fourwing saltbush, big saltbush, shadscale, white burrobrush, and big galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 30.
