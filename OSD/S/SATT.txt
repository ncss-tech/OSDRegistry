SATT SERIES

The Satt series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Satt soils are on eroded fan remnants with slopes ranging from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 325 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Dacore soils have a calcic horizon at 20 to 48 cm and an aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime. Derapter soils have a litic contact with basalt at 100 to 152 cm. Grube soils form in quartzite parent materials and have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Majuba soils form in metamorphic parent materials and have a lithic contact at 64 to 100 cm. Swisbob soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Satt soils are on summits, shoulders and upper backslopes of eroded fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,900 to 2,100 meters. The climate is dry, sub-humid with cool moist winters and hot dry summers with the exception of 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Decathon and Swisbob series.  Decathon soils are shallow to a duripan and in a mesic temperature regime. Swisbob soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Satt soils are used for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing. Potential native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, and minor amounts of pinyon pine and Utah juniper. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY088NV, Gravelly Clay 12-14 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28A.
