STONEHEAD SERIES

The Stonehead series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum weathered from soft shale or soft siltstone bedrock. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashburn, Blocher, Deuchars, Gallipolis, Jeneva, Percell, Tarhollow and Westgate series.  All these series, except Deuchars,  Tarhollow and Westgate do not have a paralithic contact in the series control section. Deuchars soils average more than 14 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Tarhollow soils dominantly have siltstone channers and not pararock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and have a total amount of fragments less than 20 percent in the 2BC horizons. Westgate soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Stonehead soils are on hills underlain with shale or siltstone. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Stonehead soils formed in 64 to 102 cm (25 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from soft shale or soft siltstone bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches), and mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 104 to 305 meters (340 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coolville, Deam, Gnawbone, Kurtz, Rarden, Trevlac and Wellrock soils. The moderately well drained, deep Coolville and moderately deep Rarden soils are generally on shoulders and backslopes of hills. The well drained, moderately deep Deam and Gnawbone soils are on shoulders and backslopes of hills. The well drained, deep Kurtz soils are on backslopes of hills. The well drained, moderately deep Trevlac soils are on shoulders and backslopes of hills.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) in the upper part of the solum and moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers/sec) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. Depth to an intermittent perched seasonal high water table is a 61 to 91 centimeters (2.0 to 3.0 feet) in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for hay, pasture or are in woodland. A few areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. Native vegetation consists of mixed hardwoods with oaks, hickory, beech, maple, and tulip poplar the major species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Indiana. This soil is of moderate extent in the east part of MLRA 120C.
