SCALLEY SERIES

The Scalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till over sandy drift on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, mesic Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Scalley fine sandy loam, on a 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 cm (6 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; about 3 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 E/B--15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam (E); occupying about 75 percent of the horizon as tongues extending into or completely surrounding isolated remnants of reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam (Bt); moderate medium subangular structure; firm; few distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 3 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 36 cm (14 inches) thick]

 B/E--46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam (Bt); few distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; occupying about 60 percent of the horizon completely surround by or penetrated by tongues of brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam (E); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; about 3 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 30 cm (2 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bt--56 to 86 cm (22 to 34 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films of faces of peds; about 2 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 inches) thick]

 2C--86 to 203 cm (34 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; few bands of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam that range from 3 mm to 5 cm (1/8 to 2 inches) thick; massive; very friable; about 3 percent fine gravel; slightly acid.

2C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 6
Texture: sand, fine sand, or loamy sand, or the gravelly analogues of these textures, or is stratified sand and loamy sand; some pedons do not have thin strata of sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 35 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scalley soils are on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. They formed in loamy till over sandy drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature range from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained Marlette soils and the well drained Oshtemo and Spinks soils. Oshtemo and Spinks soils are sandier in the upper part of the solum. All three soils are in similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential surface runoff is negligible to high depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy till and high or very high in the sandy drift. Permeability is moderately slow in the loamy horizons and rapid to very rapid in the underlying sandy substrata.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have been cleared and used for cropland or fruit production. Corn, small gain, hay, soybeans, and field beans are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 97, and 98 in central Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
