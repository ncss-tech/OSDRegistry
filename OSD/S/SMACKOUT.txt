SMACKOUT SERIES

The Smackout series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till mainly from shaly rock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Smackout soils are on glaciated uplands and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 685 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Andic Haploxerepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Smackout ashy loam, woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    0i & 0e--0 to 3 cm; decomposed mat of needles, leaves, twigs, bark, and cones; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A--3 to 20 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) ashy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; many fine and medium, and few coarse roots; many fine pores; 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw1--20 to 33 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) ashy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; many fine and medium, and few coarse roots; many fine pores; 8 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    2Bw2--33 to 65 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common fine pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 38 cm cm thick)

    2Bw3--65 to 88 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common fine pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    2Bw4--88 to 123 cm; gray (5Y 5/1) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 38 cm thick)

    2C--123 to 150 cm; gray (5Y 5/1) gravelly loam, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4). 

TYPE LOCATION: Stevens County, Washington; about 1 mile southwest of Cedar Lake; 1,500 feet north and 1,000 feet east of the SW corner of section 34, T.40N., R.41E., WM. Latitude - 48 degrees, 55 minutes, 38.67 seconds North; Longitude - 117 degrees, 36 minutes, 31.67 seconds West; WGS84; USGS Leadpoint WA, Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist in all horizons during part of the year but is dry in all parts between 10 and 30 cm for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mantle of volcanic ash and loess is 18 to 33 cm thick. The mean annual soil temperature is about 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C. The control section averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments. The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline. 

A and Bw horizons:
Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR
Value - 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 3 or 4, dry or moist
Clay content - 7 to 10 percent
Rock fragment content - 1 to 10 percent gravel

2Bw and 2C horizons:
Hue - 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y
Value - 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma - 1 or 2, dry or moist 
Textures - loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam
Clay content - 20 to 30 percent
Rock fragment content - 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles

COMPETING SERIES: 
Ahren - are calcareous below a depth of 25 to 33 cm

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - glaciated uplands 
Elevations - 575 to 1395 m
Slopes - 0 to 65 percent
Parent material - glacial till from dark colored shaly rock and limestone with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess
Climate - characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters
Mean annual precipitation - 560 to 990 mm
Average January temperature - minus 5.5 degrees C.
Average July temperature - 18.3 degrees C.
Mean annual temperature - 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C. 
Frost free season - 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aits, Belzar, Huckleberry, Leadpoint, Waits, and the competing Ahren soils. Aits and Waits soils are coarse, loamy. Belzar, Huckleberry, and Leadpoint soils are 50 to 100 cm to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for woodland, grazed woodland and some areas are used for dryland cropland. Native vegetation is Douglas fir, western larch, grand fir, lodgepole pine, western red cedar, western hemlock, paper birch, quaking aspen, Oregon grape, redstem ceanothus, willow, Rocky mountain maple, strawberry, thimbleberry, kinnikinnick, wildrose, brachenfern, spirea, pipsissewa, longtube twinflower, and pinegrass.
