ADDITIONAL DATA: 
NASIS SITE ID--1943OR035001; NASIS PEDON ID--1943OR035001

Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) data are available from a pedon near this type location; Lab Pedon no. 16N0297; User Site and Pedon ID S2015OR035021; these lab data confirm that Vitritorrandic subgroup criteria are met.

04/2022--updated formatting; updated the soil textures with an ashy modifier based on laboratory data from KSSL pedon # 16N0297; changed 18-43 cm horizon from a C to a Bw and added a cambic horizon to the diagnostic features; pedon meets vitritorrandic subgroup criteria.
