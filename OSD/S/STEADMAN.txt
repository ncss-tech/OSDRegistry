 Ap2--15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Ap horizons ranges from 7 to 30 cm (3 to 12 inches)).

 Bw1--30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots; many fine and common medium tubular pores; continuous light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt coatings on faces of peds and in pores; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

 Bw2--61 to 99 cm (24 to 39 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) silt loam; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; many fine and common medium tubular pores; few fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; continuous light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt coatings on faces of peds and in pores; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. 

 Bw3--99 to 132 cm (39 to 52 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) silty clay loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; many fine and common medium tubular pores; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; continuous light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt coats on faces of peds and in pores; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons ranges from 63 to 140 cm (25 to 55 inches)).

 C1--132 to 163 cm (52 to 64 inches); mottled, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 4/3), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; continuous light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt coats on faces of peds and in pores; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

 C2--163 to 191 cm (64 to 75 inches); mottled, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 4/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam; massive; friable, slightly acid.
