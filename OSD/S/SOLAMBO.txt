SOLAMBO SERIES

The Solambo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from slate. The Solambo soils are on foothills and slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters (24 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Solambo loam on a west-facing slope of 15 percent, under cover of blue oak and foothill pine at an elevation of 269 meters. When described on September 19, 2007 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soils and pH is by Hellige-Truog unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Airship, Brockgulch, Chalone and Modjeska soils. Airship and Modjeska soils are very deep and formed in alluvium. Brockgulch soils contain exclusively nonflat fragments from metavolcanic rocks and occur on mountains. Chalone soils contain exclusively nonflat fragments from volcanic breccia and  sand, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam textures in the Bw horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Solambo soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from slate. Elevation is 200 to 350 meters (656 to 1148 feet). The mean annual precipitation is 533 to 711 millimeters (21 to 28 inches). Mean annual air temperature is 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 65 degrees F). Frost-free season ranges from 210 to 235 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Copperopolis, Donpedro and Whiterock soils. Copperopolis soils are loamy-skeletal, are shallow to lithic contact and are on backslopes, footslopes, shoulders, and summits of hillslopes. Donpedro soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to a lithic contact and occur on backslopes and footslopes of hillslopes. Whiterock soils are loamy, are shallow to lithic contact and are on summits and shoulders of hillslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity above the lithic contact is moderate. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for livestock grazing, recreation, and homesite development. Vegetation consists of blue oak, foothill pine, soft chess, annual ryegrass, ripgut brome, wild oat and forbs. On droughty south-facing slopes the vegetation may also include chamise and deerbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills, MLRA 18. The series is moderately extensive.
