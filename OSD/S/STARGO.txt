STARGO SERIES

The Stargo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Stargo soils are on fan skirts, offshore bars, lake plains, alluvial flats and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Duric Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stargo coarse sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stargo soils are on fan skirts, offshore bars, lake plains and alluvial flats. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,394 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is warm, arid with a mean annual precipitation of 125 to 200 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C.  The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Domez, Timper, and Yomba soils.  Domez soils are fine-loamy.  Timper soils are coarse-loamy.  Yomba soils are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation consists mainly of shadscale, Bailey greasewood, Anderson wolfberry, kochia, and Indian ricegrass with some bud sagebrush and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 29.
