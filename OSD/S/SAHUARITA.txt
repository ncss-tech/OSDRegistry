SAHUARITA SERIES

The Sahuarita series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in alluvium from limestone, schist, phyllite and granitic rock.  Sahuarita soils are on fan terraces and basin floors have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Sahuarita very gravelly fine sandy loam-rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak moderately thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary (1 to 10 inches thick).

    Bk--3 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent as few faint calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual smooth boundary (10 to 30 inches thick).

    C--19 to 28 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary (9 to 15 inches thick).

    2Btkb--28 to 45 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films coating sand grains and lining pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent as few faint calcium carbonate filaments on faces of peds; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary (10 to 25 inches thick).

    2Btb--45 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many faint clay films coating sand grains and lining pores; 35 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Pima County, Arizona; 460 feet north and 1060 feet west of the southeast corner of section 7, T. 17 S., R. 15 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section part during July-September and December-March.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature - 66 to 72 degrees F.

The control section averages less than 18 percent clay

Depth to buried argillic horizon - 20 to 40 inches

Rock fragments - 0 to 65 percent in any one horizon; averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section

Calcium carbonate - Slightly to strongly effervescent and less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent at depths less than 40 inches; violently effervescent and as much as 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent at depths of more than 40 inches

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Agustin (AZ), Filaree (AZ), Hayhook (AZ), Lostman (AZ), Nasagold (CA), Pajarito (TX), and Pyxo (CA) series. All of these soils lack buried argillic horizons. In addition, Filaree, Lostman, and Nasagold soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30); Pyxo soils are in the Central California Coast Range.  All these soils are dry in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Hayhook soils are noncalcareous to depths of 20 inches or more. Pyxo soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock.  Pajarito soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sahuarita soils are on fan terraces and basin floors with slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in stratified alluvium from limestone, schist, phyllite, and granitic rock.  Elevation ranges from 2000 to 3600 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 230 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo, Bucklebar, Mohave, Stagecoach, and Pinaleno series.  Arizo soils are sandy-skeletal and are in drainageways.  Bucklebar and Mohave soils have argillic horizons.  Stagecoach and Pinaleno soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability above the buried argillic horizons and moderately slow or moderate within.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing and some homesites.  Vegetation is creosotebush, bush muhly, threeawn, fluffgrass, whitestem paperflower, desert zinnia, and annual forbs and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  These soils are moderately extensive (MLRA 40).
