SICKLESTEETS SERIES

The Sicklesteets series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slide deposits derived from calcareous rock sources.  These soils are on mountain slopes and landslides.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Sicklesteets clay loam, forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oi--0 to 1.5 inches; slightly needles and twigs.

 Oe--1.5 to 2 inches; moderately decomposed organic humus layer containing some charcoal; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (combined thickness of O horizons - 1 to 3 inches)

 E--2 to 10 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) clay loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; strong coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

 Bt1--10 to 18 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay with light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) on faces of peds; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; strong fine blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; continuous prominent clay films and very dark brown (10YR 2/2) organic staining in root channels and on some vertical faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--18 to 29 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) cobble clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) broken and brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium blocky structure, parting to strong fine blocky; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; continuous prominent clay films and organic staining of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) in root channels and on some vertical faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 horizons - 12 to 40 inches)

 Btk1--29 to 47 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) cobbly clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; common prominent clay films along root channels and on some faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and cobbles, and a few stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 18 inches thick)

 Btk2--47 to 72 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) extremely cobbly clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak and moderate, fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few roots; few prominent clay films along root channels; 60 percent gravel and cobbles, and a few stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
