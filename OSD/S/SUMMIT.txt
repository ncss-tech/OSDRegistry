SUMMIT SERIES

The Summit series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey colluvium or residuum weathered from shales of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on interfluves, divides, and hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no others series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Summit soils are on interfluves, divides, and hillslopes on plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in calcareous clayey colluvium or residuum weathered from shales of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1194 mm (35 to 47 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 65 degrees F). Elevation is 165 to 395 meters (540 to 1295 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 64 to 82. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Apperson, Catoosa, Claremore, Dennis, Lula, Newtonia, Okemah, Shidler, and Woodson soils. Apperson, Catoosa, Claremore, Lula, Newtonia, and Shidler soils are at higher elevations. Dennis, Okemah, and Woodson soils are intermingled with this soil or they are at lower elevations. Catoosa, Claremore, Lula, and Newtonia soils are fine-silty. In addition, Catoosa soils have bedrock between depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches); Claremore and Shidler soils have bedrock within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 inches) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff ranges from low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are cultivated to general field crops on 0 to 5 percent slopes. The steeper slopes and part of gentler slopes are used for native range and pasture. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 112 and 116 in northwestern Arkansas, southeastern Kansas, southwestern Missouri, and eastern Oklahoma. The type location is in MLRA 112. The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bates County, Missouri; 1903.

REMARKS: 12/2015 revision: updated landforms and added somewhat poorly drained class based on review of NASIS database; added metric units; updated terminology used to describe redox features; added depth to perched water table; added MLRA 116 to extent.

Evaluation of the drainage class and depth to water table is needed as part of MLRA update projects.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for the typical pedon (User Pedon ID S1973OK131001 or Lab Number 40A4748) from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.
