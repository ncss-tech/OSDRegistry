STEILACOOM SERIES

The Steilacoom series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial lacustrine sediments. Steilacoom soils are on glacial drift plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, isotic, mesic Aquic Dystroxerepts

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Steilacoom soils are on glacial drift plains at elevations ranging from near sea level to about 100 meters. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in concavities in relict glacial lacustrine sediments. These soils occur in a mild marine climate. Summers are cool and dry and winters are mild and wet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1219 millimeters. The mean January temperature is 2 degrees C., mean July temperature is 24 degrees C., and mean annual temperature is 9.4 degrees C. The frost-free season is 200 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alderwood, Everett, and Indianola soils. All of these series are on in upland positions on glacial outwash and drift plains. Alderwood soils have a dense horizon and are loamy-skeletal. Everett soils are sandy-skeletal.  Indianola soils are sandy. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; an apparent water table occurs at 0 to 50 cm from the soil surface during November through March, ponding is occasional during these months. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to moderately high in A and B horizons and very slow in the C horizon. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly woodland and pasture. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, red alder, bigleaf maple, and willows, with understory of western brackenfern, western swordfern, salal, Oregon-grape, trailing blackberry, red huckleberry, vine maple, evergreen huckleberry, red elderberry, and wild ginger. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Washington; MLRA 2. The series is of small extent.
