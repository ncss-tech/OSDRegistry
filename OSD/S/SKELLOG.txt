SKELLOG SERIES

The Skellog series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, alluvium, and till derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks. The Skellog soils are on mountain slopes and drainageways of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mazdale (MLRA 6) soils. Mazdale soils contain 16 to 25 percent clay in the particle size control section and have ashy surface textures.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Skellog soils are on linear to convex backslopes of mountain slopes and drainageways. Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium, alluvium, and till derived from granite, granodiorite, and schist. Elevation is 1180 to 2600 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 660 to 1140 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free season is 105 to 205 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canyonview, Gratwell, and Littlebaugh soils. The Canyonview soils are on convex backslopes of mountain slopes and are sandy-skeletal. The Gratwell soils are on broadly concave backslopes of mountain slopes and are coarse-loamy. The Littlebaugh soils are on convex structural benches on mountain slopes and have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is white fir, sugar pine, incense cedar, and giant sequoia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
