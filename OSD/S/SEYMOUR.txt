SEYMOUR SERIES

The Seymour series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on convex ridgetops and side slopes on dissected till plains and on treads on stream terraces in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 2 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Wayne County, Iowa, 1952.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from 48 to 98 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 163 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 38 centimeters (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 163 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and Btg5 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Aquertic subgroup based on colors within the BAg horizon and linear extensibility greater than 6.0 centimeters between the surface and a depth of 100 centimeters.

Depth to clay maximum decreases as gradient increases on convex slopes.  

Differentia between the Seymour and Wymore series needs further study.
