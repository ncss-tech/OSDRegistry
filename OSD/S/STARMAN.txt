STARMAN SERIES

The Starman series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum from calcareous sedimentary rock. These soils are on mountain slopes, hills, and ridges. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous Lithic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Starman very gravelly loam in rangeland at an elevation of 2,477 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A--0 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; few very fine vesicular pores; 40 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 cm thick)

   C--10 to 20 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2); massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 36 cm thick)

   R--20 cm; hard, calcareous sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Carbon County, Wyoming; 204 meters south and 597 meters west of the northeast corner of section. 31, T. 17 N., R. 87 W.; Middlewood Hill USGS quadrangle; Latitude 41 degrees 24 minutes 34.31 seconds N. and longitude 107 degrees 14 minutes 4.55 seconds W., NAD83.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - mountain slopes, hills, and ridges
Elevation - 1,800 to 2,800 meters 
Slopes - 0 to 70 percent
Parent Material - slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum from calcareous sedimentary rock
Mean annual precipitation - 380 to 560 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 4 degrees C
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Midfork, Roxal, Starley and Woosley soils. Midfork soils are deep and have a mollic epipedon. Starley soils have a mollic epipedon. Roxal soils have a paralithic contact within 50 cm. Woosley soils have a mollic epipedon and an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, mock goldenweed, and spiny phlox. Some areas have an overstory of Douglas-fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Starman soils are of moderate extent in central and western Wyoming, northwestern Colorado, and eastern Idaho. MLRAs 43B, 46, and 48A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Teton County, Wyoming, Grand Teton National Park Area; 1976.

Remarks: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 10 cm (A horizon)
Lithic contact - at 20 cm (R horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 0 to 20 cm (A and C horizons)

Starman soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

Note: There are significant acres of Starman soils mapped with Bk horizons. These soils, along with the type location should be investigated to determine correct horizon designations and classification.
