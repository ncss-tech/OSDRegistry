SAYPO SERIES

The Saypo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium.  These soils are in depressional areas on alluvial fans, stream terraces, glacial outwash plains and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Saypo clay loam 0 to 2 percent slopes, rangeland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine and medium pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--7 to 15 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine granular; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots and few medium roots; common fine pores; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk3--25 to 48 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry, many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations and few fine gray (10YR 5/1) redox depletions; massive; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; about 10 percent pebbles; few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 31 inches thick)

    C--48 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry, many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations and common fine gray (10YR 5/1) redox depletions; massive; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; about 25 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Teton County, Montana; 1,700 feet east and 1,000 feet south of the NW corner of sec. 22, T. 26 N., R. 7 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.
Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 12 inches.

In some pedons the dark soil colors, moist, may extend to 16 inches, but from 12 to 16 inches this layer meets the qualifications for a calcic horizon.  A thin O horizon ranging from 0 to 3 inches thick is allowed.  Some pedons have gleyed horizons below a depth of 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - depressional areas on alluvial fans, stream terraces, glacial outwash plains and flood plains.
Elevation - 3,800 to 5,600 feet.
Slope - 0 to 6 percent.
Parent material - calcareous alluvium derived mostly from limestone, dolomite, and sandstone.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; and warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 19 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free season is 70 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Judell, Judith, Tetonview, Truchot, and Windham soils. The Judell, Judith, and Windham soils are well drained. Tetonview soils are poorly drained. Truchot soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Saypo soils are used mainly for rangeland and hayland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly northern reedgrass, tufted hairgrass, northern mannagrass, and shrubby cinquefoil.  Kentucky bluegrass and timothy are major increasers under irrigation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Saypo soils are of moderate extent in central and western Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Choteau-Conrad Area, parts of Teton and Pondera Counties, Montana, 1991; proposed in Teton County, Montana, 1982.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0752.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (A horizon); a calcic horizon from 7 to 48 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons).  Saypo soils are calcareous throughout, have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
