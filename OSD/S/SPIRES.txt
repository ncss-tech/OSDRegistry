SPIRES SERIES

The Spires series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum over limestone.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping interfluves and side slopes of dissected plateaus.  Slope range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Spires loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; very hard, friable; many very fine and fine roots, 5 percent fragments of chert 15 to 100 mm (1/2 to 4 in) in diameter; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 10 to 18 cm [4 to 7 in])

   Bt--15 to 71 cm (6 to 28 in); dark red (10R 3/6) clay, dark red (10R 3/6) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few very fine and fine roots, many distinct clay films on vertical surfaces of peds; few distinct clay films on horizontal surfaces of peds; 10 percent fragments of chert and an occasional cobble of chert; few earthworm burrows; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Thickness is 41 to 84 cm [16 to 33 in])

   R--71 to 76 cm (28 to 30 in); indurated fractured crystalline limestone, partially weathered in upper one inch.

TYPE LOCATION:  Bandera County, Texas; in native rangeland, approximately 60 feet west to pasture road; 0.6 mile south and 0.25 mile east to Ranch Road 187, which point is 10.6 miles south to Vanderpool, Texas.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. Similar series include Bexar, Hensley, Lindy, Pontotoc, and Scullin series.  
Bexar soils: have a mollic epipedon and colors do not meet rhodic  
Hensley soils: are less than 51 cm (20 in) deep over limestone.  
Lindy soils: do not have an abrupt textural change between the A and the Bt horizons 
Pontotoc soils: have less than 18 percent clay in the upper 51 cm (20 in) of the Bt horizon and are formed over sandstone
Scullin: soils have a mollic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum weathered from limestone
Landscape: dissected plateaus
Landform: summit, shoulder, and backslopes of interfluves and sideslopes
Slope: 1 to 8 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 610 to 889 mm (24 to 35 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 36 to 44
Mean annual air temperature: 17.2 o 20.6 degrees C (63 to 69 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 210 to 250
Elevation: 487.7 to 731.5 m (1600 to 2400 ft)  
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Comfort, Eckrant, Tarpley, and Tarrant series.
Comfort soils: occurs on similar landscape positions and are skeletal and shallow to limestone bedrock
Eckrant soils: occur on steeper sloping ridges, are shallow to limestone bedrock, and have no argillic horizon
Tarpley soils: occur on similar landscape positions and are shallow to limestone bedrock
Tarrant soils: occur on steeper sloping ridges and are skeletal calcic soils shallow to limestone bedrock

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Well. 
Permeability class: very slow. 
Runoff: high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high from 1 to 8 percent slopes.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use is for rangeland.  This is a post oak, live oak savannah.  Principal grasses are bluestems, Indiangrass, dropseed, and Texas wintergrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Texas in the Edwards Plateau Land Resource Area (MLRAs 81B and 81C).  The series is of moderate extent, exceeding an estimated 50,000 acres.
