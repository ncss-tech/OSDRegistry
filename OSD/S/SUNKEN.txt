Flooding--Occasional, very brief durations (tidal)

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Sunken soils are mainly used for their important ecological and environmental benefits as wetland wildlife habitat.  Sunken soil mapunit areas are experiencing tidal salt marsh ecosystem conversion as the marsh is slowly migrating to these low-lying upland forested areas.  Sunken soils provide essential plant and animal habitat, water quality benefits, and coastal protection from storms and sea level rise. 
Natural Vegetation--Typically consist of stunted loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), marsh-elder (Iva frutescens), poison ivy (Rhus radicans), and groundsel-tree (Baccharis halimifolia).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Coastal plain of Maryland and Delaware
Land Resource Regions (LRR)-- S - Northern Atlantic Slope Diversified Farming Region and T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s)--149A, 153C, 153D
Extent--Moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SPECIAL PROJECTS OFFICE

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dorchester County, Maryland, 1992. The name is coined from the Sunken Island Marsh.

REMARKS:
Sunken soils were previously mapped as Tidal Marsh and Swamp miscellaneous areas and with the Elkton and Othello soil series as inclusions in the low phase map units. These soils may become extremely acid if drained. Sunken soils are classified as Alfisols due to elevated base saturation (35 percent or greater) resulting from saturation with base-rich saline water (sum of base saturation analysis conducted at the University of Maryland in 1988 on samples averaged 63 percent).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
Fibric soil materials--the zone from 0 and 5 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is three-fourths, by volume
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 5 to 10 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth, by volume
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 46 centimeters (Oi, Oa, Ag, Eg horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 46 to 165 centimeters (Btg1 and 2Btg2 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity--97 to 200 centimeters
Particle size control section--46 to 96 centimeters (Btg1 horizon)
