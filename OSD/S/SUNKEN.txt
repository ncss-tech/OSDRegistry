SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dorchester County, Maryland, 1992. The name is coined. 

REMARKS: 
This soil was previously included in the tidal marsh and swamp miscellaneous areas; and in the Elkton and Othello soil series as inclusions in the low phase map units.
These soils become extremely acid when drained.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) (Oi, Oa, Ag, Eg horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 46 to 165 centimeters (18 to 65 inches) (Btg1 and 2Btg2 horizons)
Aquic conditions-- the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters (0 to 72 inches)
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Lithologic discontinuity--97 to 183 centimeters (38 to 72 inches)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 152 centimeters (0 to 60 inches)
