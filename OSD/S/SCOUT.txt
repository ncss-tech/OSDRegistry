SCOUT SERIES

The Scout series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in till, colluvium, slope alluvium, and residuum from sandstone, conglomerate, basalt, quartzite, rhyolite, andesite, and tuff.  Scout soils are on mountain slopes, mesa summits, broad ridge tops, and spur ridges and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scout soils are on very steep mountain slopes, mesa summits, broad ridge tops, and spur ridges at elevations of 6,500 to 12,200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent, commonly with north and east aspect.  These soils formed in till, colluvium, and residuum from sandstone, conglomerate, basalt, quartzite, rhyolite, andesite, and tuff.  The climate is humid.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 to 45 inches and comes mostly as snow during the winter months.  The mean annual temperature is 34 to 40 F., the mean summer temperature is 48 to 55 F., and freeze-free period is 30 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Curtis Creek, Hoskin, Lucky Star, and Spearhead soils.  Curtis Creek, Hoskin, and Lucky Star soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Spearhead soils have thick mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow and medium runoff; moderately rapid to very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed and timber production.  The native vegetation is Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, widely spaced aspen, blue wildrye, mountain brome, and bearded wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High mountain areas of central and northern Utah and western Colorado.  MLRA 47, 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.
