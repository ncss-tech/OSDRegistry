STREVELL SERIES



The Strevell series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that have

moderate permeability.  They have formed in mixed alluvium on coalesced

fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The average annual

temperature is about 46 degrees F; the average annual precipitation is

about 10 inches.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocalcids



TYPICAL PEDON:  Strevell silt loam - rangeland.  On a 2 percent smooth

slope, west aspect, 4,920 feet elevation.  The profile was moist

throughout when described.  Colors are for air dry soil unless

otherwise stated.  This profile was described on May 19, 1982.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bertelson, Declo, Eccles, Escalante,

Palisade, and Somsen series.  Bertelson soils formed in alluvium

derived from volcanic tuff and igneous rocks and have a bulk density of

less than 1.2 gr/cc.  Declo soils average less than 15 percent gravel

in the control section and lack very gravelly horizons.  Eccles and

Escalante soils have moderately coarse and coarse textures throughout

the control section.  Palisade soils lack coarse fragments and a

lithologic discontinuity in the control section.  Somsen soils are

moderately deep to bedrock.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Strevell soils are on coalesced fan terraces.

Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,400 to

5,600 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium.  The average annual

precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches; the average annual air

temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F; and the frost-free season is

95 to 130 days.  Strevell soils are normally saline.  Where this soil

is used for irrigated crops, the soil is nonsaline to slightly saline.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darkbull, Declo, and

Mellor soils.  Darkbull soils have a skeletal control section.  Mellor

soils have a natric horizon and a fine silty control section.  They are

on fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately permeable; slow to

medium runoff.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Strevell soils are used for rangeland and

irrigated crops.  The native vegetation is Greasewood, bottlebrush

squirreltail, shadscale, and Nuttall saltbush.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This series is moderately extensive in south

central Idaho.
