STALLONE SERIES

The Stallone series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in debris flow deposits derived from monzonite.  These gently to strongly sloping soils are on bouldery alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Debris flow deposits derived from monzonite
Landform: Alluvial fans
Slope: 5 to 15 percent
Mean annual temperature: 58 to 61 degrees
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 14 inches
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 140 to 180 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brewster and Sotol soils. 
Brewster soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and are on mountain tops and flanks.
Sotol soils have argillic horizons and are on mountain flanks and bases.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is high .

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is of the mixed prairie type consisting of black grama, sideoats grama, tanglehead, plains bristlegrass, mesquite, and Torry's yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dona Ana County, New Mexico; 2001.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (C1, C2, and C3 horizons)

Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 8 inches. (A, and Bw horizons).

Aridic feature: an ustic moisture regime that borders on the aridic moisture regime.

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
