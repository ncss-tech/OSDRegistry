STANLEY SERIES

The Stanley series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from shale. Stanley soils are on playa floors that receive an additional 2 to 5 inches of moisture from run-on in some years. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Aridic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON: Stanley clay--on a playa floor sloping less than 1 percent at 6,854 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on May 28, 2002, the soil was dry from 0 to 23 inches, slightly moist from 23 to 37 inches, and moist from 37 to 100 inches.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section (SMCS) is intermittently moist in some part from July to October and December to March. Additional run-on occurs from July through September. The soils are driest in May and June. The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.

COMPETING SERIES: Currently, there are no competing series.  A similar soil in a different family is the Moriartche series.  Morartche soils are fine and have a superactive activity class. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stanley soils are on playa floors. They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from shale. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. These soils receive an additional 2 to 5 inches of run-on moisture from flooding. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kwahe and Triane soils.  Kwahe soils are fine and are on playa steps.  Triane soils are fine, have a cambic horizon, and are on playa rims.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; runoff is negligible; permeability is very slow. These soils are rarely ponded for long to very long periods in some years. After being ponded for a few days, the soil saturates at the surface, forms a perched water table, and wets deeper over time under sustained inundation.

USE AND VEGETATION: Stanley soils are used for livestock grazing and ponds. Present vegetation consists of annual weeds.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Stanley soils are of small extent in the northeastern part of the Estancia Basin in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico, MLRA 70C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona. 

SERIES PROPOSED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2002.  The name Stanley is taken from the name of a town in Santa Fe county.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 inches to a depth of about 3 inches. (A horizon) 
Redoximorphic features - 3 to 101 inches (Bss horizons).

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

Note: This soil occurs in association with soils that have an ustic aridic soil moisture regime; however this soil receives additional moisture from surrounding areas due to landscape position.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location has been sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S-NM-02-049-09; Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a field calcimeter.
