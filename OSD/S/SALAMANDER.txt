SALAMANDER SERIES

The Salamander series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thin eolian material over old alluvium derived from igneous material and shale.  Salamander soils are on paleoterrace.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Typic Calcigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Salamander very fine sandy loam, on a south facing, 2 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 5,360 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on 4/20/1998 the soil was dry.

    A--0 to 3 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4), very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4)  moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; 4 percent calcium carbonate; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk--3 to 10 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, common medium, and common fine roots throughout;  18 percent calcium carbonate; 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    2Bk--10 to 27 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) extremely gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine roots throughout and common very fine throughout; many fine irregular soft masses of carbonate throughout; 45 percent calcium carbonate; 75 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 35 inches thick)

    2Bky--27 to 35 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) extremely gravelly gypsiferous coarse sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; many coarse irregular soft masses of carbonate and gypsum throughout; violently effervescent, 10 percent calcium carbonates; 20 percent gypsum; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick) 

    2By1--35 to 50 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely gravelly gypsiferous fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; many coarse irregular nests of gypsum around stones, 5 percent calcium carbonates; 29 percent gypsum; 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 60 inches thick 2By horizons)

    2By2--50 to 80 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly gypsiferous fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots throughout; common medium irregular gypsum threads throughout; slightly effervescent; 7 percent calcium carbonate; 24 percent gypsum; 65 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
