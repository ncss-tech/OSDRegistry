COMPETING SERIES: These are the no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Anahuac, Faddin, Labelle, and Morey series.
Anahuac soils: less than 50 percent base saturation in some part of the solum 
Faddin and Labelle soils: vertic properties with 50 cm (20 in) of the soil surface
Morey soils: have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age
Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: flat
Microfeature: pimple mound
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.0 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months.
Frost-free period: 270 to 300 days
Elevation: 3 to 30.5 m (10 to 100 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aris, Anahuac, Labelle, Levac, Orcadia,  Meaton, and the Morey  series. 
Aris soils: are gray throughout due to wetness; are on flats
Anahuac and Orcadia soils: are on a broader landform
Labelle and Morey soils: somewhat poorly drained; on flats
Levac-soils: somewhat poorly drained; are truncated pimple mounds

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: moderately well drained. Runoff is low to medium. Permeability is very slow. Rarey flooded for very brief to brief periods. Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils have episaturation from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 40 in) below the soil surface from January to March and endosaturation from 150 to 203 cm (49 to 80 in) below the surface during the same period.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for pasture and hayland. Pastures are bahiagrass or bermudagrass. A few areas are used for horticultural crops. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, mainly species of andropogons, paspalums, switchgrass, and indiangrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Gulf Coast Prairie of Texas east of the Trinity River and possibly in Louisiana; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A; the series is of minor extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Jefferson County, Texas, 1996. The name comes from a local oil field

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Anahuac series based on landform and chemistry. Anahuac soils do not meet the base saturation requirements necessary for the mollisols order and these soils are broader landforms. The series type location was moved from Jefferson County, Texas to its current location due to the presence of laboratory data.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 37 to 87 cm (15 to 35 in. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons))

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 26 cm (0 to 10 in). (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 37 to 203 cm (15 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Btkg, Btg horizons)
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation at 177 to 203 cm (70 to 80 in). (Btkg, and Btg horizons)
Episaturation: The zone of saturation at 37 to 50 cm (15 to 20 in). (Bt1 horizon)

Additional Comments:  Electrical conductivity values increase above 2 in those areas impacted by storm surge and become sodic. The saltwater damages plants for a period up to a year after the storm but will recover to pre-storm levels if the area receives normal rainfall.

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data exists on pedon S10TX0713682 from the type location and on S2012TX291009. Additional information exists on pedon S10TX0713680, S10TX0712762, and S12TX2451002; however, these pedons are taxadjuncts to the series.
