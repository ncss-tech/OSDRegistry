SCOTAH SERIES

The Scotah series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on level or gently undulating high flats and natural levees on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dunn County, Wisconsin, 1997.  The name is coined. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 centimeters (A horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 56 centimeters (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons);
wetness feature--redoximorphic features at a depth of 117 centimeters (C2 horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Prior to 1996, the Scotah soils were mapped as the Abscota series which has been reclassified as Oxyaquic Udipsamments.
