SULPHURCREEK SERIES

The Sulphurcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Sulphurcreek soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches(229 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F (11.1 degrees C).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Balon (AZ), Blancot (NM), Bowbac (WY), Buckle (NM), Cambria (WY), Cerropelon (NM), Chilerojo (NM), Chilojo (I) (NM) Cumacho (NM), Cushman (WY), Decolney (WY), Doakum (NM), Forkwood (WY), Fort (CO)(T), Gaddes (AZ), Gapmesa (CO), Hagerman (NM), Hagerwest (I) (NM), Hiland (WY), Mentmore (NM), Oelop (NM), Olney (CO), Palacid (NM), Penistaja (NM), Pokeman (WY), Potts (WY), Pugsley (WY), Quagwa (AZ), Redpen (NM), Spangler (WY), Sundance (CO), Tamarindo (NM)(T), Teckla (WY), and Yenlo (CO) series. Balon, Blancot, Decolney, Doakum, Fort, Mentmore, and Yenlo soils typically have hue yellower than 5YR in the Bt horizon.  Bowbac, Cerropelon, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Pokeman, Pugsley and Spangler soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths between 20 and 40 inches. Buckle, Oelop, Palacid, Penistaja, Quagwa, Redpen, and Tamarindo soils have layers of secondary carbonate accumulations. Chilerojo soils are very deep to a densic horizon. Cumacho soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Chilojo and Hagerwest soils are inactive. Sundance soils have buried paleosol horizons. Teckla soils contain 35 to 70 percent porcelanite rock fragments below a 20 to 40 inch depth. In addition, the Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Decolney, Forkwood, Fort, Hagerman, Hiland, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance, Tekla and Yenlo series reflect the soil forming factors of the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sulphurcreek soils are on stream terraces at elevations of 5,425 to 5,525 feet (1,645 to 1,675m). Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Sulphurcreek soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches (229 to 330mm) which occurs as summer thunderstorms and light winter rain and snow. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 54 degrees F (7.8 to 12 degrees C.). The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mulford(UT), Tineoyler(UT)(T), and Radnik(UT) series.  The Mulford and Tineoyler soils lack an argillic horizon.  The Radnik soils are fluvents and are on floodplain steps.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderately rapid permeability, rarely or very rarely flooded for very brief periods during the months of July to September.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sulphurcreek soils are used for irrigated farmland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes Fremont cottonwood, rubber rabbitbrush, fourwing saltbush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Capitol Reef National Park, Utah; LRR D, MLRA 35; Sulphurcreek soils are of limited extent.

REMARKS: Sulphurcreek is the name of the creek that formed the stream terrace that contains the type location in the historic Fruita distict of Capitol Reef National Park. The Sulphurcreek soils exhibit unexpected soil development in the form of pronounced argillic horizons and structure. The landscape position (stream terrace) and parent material (alluvium) would suggest poorly developed soils. It is hypothesized that over 100 years of irrigation has increased the rate of pedogenSis. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section - the zone from 3 to 12 inches (8 to 30 cm)  (Bt horizons)

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (0 to 8 cm)  (Ap horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 12 inches (8 to 30 cm)  (Bt horizons)
