STEMPLE SERIES

The Stemple series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from igneous or metamorphic rock, or alpine till.  These soils are on mountain slopes, moraines and landslides.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Palecryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Stemple very channery loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; forest litter of partially decomposed needles, twigs, and roots; abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    E1--2 to 12 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very channery loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; 40 percent channers; 5 percent flagstones; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 16 inches thick)

    E2--12 to 30 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) extremely channery loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 65 percent channers; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 30 inches thick)

    E/Bt--30 to 34 inches; E part (80 percent) pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) extremely channery loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist tongues; B part (20 percent) light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; many silt and sand skeletans on faces of peds; 70 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt--34 to 70 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) extremely channery clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; many faint silt and sand skeletans on faces of peds in upper 2 inches of horizon; 55 percent angular channers and 10 percent flagstones; moderately acid (pH 5.8).
