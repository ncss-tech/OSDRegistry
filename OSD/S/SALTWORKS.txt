SALTWORKS SERIES

The Saltworks series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Saltworks soils are on drainageways, alluvial flats, or playas on basin floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C. (37 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aeric Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Saltworks coase sandy loam, on a 0.5 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 2724 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 28, 2007 the soil was moist.

       Az--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; friable, moderately hard, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; common fine roots; common carbonate masses and common salt masses; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

       Bknz--15 to 56 cm (6 to 22 inches); olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately hard, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; common fine roots; common light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common salt masses and common carbonate masses; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 51 cm thick)

       Bknzg--56 to 152 cm (22 to 60 inches); olive (5Y 4/3) clay, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; friable, extremely hard, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; many olive (5Y 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; common salt masses; noneffervescent (1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1). (71 to 114 cm thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family. The Spinth series, in a closely related family, has less than 35 percent noncarbonate clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from mixed sources, but including a significant source of tuff and breccia

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hartsel and Gebson series.  The Hartsel soils are moderately well drained, have calcic horizons, and are on rises on basin floors.  The Gebson soils well drained and are on pediments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  poorly drained, slow permeability. This soil is subject to frequent long periods of ponding from April through August.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists mainly of alkali cordgrass, alkali bluegrass, inland saltgrass, seablite, Baltic rush, and alkaligrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado, LRR E, MLRA 48B; small extent.
