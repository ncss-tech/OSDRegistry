SNOWMORE SERIES

The Snowmore series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess over residuum derived from basalt and rhyolite.  Snowmore soils are on summits, shoulders and side slopes of plateaus, mountains, calderas, structural benches and hills. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Snowmore cobbly fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent small stones.

(0 to 20 cm thick).

    Bqk--41 to 56 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; continuous weak silica and lime cementation; 20 percent brittle durinodes; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; common fine lime in soft masses and filaments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.   (0 to 50 cm thick).

    Bqkm--56 to 71 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick).

    2R--71 cm; rhyolite bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:   These are the Arbidge, Dacker, Deerlodge, Ditchcamp, Drysel, Exel, Hager, Idow, Lowjet, Rakane, Wako, Wellsed and Wendell series.  

Arbidge, Dacker, Deerlodge, Exel, Lojet Rakane, Wellsed and Wendell soils lack bedrock within 100 cm.  Ditchcamp soils are slightly acid or neutral and lack lime in their duripans.  Drysel, Idow, and Rankane soils are not underlain by bedrock below the duripan.  Hager and Wako soils have bedrock at 100 to 150 cm. Wendell soils do not contain a Bg horizon that has a continuous brittle matrix.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Snowmore soils are on summits, shoulders and side slopes of tablelands, calderas, structural benches, plateaus, mountains and hills. They formed in loess over residuum derived from basalt or rhyolite.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,070 to 1,865 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Colthorp, Linkup, Ratsow, and Reina series.  Colthorp and Reina soils are shallow to a duripan.  Linkup soils are shallow over bedrock.  Ratsow soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, Webber ricegrass, Letterman needlegrass, and Nevada bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada and southwestern Idaho.  MLRA 25, 24, 11.  Snowmore soils are moderately extent.
