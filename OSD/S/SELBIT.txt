SELBIT SERIES

The Selbit series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Selbit soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic, shallow Torriorthentic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Selbit very gravelly coarse sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 40 percent gravel, 5 percent with cobbles and 15 percent with boulders.

    A1--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; very weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very stony loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, few coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 35 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    A3--28 to 43 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very stony loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and medium, few coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 28 cm thick)

    Cr--43 to 152 cm; soft granitic grus with many very fine and few fine and medium roots along weak fractures.

TYPE LOCATION: Pershing County, Nevada; about 150 feet south and 2,500 feet west of the northeast  corner of section 27, T. 29 N., R. 24 E.; USGS Purgatory Peak 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 21 minutes 36.4 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 16 minutes 37.4 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.3601111 latitude, -119.2770556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry from July through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 36 to 50.
Depth to paralithic contact: 36 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.
Other features: Profile is noneffervescent throughout.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 3 to 8 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly stones and gravel.

A1 horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry.
Chroma: 2 or 3.

A2 and A3 horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Very stony loamy coarse sand, very stony sand, very stony loamy sand.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Selbit soils are on convex mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,650 to 2,475 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Eaglerock series. Eaglerock soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, Antelope bitterbrush, desert needlegrass, Indian ricegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Nevada. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 23.
