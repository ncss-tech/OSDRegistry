SECO SERIES

The Seco series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from basalt. Seco soils are on valley floors and edges of playas. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Seco clay loam--in rangeland on an east facing slope of 2 percent at an elevation of 8,350 feet. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt-- 3 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many prominent clay films coating faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Btss--11 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films coating faces of peds; common slickensides and pressure faces; cracks less than 1/4 inch wide extend from 11 to 28 inches; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual irregular boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 19 to 58 inches.)

    Btkss--23 to 58 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films coating faces of peds; common fine and medium distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist redox depletions; common slickensides and pressure faces; calcium carbonate is segregated as few fine soft masses and as coats on soft weathered basalt pebbles; matrix is noneffervescent, soft masses and coats are strongly effervescent; 2 percent soft weathered basalt pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 35 inches thick)

    2BCg--58 to 70 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; very few very fine roots; very few very fine irregular pores; common fine and medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; few fine soft white noneffervescent masses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4). (0 to 12 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Seco soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from basalt (associated with the Mt. Taylor and Mesa Chivato volcanic fields) and are on valley floors and edges of playas.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 8,000 to 8,400 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chivato soils on playas; and the Canoneros and Montillo soils on lava plateaus and cinder cones. The Chivato soils lack argillic horizons and have cracks extending to the surface. The Canoneros and Montillo soils are shallow and moderately deep to basalt, respectively. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, high to very high runoff, and very slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for rangeland. The present vegetation is fringed sage, cinquefoil, broom snakeweed, Arizona fescue, bottlebrush squirreltail, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central, New Mexico; MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
