SWALA SERIES

The Swala series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loess influenced residuum from travertine. Swala soils are found on slopes of 2 to 40 percent on travertine terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Swala very stony silt loam, located on a south facing loess mantled dissected travertine terrace side slope with a slope of 32 percent and elevation of 1,885 meters. When described on August 16th, 1989 the soil was dry throughout (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

 A--0 to 8 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky parting to weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular and vesicular pores; few fine irregular soft secondary calcium carbonate masses and disseminated calcium carbonate; 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately effervescent; 10 percent travertine gravel, 5 percent travertine cobbles and 20 percent travertine stones; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary

 Bk1--8 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; few fine irregular soft secondary calcium carbonate masses and disseminated calcium carbonate; 55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; 10 percent travertine gravel, 5 percent travertine channers and 10 percent travertine flagstones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary

 Bk2--25 to 38 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam,  dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine irregular pores; many medium irregular soft secondary calcium carbonate masses and disseminated calcium carbonate; 65 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; 20 percent travertine gravel, 15 percent travertine channers and 20 percent travertine flagstones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt wavy boundary

 R--38 cm; very strongly cemented travertine

COMPETING SERIES:
Hymas - Lack B horizons with identifiable secondary calcium carbonate accumulations

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Iphill - very deep; well drained on south and west-facing convex slopes on loess covered travertine terraces 
Rexburg - very deep; well drained on west-facing smooth slopes on loess covered travertine terraces 
Spaa taxadjunct - moderately deep; less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section; on similar positions as Swala
Wospring - very deep; poorly drained on higher positions of travertine terraces near springs

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  (Ksat)
Drainage class - Well drained
Ksat - Moderate

USE AND VEGETATION:
Use - Wildlife habitat
Potential natural vegetation - Mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bitter brush

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho; MLRA 13; small extent

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES PROPOSED: Caribou County, Idaho, 2015; the name is coined

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section - 25 to 38 cm
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 38 cm
Xeric moisture regime
Carbonatic mineralogy - particle-size control section averages greater than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent
A significant portion of the calcium carbonate increase is due to the larger amount of less than 20mm fragments of travertine
Lithic contact - 38 cm very strongly cemented travertine
