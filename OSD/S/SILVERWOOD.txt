SILVERWOOD SERIES

The Silverwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on stream terraces, kames, eskers, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Conotton, Dorerton, Hawksbill, Leoni, Lutzke, and Oakhill series. Conotton soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Dorerton soils has sandy-skeletal material from fragmented dolostone or limestone in the lower part of the series control section and dolostone or limestone bedrock underlies this material at depths of 114 to 190 cm (45 to 70 inches) or more. Hawksbill and Lutzke soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Leoni soil average more than 15 percent gravel in the surface horizons. Oakhill soils have a paralithic and lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Silverwood soils are on stream terraces, kames, eskers, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 152 to 213 meters (500 to 700 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adeland, Battleground, Cates, Genesee, Judyville, Loudonville, Miami, Mitiwanga, Ockley, Rainsville, Russell, and Stonelick soils. The somewhat poorly drained Adeland and Mitiwanga soils are on footslopes of structural benches. The well drained Battleground, Genesee, and Stonelick soils are on adjacent flood plains. The well drained Cates, Judyville, and Loudonville soils are moderately deep to bedrock. The well drained Ockley soils are on higher adjacent stream terraces and are deeper to very gravelly outwash. The moderately well drained Miami and Rainsville soils and the well drained Russell soils are on nearby moraines and are formed in till.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Depth to a seasonal high water table is greater than 183 cm (6 feet). The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the less sloping areas are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland or woodland. Native vegetation is dominantly mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central Indiana; MLRA 111D. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fountain County, Indiana, 1999.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as Fox soils. Investigations indicate that there is a higher content of rock fragments in the control section and that the solum is dominantly 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) in thickness.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (Ap, BE horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 36 to 124 cm (2Bt horizon).

The representative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153395 in MO 11.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for the typical pedon, S98IN-045-010, from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.
