STEEPSHRUB SERIES

The Steepshrub series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. Steepshrub soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryolls

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Steepshrub soils are on mountains. They typically are on backslope and shoulder positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,600 to 3,350 meters. The climate is subhumid, continental with cold, snowy winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cobblywheel and Keyole soils and the competing Berrycreek soil. Keyole and Cobblywheel soils do not have mollic epipedons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Steepshrub soils are used for recreation, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly slender wheatgrass, Letterman's needlegrass, mountain big sagebrush, and gooseberry currant. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028BY104NV, Loamy Slope 20+ P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
