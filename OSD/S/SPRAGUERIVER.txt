Bly soils are well drained and have an argillic horizon.  
Maset soils are well drained, have andic soil properties in the upper portion of the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  
Royst soils are well drained, have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - poorly
Permeability - moderate
Watertable - a seasonal water table is at its uppermost limit in April or May, and present April to August
Flooding - occurs in some areas during April or May

USE AND VEGETATION:  Spragueriver soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The soil supports both herbaceous dominated and forested plant communities.  The potential natural plant communities are the dry meadow plant series and the ponderosa pine/common snowberry flood plain plant association.  Common species in the herbaceous communities include Cusick's bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Baltic ruxh, bulbous bluegrass, fewflower spikerush, meadow death camas and poverty rush.  The forested communities consist of an overstory of ponderosa pine and quaking aspen and an understory of common snowberry, Saskatoon serviceberry or rose spirea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 21.  Series is of small extent.
