STARVEOUT SERIES

The Starveout series consist of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in alluvium from loess and basalt.  They are on canyon and drainage sides and have slopes of 3 to 45 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  and the average annual precipitation is about 18 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Starveout loam--rangeland.  On a 35 percent slightly convex slope, southwest aspect, 2700 feet elevation.  (The profile was very slightly moist below 21 inches when described on June 20, 1984.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky, plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt2--11 to 21 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (9 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt3--21 to 36 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt4--36 to 60 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Adams County, Idaho; about 3.5 miles south of the Oxbow Dam on the Snake River, 4000 feet east, 2800 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 9, T. 19 N., R. 4 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series recognized in this family.  Grosswell soils are similar.  Grosswell soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Starveout soils are on canyon and drainage toeslopes and sides.  Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1800 to 3600 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium from basalt with some influence of loess in the upper part of the profile.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 to 20 inches.  The average annual air temperature is about 46 to 48 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 110 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gwin, Rockly and McDaniels series.  Gwin soils are on north facing shoulder slopes and knolls and are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Rockly soils are on south facing shoulder slopes and knolls and are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  McDaniels soils are on the steeper sideslopes and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Medium to rapid runoff.  Moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Starveout soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and arrowleaf balsam root.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The soils of this series are not extensive in western Idaho.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Adams County, Idaho, 1992.  The name is from a local creek.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 36 inches (A, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 3 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons)
