SILSTID SERIES

The Silstid series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from beds of sandy or loamy materials and interbedded sandstones.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.

Robco soils: are in drains and footslopes in poorer drained positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 3 percent, very low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Largely in rangeland.  Small areas are cropped to peanuts or grain sorghum, or they are used as improved pasture.  Native vegetation is blackjack oak, post oak, and yaupon with an understory of mid and tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and north central Texas; Land Resource Region J - Southwestern Prairies Cotton and Forage Region; MLRA 87A - Texas Claypan Areas, Southern Part.  The series is of large extent.
