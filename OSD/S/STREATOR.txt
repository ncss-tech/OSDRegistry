STREATOR SERIES

The Streator series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess and the underlying till or lakebed sediments. These soils are on till plains or lake beds. Slope gradients commonly are less than one percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: These are Carlow, Chequest, Cove, Fults, Kalona, Kings, Lanyon, Mackerlake, Marna, Moline, Rosedell, Titus, Waldorf, and Woodbury soils. Carlow soils are moderately acid to very strongly acid in the middle third of the series control section. Chequest, Cove, Fults, and Kalona soils do not have carbonates within 152 cm (60 inches). Kings and Moline soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Lanyon and Rosedell soils have carbonates within a depth of 89 cm (35 inches). Mackerlake soils have a sodium absorption ratio that averages more than 8 in the lower two-thirds of the series control section. Marna, Titus, and Woodbury soils average less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Waldorf soils have a moist bulk density less than 1.55 gm/cc in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Streator soils are level to nearly level areas on till plains or lake beds of Wisconsinan Age. Streator soils formed in loess or silty material and in silty clay or clay till or lakebed sediments. Slope gradients commonly are less than one percent but range to 3 percent. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 mm (34 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 150 to 185 days, and elevation ranges from 187 to 231 meters (614 to 758 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The most common associates are the moderately well drained Wenona and the somewhat poorly drained Rutland soils that form a drainage sequence with the Streator soils. The Streator soils are also associated with the somewhat poorly drained Kernan soils which are better drained and have a lighter colored A horizon.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The potential for runoff is very low to negligible. The seasonal high water table is within 30 cm (1 foot) of the soil surface and there is frequent ponding during the period of January through May. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s) in the loess or silty material and moderately low to moderately high (0.14 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the till or lakebed sediments. Permeability is moderately slow in the loess or silty material and slow to very slow in the till or lakebed sediments.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for cultivated crops such as corn and soybeans. Native vegetation is marsh grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central and eastern Illinois. Extent is moderate in MLRAs 108 and 110.
