SCHAPVILLE SERIES

The Schapville series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 35 to 80 centimeters of loess or silty material and in the underlying residuum from shale bedrock. These soils are on ridgetops, high structural benches, and saddles between hills on bedrock-controlled uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Allamakee County, Iowa, 1950. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 75 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 101 centimeters (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4 and 2Cr horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 76 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons);
paralithic contact--the contact with shale bedrock at a depth of 76 centimeters (2Cr horizon);
udic moisture regime. 

In parts of MLRA 95B the drainage class of this soil is well drained based on definitions in the Soil Survey Manual. Drainage class is a state interpretation. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
