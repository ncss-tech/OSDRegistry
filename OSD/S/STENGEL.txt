STENGEL SERIES

The Stengel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits and in clayey lacustrine deposits and underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, slow or very slow in the clayey deposits, and rapid in the underlying sandy outwash.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey, smectitic, frigid Aquic Arenic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stengel loamy sand, on a south facing, plane slope of 1 percent, in a wooded area, at an elevation of about 990 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 4 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine to coarse roots; common very fine and fine moderate continuity tubular pores; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick) 

  Bw1--4 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine to medium roots; common medium strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

  Bw2--20 to 46 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation and few fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) iron depletions; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. 

  Bw3--46 to 50 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine prominent gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.   (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon ranges from 31 to 50 inches.)

  2Bt1--50 to 58 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay; moderate coarse lenticular platy structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; firm; very few prominent gray (2.5Y 6/1) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent gray (2.5Y 5/1) iron depletions; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  

  2Bt2--58 to 76 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) clay; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; common prominent gray (2.5Y 6/1) clay films on faces of peds; many coarse prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizon ranges from 6 to 30 inches.)

  3C--76 to 80 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; single grain; loose; slightly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Burnett County, Wisconsin; about 3 miles west of Siren; 540 feet east and 2500 feet north of the southwest corner of section 25, T. 39 N., R. 16 W.; USGS Siren East topographic quadrangle; lat. 45 degrees 50 minutes 36 seconds N. and long. 92 degrees 19 minutes 17 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 40 to 59 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 47 to 80 inches.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the sandy mantle, from extremely acid to slightly alkaline in the clayey deposits and from very strongly acid to neutral in the outwash.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 12 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 1 percent in the clayey lacustrine deposits and 0 to 5 percent in the sandy substratum.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon 6 to 9 inches thick, with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand.

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.

The 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Clay content ranges from 60 to 80 percent.  Thin subhorizons with less than 60 percent clay occur in some pedons. Redox features with chroma of 2 or less are always in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  

Some pedons have 2Btg horizons which have hue and value like the 2Bt, but have chroma of 1 or 2.

The 3C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: a mantle of sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits and underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits
Landform:  glacial lake plains  
Slope:  0 to 3 percent
Elevation:  960 to 1,100 feet
Mean annual temperature:  39 to 43 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation:  28 to 32 inches 
Frost-free period:  110 to 130 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dody, Karlsborg, Meenon, and Perida soils.  The Dody are on lower landscape positions and have 20 to 40 inches of sandy material above the clayey deposits.  The moderately well drained Karlsborg soils are on higher landscape positions and have 20 to 40 inches of sandy material above the clayey deposits.  The somewhat poorly drained Meenon soils are on similar landscape positions and have 20 to 40 inches of sandy deposits above the clayey deposits.  The moderately well drained Perida soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is low.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, slow or very slow in the clayey deposits, and rapid in the sandy substratum. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet at some time during the period of September to May in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is used for woodland.  Tree species include red maple, large-leaved aspen, red oak, and white oak.  Some areas are used for cultivated crops such as hay, small grains, and corn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Wisconsin.  LRR K, MLRA 91B. This soil is of small extent.
