MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES PROPOSED: Hancock County, Georgia, 2010 

REMARKS: 
In the Hancock County survey published in the 1970s, most of the delineations of the Cataula - Shoulderbone complex were mapped as Cecil with smaller amounts in Vance and Helena delineations.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon -- the zone from 0 to 8 inches (0 to 20 cm)
Argillic horizon -- the zone from 8 to 23 inches (20 to 58 cm)
Kandic horizon -- the zone from 8 to 23 inches (20 to 58 cm)
Paralithic contact -- the zone from 27 to 80 inches (69 to 203 cm)
