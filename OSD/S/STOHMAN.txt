STOHMAN SERIES

The Stohman series consists of soils that are very shallow or shallow, well drained, and moderately permeable above a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. These soils formed in a thin mantle of calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age over indurated caliche of Pliocene age. These soils are on nearly level and very gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).
