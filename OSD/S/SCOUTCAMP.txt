SCOUTCAMP SERIES

The Scoutcamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. Scoutcamp soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 milimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Scoutcamp soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex positions on mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 60 to 640 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rootcreek (CA), Redcrest (CA), and Salmoncreek (CA) soils. Rootcreek soils have redoximorphic features between 50 and 100 centimeters of the mineral soil surface. Redcrest soils have greater than 15 percent paragravels in the particle-size control section. Salmoncreek soils have redoximorphic features between 10 and 25 centimeter of the mineral soil surface.  Rootcreek soils are on concave positions and in drainageways. Redcrest soils are slightly convex to linear positions. Salmoncreek soils occur on broad summits, ridges, and mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, high to very high runoff, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for commercial timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes coast redwood, Douglas-fir, tanoak, California hazel, red alder, pacific madrone, California huckleberry, salal, western swordfern, thimbleberry, and red huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is moderately extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt County, California, South Part, 2010. The name is from a Boy Scout camp located on the Elk River, southeast of the town of Eureka, California. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (O and A horizons).
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 30 to 195 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and BCt horizons).
