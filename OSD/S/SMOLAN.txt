SMOLAN SERIES

The Smolan series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed from loess.  Smolan soils are on paleoterraces on river valleys or on hillslopes on uplands in Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters (32 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

Mean annual air temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F)  
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 165 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crete, Geary, Detroit, and Tobin soils.
Crete soils are on higher hillslopes or interfluves and do not have hues redder than 10YR.
Geary soils are on hillslopes and are fine-silty.
Detroit soils are on terraces and do not have hues redder than 10YR in the argillic. 
Tobin soils are on floodplains and are occasionally flooded.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: moderately well drained to well drained
Runoff: medium to high
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately low

USE AND VEGETATION:  Slopes of less than 6 percent are usually cultivated. Principal crops are wheat or sorghum. The steeper slopes and part of the gentler slopes are used for native range. Native vegetation is mid or tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Kansas and possibly adjacent parts of Nebraska; Land Resource Region H, Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; Major Land Resource Areas 74, Central Kansas Sandstone Hills and 76, Bluestem Hills.  The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Saline County, Kansas, 1952.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 61 centimeters (0 to 24 inches) (A, BA, and Bt1 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 46 to 76 centimeters (18 to 30 inches) (Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

3/2014 DJK Updated the intro (changed deep to very deep, edited landforms, added MLRA, updated MAP based on climate data). For landform changed high terrace to paleoterrace which is now more commonly used to describe these old terraces. Added elevation to typical pedon. Added BA to RIC. Added clay content, sand contents, redox, and CCE to RIC of horizons. Updated competing series (deleted Crete).  Updated geographically associated soils to only series associated at original type location or soil survey area.  Changed MAP from 26 to 33 inches to 28 to 36 inches. Added precipitation pattern and FFD to geographic setting. Changed runoff from rapid to high. Added LRR and MLRAs to Distribution and Extent.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) data available for pedon 99KS161012. An additional site was sampled and sent to Kansas State for analysis (pedon 11KS161101).
