SINBAD SERIES

The Sinbad series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and/or eolian sands derived from calcareous and gypsiferous interbedded sedimentary rocks.  Sinbad soils are on escarpments and hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sinbad channery sandy clay loam, on a convex, south facing, 14 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,578 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 30 percent indurated channers.

    A--0 to 8 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) channery sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4), moist; 23 percent clay; weak fine granular structure; very friable, slightly hard; few coarse and medium, common fine and very fine roots; 30 percent channers; slightly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated in matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 cm thick)

    C--8 to 23 cm; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist; 25 percent clay; massive; friable, slightly hard; few coarse and medium, common fine and very fine roots; few fine gypsum crystals; 10 percent channers; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated in matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary.

    Cy--23 to 28 cm; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4), moist; 20 percent clay; massive; friable, slightly hard; common coarse, medium, fine and very fine roots; common fine gypsum crystals; 20 percent channers; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated in matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (The combined thickness of the C and Cy horizons is 20 to 36 cm)

    Cr--28  to 53 cm; weathered bedrock, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4), moist; few very fine roots.

TYPE LOCATION:  Emery County, Utah; about 63 kilometers (39.5 miles) southeast of Castle Dale; located about 700 feet east and 1,600 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 33, T. 20 S., R. 12 E., Salt Lake meridian; Devils Hole USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 2 minutes 21.8 seconds N. and long. 110 degrees 34 minutes 44.4 seconds W., NAD83

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Klondike and Kinusta series.  Klondike soils have mean annual temperatures of 8.9 to 12.8 degrees C.  Kinusta soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium, colluvium and or eolian sands over residuum derived from interbedded calcareous and gypsiferous sedimentary rocks, dominantly sandstone and shale.
Landform:  hills and escarpments
Slopes:  5 to 60 percent
Elevation:  1,585 to 2,195 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 10 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  23 to 31 cm
Precipitation pattern:  Precipitation peaks from July to October and falls evenly throughout the remainder of the year.
Frost-free period:  120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Humbug, Mussentuchit, Rizno and Skos series.  The Humbug and Mussentuchit soils have gypsic horizons and developed in residuum from gypsiferous shale.  The Rizno soils have a lithic contact and developed in residuum from sandstone.  The Skos soils are loamy-skeletal, have a lithic contact and developed in residuum from sandstone.  These soils are intermingled with Sinbad soils on eroded hills and escarpments of thinly interbedded sedimentary rocks.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, very high runoff, moderately slow permeability, nonflooded.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is shadscale, Mormon-tea, Utah juniper, Indian ricegrass, galleta and salina wildrye.  Utah ecological site R034XY233UT, Semidesert Shallow Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Emery County, Utah; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent; about 2,355 hectares (5,820 acres) mapped in Emery County.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery Area, Utah, 2011 Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand and Sevier Counties soil survey area.  The name refers to Sinbad Country, a large geographic region of deeply dissected and uplifted sedimentary rock formations in central Emery County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 28 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 0 to 28 cm.  (A and C horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 8 cm.  (A horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered bedrock at 28 cm.  (Cr horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
