MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pendleton County, West Virginia, 1988. 

REMARKS: The name is from a community in Pendleton County. This soil was formerly included in the Cookport series.

The 2017 revision reclassifies the series from Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Typic 
Fragiudepts to Coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, frigid Aquic Fragiorthods and re-defines the parent material concept from residuum to colluvium.  These revisions are based on field projects conducted during 2014 through 2017 and laboratory analysis of two sampled pedons.  The typical pedon was relocated but occurs in the same map unit delineation as the original typical pedon.  The particle-size class is border-line fine-loamy/coarse-loamy.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (Oi, Oe, A, E horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 10 to 28 cm (4 to 11 inches) (E horizon)
Spodic horizon--the zone from 28 to 51 cm (11 to 21 inches) (Bs horizon)
Fragipan--the zone from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) (2Bx1, 2Bx2  horizons)
Aquic conditions-the zone from 51 to 165 cm (20 to 65 inches) (2Bx1, 2Bx2, 3C horizons)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Lithologic discontinuity--at the upper boundary of the 2Bx1 horizon at 51 cm (20 inches).
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm (0 to 59 inches)
Lithic contact--the contact at 165 cm (65 inches)

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL characterization data is available for pedons S2015WV071001 and S2015WV083001.
