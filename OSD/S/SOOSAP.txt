REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 3 to 91 cm
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 3 to 91 cm (upper 30 cm averages less than 6 percent organic carbon)
*Andic soil properties--zone from 3 to 91 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from 3 to 91 cm
*Depth to paralithic contact--91 cm
*Paralithic materials--91 to 114 cm
*Depth to lithic contact--114 cm

09/2023-- all mineral horizons meet criteria #3 for andic soil properties in the 13th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. All pedons have third-bar bulk density low enough to also meet criteria #2 (no ash required) throughout the umbric epipedon, and some pedons meet criteria #2 throughout the profile.

09/2004--this draft represents a change in classification from Medial Andic Cryumbrepts to Medial, amorphic Typic Haplocryands based on the Andisol Order
