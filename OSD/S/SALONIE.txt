DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: moderately well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high in the Oe horizon, moderately high to high in the A horizon, and very high in the 2C horizons.
Permeability: rapid to very rapid in the Oe horizon, moderate to rapid in the A horizon and rapid to very rapid in the 2C horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Used principally as grazing land.  Native grasses are cut in places for hay and silage, and there are a few gardens and seeded hay fields.  The native vegetation is tall grass, dominated by bluejoint reedgrass, and associated plants such as fireweed.  In places, the soil supportsd stands of cottonwood and willows.
