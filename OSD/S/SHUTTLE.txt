SHUTTLE SERIES

The Shuttle series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Shuttle soils are on fan skirts.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Duric Haplocalcids

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shuttle soils are on fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,620 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jericho and Wiffo soils.  Jericho soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to indurated duripans with overlying calcic horizons, and have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.  Wiffo soils are loamy-skeletal, have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Shuttle soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly winterfat, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 5,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Elko County (Northeast Part), Nevada, 1986.

REMARKS:  The revision of 2/2000 eliminates the Very Deep depth class and recognizes the presence of a calcic horizon.  The phase of Shuttle which lacks duripans within 150 cm needs correlation to another series in the subgroup of Durinodic Haplocalcids.  Total extent of this phase is about 1,700 acres.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1, A2 and part of the Bk horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from 15 to 114 cm (Bk, Bqk1, and Bqk2 horizons).
Duric feature - The zone from 48 to 114 cm (Bqk1 and Bqk2 horizons).
Duripan - The zone from 114 to 152 cm (Bqkm horizon).
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bqk1 horizon and parts of the Bk and Bqk2 horizons).
