COMPETING SERIES: This is the Imuruk series. Imuruk soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 36 degrees F. (2 degrees C.).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: hills, mountains, outwash plains, stream terraces, and fan terraces on alluvial fans
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly outwash or eolian over alluvium
Elevation: 2,546 to 3,507 feet (776 to 1,069 m)
Slope: 0 to 65 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 35 inches (564 to 894 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broxson, Geist, Skarland, Slana, and Turbellina soils. Broxson soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on floodplains and alluvial fans. Geist and Skarland soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, and occur on hills and outwash plains. Slana soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on hills. Turbellina soils are very poorly drained, shallow to moderately deep to permafrost, and occur on hills and outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, low to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loess mantle and high to very high in the gravelly outwash.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is shrub birch-dwarf ericaceous scrub mosaic.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
