SKAGGS SERIES

The Skaggs series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone, limy shale, or calcareous sandstone. These soils are on hills. Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Calcic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Skaggs loam, in native grass (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 4 inches, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; few limestone fragments; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 A2--4 to 10 inches, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) heavy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; 10 percent limestone fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Bk1--10 to 21 inches, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; 10 percent limestone cobbles; 30 percent limestone gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Bk2--21 to 32 inches, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very stony clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; 20 percent stones; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. 

 R--32 inches, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) interbedded limestone and shale, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

Slopes: 2 to 75 percent
Parent material: colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone, limy shale, or calcareous sandstone
Climate: cool subhumid
Mean annual temperature: 37 to 45 degrees F
Mean summer temperature: 55 to 58 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 18 to 24 inches
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Skaggs soils are used mainly for range, but some areas are used for dryland farming. The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Richardsons needlegrass, mountain brome, Idaho fescue, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Skaggs soils are of moderate extent on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Montana and Wyoming; MLRA 44B, 43B, and 46.
