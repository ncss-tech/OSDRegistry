SPOKANE SERIES

The Spokane series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss and schist mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Spokane soils are on hills, mountains and ridgetops. Slopes are of 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Centralpeak, Donavan, Dragoon, Green Bluff, Mobate, Micapeak, Raisio, Skanid, and Tekoa soils. Centralpeak soils have an ochric epipedon, are frigid and are on side slopes of mountains. Donavan soils are more than 100 cm deep and are on side slopes of hills and mountains. Mobate and Skanid soils are 25 to 50 cm deep and are on mountains. Dragoon and Tekoa soils have an argillic horizon with more than 18 percent clay and are on mountains. Green Bluff soils have an ochric epipedon, are more than 100 cm deep and are on basalt plateaus. Micapeak soils are frigid, have an ochric epipedon and are on side slopes of mountains and foothills. Raisio soils are loamy-skeletal and are on south-facing side slopes of mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rural home sites, grazeable woodland, livestock grazing, timber production, wildlife habitat, and some dryland cropland. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine and scattered Douglas-fir, with an understory of common snowberry, snowbrush ceanothus, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, baldhip rose, and pinegrass. Native vegetation on dry sites is ponderosa pine with an understory of Idaho fescue and antelope bitterbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington and northern Idaho; MLRA 43A. Series is moderately extensive.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data available for Soil Survey Sample Numbers: 83WA019001 Ferry County, WA., NSSL Pedon Number: 84P0164, 96WA065001 Stevens County, WA.,  NSSL Pedon Number: 96P0073, 99WA0639005 Spokane County, WA. NSSL Pedon Number: 00P0798, 

Spokane soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).
