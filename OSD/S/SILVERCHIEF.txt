SILVERCHIEF SERIES 

The Silverchief series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Silverchief loam, woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--3 to 2 inches; organic mat of needles, leaves, and twigs. 

    Oe--2 inches to 0; humus layer. 

    E--0 to 5 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine and very fine pores; many unstained silt and sand grains on surface of peds; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bt1--5 to 20 inches; light olive brown (2.5YR 5/4) silty clay, olive brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 10 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; olive brown (2.5YR 4/4) strains on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--20 to 27 inches; light olive brown (2.5YR 5/4) gravelly silty clay, olive brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 20 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; continuous thin coats of lime on underside of smaller pebbles, continuous faint crusts of lime on undersides of larger cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual clear boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 17 to 30 inches.) 

    Bk--27 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots in upper part grading to few very fine and medium roots in the lower part; common fine pores; 35 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles; disseminated lime, continuous distinct coating of lime on surface of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - mountains; hills. 

Elevation - 4,000 to 6,400 feet. 

Slope - 8 to 60 percent. 

Parent material - colluvium and alluvium from mixed rock sources containing carbonates. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 17 to 25 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Silverchief soils are used mainly for the production of forest products, summer grazing of livestock, and for grazing by wildlife.  Potential navive vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, Douglas fir, and aspen with an understory of rose, snowberry, common chokecherry, russet buffaloberry, and oregongrape. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Silverchief soils are of small extent in the mountains of central and southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Blaine County, Montana, 1976. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0279.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 5 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 5 to 27 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section from the top of the argillic horizon to a depth of 20 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a horizon of accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate from 27 to 60 inches (Bk horizon).  Silverchief soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
