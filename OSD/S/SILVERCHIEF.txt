SILVERCHIEF SERIES 

The Silverchief series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Silverchief loam, woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; organic mat of needles, leaves, and twigs. 

    Oe--3 to 8 cm; humus layer. 

    E--8 to 21 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine and very fine pores; many unstained silt and sand grains on surface of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick) 

    Bt1--21 to 59 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) silty clay, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) strains on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--59 to 77 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) gravelly silty clay, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; continuous thin coats of lime on underside of smaller gravel, continuous faint crusts of lime on undersides of larger cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual clear boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 43 to 76 cm.) 

    Bk--77 to 161 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots in upper part grading to few very fine and medium roots in the lower part; common fine pores; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; disseminated lime, continuous distinct coating of lime on surface of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

Elevation--1225 to 1950 meters
Slope--8 to 60 percent
Parent material--colluvium and alluvium from mixed rock sources containing carbonates
Climate--long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation--430 to 640 mm
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 6 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Silverchief soils are used mainly for the production of forest products, summer grazing of livestock, and for grazing by wildlife.  Potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, and aspen with an understory of rose, snowberry, common chokecherry, russet buffaloberry, and mahonia. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Silverchief soils are of small extent in the mountains of central and southwestern Montana; MLRAs 43B and 46.
