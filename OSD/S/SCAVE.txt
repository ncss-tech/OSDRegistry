SCAVE SERIES

The Scave series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and/or colluvium derived mainly from sandstone with some quartzite, limestone and shale. These soils are on moderately steep to very steep mountain slopes. Slopes are 6 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Abruptic Palecryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Scave silt loam - native aspen, grasses and forbs.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 5 cm; Matted decaying leaves and twigs.

   A1--5 to 30 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many large and medium roots; few fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 41 cm thick)

   A2--30 to 45 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) and brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many large, medium, and small roots; few fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

   E--45 to 91 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium and small roots, many medium and fine interstitial pores; 30 to 40 percent cobbles and gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); abrupt wavy boundary. (25 to 61 cm thick)

   Bt1--91 to 121 cm; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) very cobbly clay; red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; many medium and fine tubular pores; moderately thick continuous clay films; 60 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); few fine black concretions and stains; gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 50 cm thick)

   Bt2--121 to 146 cm; same as Bt1 horizon but with 80 to 90 percent cobbles and a few stones. (Not sampled.)

TYPE LOCATION: Cache County, Utah; about 2 km south and 3 km west of Anderson Range headquarters; about 305 meters north of the center of sec. 9, T.9N., R.3E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture--The soils are moist for 55 to 65 percent of the time and are dry in parts of the 10 to 30 cm depth for 60 to 75 days during the late summer or early autumn.
Mean annual soil temperature--3 to 7 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature--11 to 14 degrees C
Mollic epipedon thickness--25 to 40 cm
Combined thickness of A, E and Bt horizons--150 to 190 cm or more
Abruptic feature--There is an abrupt texture change between the E horizon and the Bt1 horizon at depths of 60 to 115 cm, where the clay content increases more than 20 percent within a vertical distance of less than 8 cm.
Rock fragment content--5 to 20 percent in the A horizons, 30 to 70 percent in the E horizon, 35 to 70 percent in the Bt1 horizon, and 70 to 90 percent in the lower part of the Bt2 horizon; mainly cobble- and stone-size angular sandstone and rounded quartzite rock fragments.

A horizons

Value--2 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma--2 or 3
Structure--weak to moderate, fine to medium granular structure or weak subangular blocky structure in the lower part
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 7.3

E horizon
Hue--10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR
Value--5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma--2 through 4
Texture--cobbly loam or very cobbly loam to gravelly fine sandy loam
Structure--weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure
Reaction--pH 5.1 to 6.5

Bt horizons
Hue--5YR or 2.5YR
Value--5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma--4 through 8
Texture--very cobbly or very gravelly clay or very cobbly heavy clay loam
Clay content--35 percent
Clay films--few to continuous, thin or moderately thick clay films on peds and in pores
Structure--weak to strong, medium to coarse prismatic structure that parts to blocky
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 7.3

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cluff, Flygare, Lucky Star, Pritchett, Red Spur and Roundy series. Cluff soils lack mollic epipedons. Flygare and Red Spur soils have mollic epipedons more than 40 cm thick and have cobbly sandy clay loam argillic horizons with less than 35 percent clay. Lucky Star soils have albic horizons that tongue into very cobbly sandy clay loam argillic horizons. Pritchett soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Roundy soils have mollic epipedons more than 40 cm thick and have argillic horizons of cobbly clay containing less than 35 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--moderately steep to very steep mountain slopes
Elevations--1890 to 2805 meters
Slope--6 to 50 percent
Parent material--sandstone with some quartzite, limestone and shale
Climate--moist subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters
Mean annual precipitation--510 to 890 mm
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 7 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--12 to 14 degrees C
Frost free period--80 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for watershed and rangeland for grazing of livestock and wildlife. The native vegetation is aspen with widely spaced Douglas-fir and subalpine fir, understory of snowberry, mountain bromegrass, blue wildrye, oniongrass, slender wheatgrass, peavine, horsemint, geranium and anise.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Scave soils are of small extent in the high mountain areas of northern Utah; MLRAs 28A and 47.
