SPOKEL SERIES

The Spokel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  Spokel soils are on canyon slopes and have gradients of 40 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Spokel very gravelly loam, woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0i--0 to 1 inch; fresh and partially decomposed needles and twigs; neutral (pH 6.6).

    0e--1 to 2 inches; well decomposed organic litter; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

    A1--2 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--5 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw1--12 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 70 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw2--22 to 40 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; 70 percent gravel and 5 percent cobblestones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C--40 to 64 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 75 percent gravel and 5 percent cobblestones; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Idaho County, Idaho; about 2 miles south of White Bird; about 850 feet west and 1,450 feet south of the northeast corner of section 28, T.27N., R.1E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments make up about 35 to 70 percent of the 0 to 40 inch layer.  The soils are usually moist but the 4 to 10 inch layer is dry for 45 to 65 days in late summer and early fall.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 51 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.

The A horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is 8 to 16 inches thick.

The Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam or loam and has less than 18 percent clay.

The C horizon is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam or sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bald, Briedwell, Burnscreek, Fivelakes, Huston, Lyville, Mowako, Rockford, and Suta series. Bald and Mowako soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Briedwell and Rockford soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Burnscreek soils are dry 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice and receive 18 to 24 inches of precipitation. Fivelakes soils are dry 90 to 105 days following the summer solstice and have sandy-skeletal material at 20 to 36 inches. Huston soils are dry 60 to 90 days following the summer solstice and have stratified C horizons. Lyville and Suta soils are deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spokel soils are on canyon slopes and have gradients of 40 to 90 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rock.  Elevations are 2,800 to 4,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 24 to 26 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brower and Nazaton soils.  Brower soils have more than 75 percent base saturation throughout the upper 30 inches.  Nazaton soils are pachic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for woodland and grazing.  Vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, snowberry and various forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Inextensive in northern Idaho and possibly eastern Oregon and Washington.
