SKEEL SERIES

The Skeel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid, ortstein Alfic Oxyaquic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Skeel loamy sand, on a south-facing, convex, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 204 meters (670 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise indicated. When described on July 7, 1994 the profile was dry to 76 cm (30 inches) and moist below.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Skeel soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Skeel soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 130 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Algonquin, Iargo, Mongo, and Negwegon series. All of these soils are clayey throughout the particle-size control section, and do not have spodic horizons. The somewhat poorly drained Algonquin soils are on slightly lower landscape positions. The Iargo soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The Negwegon soils are on side slopes along minor drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy mantle and moderately high in the underlying loamy material. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow in the underlying loamy material. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 inches) between October and May in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cropland. Principal crops are corn and hay. Some areas are used for pasture land. A few areas are used for woodland. Native vegetation includes bigtooth aspen, paper birch, white oak, red maple, bracken fern, and wintergreen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northeastern lower peninsula of Michigan. This series is of small extent.
