SIPPLE SERIES

The Sipple series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium. These soils are on terraces and fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Absarook, Archmesa, Beartooth, Beeno, Bielenberg, Bookcliff, Burtoner, Clancy, Clasoil, Dooley, Doughty, Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Farside, Felor, Greenway, Gurney, Hangdo, Hoppers, Hyalite, Jeffcity, Kokoruda, Livona, Martinsdale, Maudlin, Meagher, Moen, Moento, Pianohill, Placerton, Reeder, Reedwest, Snakejohn, Sponseller, Trag, Tragmon, Trazuni, Trujillo, Ulrant, Vida, Watne, Watrous, Williams, and Yegen series. The Absarook, Archmesa, Burtoner, Gurney, Hoppers, Jeffcity, Maudlin, Moen, Moento, Pianohill and Watrous soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Beartooth soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the Bk horizons. The Beeno, Reeder, and Reedwest soils are moderately deep to a paralithc contact. The Bielenberg, Bookcliff, Clancy, Placerton, Snakejohn, and Ulrant soils are deep to a lithic contact. The Clasoil, Farside, Hangdo, Hyalite, Kokoruda, Sponseller, Trag, Tragmon, and Trazuni soils do not have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. The Dooley, Doughty, Felor, Livona, and Meagher soils are moderately deep to a lithologic discontinuity. The Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Martinsdale, Trujillo, Vida, Watne, Williams, and Yegen soils do not have lithologic discontinuities. The Greenway soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 15 to 25 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sipple soils are on terraces and fans. Elevations are 4,000 to 4,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium. The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and summers. Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 22 inches. Mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F. The growing season is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Doughty, Judith, and Windham series. Judith and Windham soils lack argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Sipple soils are used mainly as cropland. Small areas are used for pasture and as rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, and bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Montana. The series is of limited extent.
