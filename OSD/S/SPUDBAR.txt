SPUDBAR SERIES

The Spudbar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from mixed rock sources. These soils are on cuestas, hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Spudbar very cobbly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; many distinct calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments and common irregular fine masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--18 to 22 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; many distinct calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments and common irregular masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 17 inches thick)

    R--22 to 60 inches; slightly weathered igneous rock.
