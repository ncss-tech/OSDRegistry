SWEETHOLLOW SERIES

The Sweethollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone.  Sweethollow soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sweethollow very cobbly loam, on a southwest facing, 25 percent slope in forest at an elevation of 2,205 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 5 percent stones.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dranyon, Ezbin, and Game(T)(ID) series.  The Dranyon soils have a fine-loamy particle size class and are in concave swales.  The Ezbin soils have an argillic horizon and are on linear positions.  The Game soils have an argillic horion and are on north facing slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high runoff, moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are wood products, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native plant community is Douglas-fir and aspen with an understory of mountain snowberry, sticky geranium and pinegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Sweethollow soils are of small extent in southeastern Idaho and western Wyoming; MLRA 43B.
