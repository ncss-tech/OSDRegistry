SIMPSON SERIES

Simpson series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan remnants. These soils formed in volcanic ashand alluvium superimposed lacustrine material, both of which were derived mainly from tuffs, basalts and andesites. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 millimeters (14 inches), most of which comes in the form of snow. The mean annual air temperature is about 9.0 degrees C. (48 degrees F.).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashone (NV), Bidwell, Coppersmith (CA) and Ponyspring (NV) series. Ashone soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Bidwell soils have a mollic epipedon 25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches) thick.  Coppersmith soils have 20 to 41 centimeter (8 to 16 inch) thick mollic epipedons and 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section. Ponyspring soils have 25 to 36 centimeter (10 to 14 inch) thick mollic epipedons and 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Simpson soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ashand alluvium superimposed over very gravelly ashy sandy lacustrine material, both of which were derived mainly from tuffs, basalts and andesites. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,542 meters (4,200 to 5,060 feet). The climate is cool, continental with mean annual precipitation of 305 to 406 millimeters (12 to 16 inches), most of which comes in the form of snow. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.5 to 11.0 degrees C. (46 to 52 degrees F.); frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bidwell, Buntingville, Donica and Surprise soils. Bidwell soils have 18 to 35 percent clay and do not have 2C horizons with 50 to 80 percent rock fragments. Buntingville soils are somewhat poorly drained, and have 20 to 35 percent clay and do not have 2C horizons with 50 to 80 percent rock fragments. Donica soils have ashy-skeletal control sections. Surprise soils do not have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; surface runoff is slow; permeability is slow; saturated hydraulic conductivity class is moderately low.

USE AND VEGETATION: Areas of these soils are used for production of dryland small grains and pasture, and irrigated alfalfa in rotation with small grains and pasture. They are also used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation consists mainly of big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush and bluebunch wheatgrass, and scattered juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils occur in northeastern California. These soils are of limited extent. MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, Modoc and Lassen Counties, California, and Washoe County, Nevada, 1957. Simpson was derived from Simpson Creek in Surprise Valley, California.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly classified as Chestnut soils. 
The series is reclassified in 2006 based on the optical grain count of associated soils. It was previously classified as Fine, smectitic, mesic Pachic Argixerolls.
