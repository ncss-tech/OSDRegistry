The Spyglass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian and lacustrine material derived from sandstone, shale, and gypsum. Spyglass soils are on floodplain steps of basin floors . Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. A similar soil is the Cielito series. Cielito soils are fine-loamy, have gypsic mineralogy, and are deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Spyglass soils are on floodplain steps of basin floors . They formed in eolian, alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sandstone, shale, and gypsum. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arojomil, Hyer, and Trofes soils. Arojomil soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, do not have secondary gypsum, and occur on undulating plains and plateaus.  Hyer soils are fine-silty, do not have secondary gypsum, and occur on undulating plains. Trofes soils have gypsic horizons below forty inches and occur on low stream terraces of basin floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is slow 

USE AND VEGETATION: Spyglass soils are used for livestock grazing, and irrigated farming. Present vegetation is alkali sacaton and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Spyglass soils are of small extent on the Estancia Basin of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 70.
