4/2017--The Scatter series was established as part of an update project. The official series description was developed according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation and laboratory sampling in the flood plains of MLRA 2 is recommended to determine the distribution and influence of volcanic ash.
