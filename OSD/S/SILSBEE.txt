SILSBEE SERIES

The Silsbee series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These gently sloping to strongly soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 3 to 12 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kirbyville and Otanya soils.  Kirbyville soils are moderately well drained and are on lower landscape positions.  Otanya soils have a subsoil yellower than 5YR and are on similar to lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Silsbee soils are well drained.  Runoff is medium on 3 to 5 percent, and high on 5 to 12 percent slopes.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for woodland and wildlife habitat. Some areas are used for pastureland. Pastures are bahiagrass and improved bermudagrass. Native vegetation is longleaf pine, yaupon, bluestems, panicums and paspalums.  The most common commercially grown pine is loblolly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas generally east of the Trinity River; LRR T; MLRA 152B (Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods). The series is of moderate extent.
