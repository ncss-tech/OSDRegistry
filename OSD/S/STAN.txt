STAN SERIES

The Stan series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terraces and alluvial fans. They formed in moderately coarse alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rocks. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calcixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Stan fine sandy loam, cultivated. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Ap--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; very weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

  A--8 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; very weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick) 

  Bw--16 to 29 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 14 inches thick) 

  Bk1--29 to 38 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent hard nodules or cicada krotovinas; strongly effervescent, common fine veins, spots, and splotches of calcium carbonate; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick) 

  Bk2--38 to 50 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, common veins and coatings of calcium carbonate; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick) 

  2Bk3--50 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent, gravel fragments coated with calcium carbonate on lower side and partially coated on upper side; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Beartrap series. Beartrap soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are on alluvial fans at elevations of 4,200 to 5,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soil formed in alluvium that is dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources, but contains some rhylitic, basaltic, and granitic materials. In places, the upper part may be loess. The climate is semiarid with dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches including 2 to 5 feet of snowfall. The frost free season is 80 to 125 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bannock, Bock and Sasser soils. Bannock and Sasser soils have sand and gravel at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Bock soils are medium textured and are not calcareous to the surface. All of these soils are on similar positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cultivated under irrigation for hay, pasture, potatoes, and small grains. The principal native plants are big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, cheatgrass, and squirreltail. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Moderately extensive in the Upper Snake River Valley of Idaho.
