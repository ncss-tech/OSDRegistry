SWEETCREEK SERIES

The Sweetcreek series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils formed in alluvium from sandstone. These soils are on north-facing concave slopes on hills, ridges and plateaus. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryalfs

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boundridge (T), Cokeville (T), Pontuge (T), and Slan (T) series.  Boundridge soils are shallow to a duripan on summits and ridgetops.  Cokeville soils are 40 to 60 inches to weathered sandstone and have a frigid soil temperature regime on all aspects except north-facing slopes.  Pontuge soils are very deep and have a mollic epipedon on hillsides and mountainsides.  Slan soils have a frigid soil temperature regime on lower mountainsides and hillsides
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetative is mountain big sagebrush, Eriogonum, Nevada bluegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, mountain snowberry, and pine bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are moderately extensive in southeastern Idaho.  MLRA 43B.
