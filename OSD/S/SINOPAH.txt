SINOPAH SERIES

The Sinopah series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in decomposed herbaceous plant material and layered volcanic ash. Sinopah soils are on fens within glacial-valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic Fluvaquentic Cryosaprists 

TYPICAL PEDON: Sinopah mucky peat in a fen with a 2 percent slope, at an elevation of 1,114 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oe--0 to 36 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky peat, very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) dry; 60 percent fibers, 25 percent rubbed; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  

 Oa--36 to 77 cm; black (10YR 2/1) muck, very dark gray (10YR3/1) dry; 20 percent fibers, 5 percent rubbed; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

 C--77 to 94 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) ashy silt loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) dry; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

 O'a--94 to 127 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) muck, very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) dry; 10 percent fibers, 5 percent rubbed; very sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

 Cg1--127 to 136 cm; greenish gray (10Y 6/1) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; massive; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

 Cg2--136 to 150 cm; gray (N 6/) silt loam, light gray (N 7/) dry; massive; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Flathead County, Montana; located about 5 meters north and 100 meters west of the southeast corner of sec. 18, T. 33N., R. 19W; Camas Ridge West topographic quadrangle; UTM Zone 12, 272721e, 5390368n. NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature: 3.0 to 6.5 degrees C.
Histic epipedon: 60 to 100 cm thick
Depth to volcanic ash and/or other mineral layers: 60 to 100 cm; thickness of the various mineral strata within the first 100 cm is 15 to 30 cm
Depth to a seasonally high water table: 0 to 15 cm; water may be ponded in the spring and early summer.

Note: Occasionally a saturated Oi horizon (10 cm or less thick) is found at the surface with slightly decomposed mosses and fibers. Organic layers are mostly highly decomposed mosses and sedges. Wood fragment content is typically less than 5 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: fens within glacial-valley floors 
Elevation: 1,000 to 1,300 meters 
Slope: 0 to 2 percent 
Parent material: decomposed herbaceous plant material and layered volcanic ash 
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; short warm summers with May and June receiving the most precipitation 
Mean annual precipitation: 640 to 900 mm 
Mean annual air temperature: 2.0 to 6.0 degrees C. 
Frost-free period: 45 to 70 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained and 5.0 to 50 um/sec. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are in organic wet meadows that are used mainly for wildlife. They are saturated much of the year and covered with a blanket of mosses. The herbaceous vegetation is dominated by woollyfruit sedge, Northwest Territory sedge, Nebraska sedge, and minor amounts of purple marshlocks and marsh skullcap. Shrub species such as willows, bog birch, and western Labrador tea are sometimes found near the perimeter of these meadows. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sinopah soils are of limited extent in northern Montana. MLRA 43A and 43B.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana. 

SERIES PROPOSED: Flathead County, Montana. This soil is named for a mountain in Glacier National Park.
