SKYUTE SERIES

The Skyute series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from andesite.  Skyute soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Skyute loam, on a southwest facing, planar, 8 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,560 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on October 5, 1999, the soil was moist from 0 to 43 cm.

    A1--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  

    A2--5 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 horizons - 10 to 30 cm)

    Bt1--23 to 33 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; many fine, few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt2--33 to 43 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 14 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  

    R--43 to 69 cm; andesite bedrock

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mesas
Elevation - 2,450 to 2,625 meters
Slopes - 1 to 20 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium over residuum derived from andesite
Mean annual air temperature - 5.5 to 7.2 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation - 400 to 510 mm
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of November through March and July through October.  June is the driest month.  Total snowfall averages about 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet) with snowmelt lasting into April.
Frost-free period - 80 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are commercial woodlands and wildlife habitat.  The native plant community is ponderosa pine, Gambel's oak, snowberry, nodding brome, Arizona fescue, and mountain muhly.  Some quaking aspen occurs at higher elevations and in drainageways.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Colorado and northwestern New Mexico; LRR D, E; MLRA 36, 48A; minor extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jicarilla Apache Area, New Mexico, 2000. The series was proposed in Archuleta County, Colorado, Archuleta County Area Soil Survey. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
