SLAGAMELT SERIES

The Slagamelt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash and slide deposits derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on outwash plains, outwash fans, stream terraces, fan remnants, drainageways and landslides. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Aquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Slagamelt cobbly silt loam, in aspen grove (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--1 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) cobbly silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; few prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry relict mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; few very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw1--7 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 25 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--16 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bw1, Bw2 horizons - 15 to 25 inches)

    C--27 to 34 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; common prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry redox concentrations; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    2C--34 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; many prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry redox concentrations; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES: 
Becks (CO) - are slightly or moderately alkaline throughout
Corralval (CA) - have a xeric soil moisture regime
Wishard (MT) - have an udic soil moisture regime

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - outwash plains, outwash fans, stream terraces, fan remnants, drainageways and landslides
Elevation - 6,000 to 8,000 feet 
Slope - 0 to 15 percent 
Parent material - alluvium, outwash and slide deposits derived from mixed sources
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 20 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Shewag and Redfish soils.  The Shewag soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to sand and gravel and are in more convex positions. The Redfish soils are very poorly drained and are in more concave positions.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability above the 2C horizon and rapid in the 2C horizon. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Slagamelt soils are used for pasture and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly quaking aspen, tufted hairgrass and forbs.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Slagamelt soils are not extensive in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.
