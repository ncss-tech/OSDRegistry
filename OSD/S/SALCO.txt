SALCO SERIES

The Salco series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These gently and moderately sloping soils formed in loamy, calcareous alluvium over residuum weathered from tuffaceous sandstone bedrock of Miocene age. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in).
