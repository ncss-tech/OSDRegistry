SUCHES SERIES

The Suches series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils on nearly level flood plains along creeks and rivers in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). They formed in loamy alluvial sediments washed largely from soils formed in residuum from granite, gneiss, schist, phyllite, and other metamorphic and crystalline rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Fluventic Dystrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Suches loam--pasture. (Colors are for moist soil.) 

 Ap--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium granular structure; friable; common fine and very fine roots; common fine pores; common fine flakes of mica; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

 Bw1--10 to 18 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and very fine roots; few fine pores; common fine flakes of mica; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bw2--18 to 36 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay loam; many fine distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and very fine roots; few fine pores; common fine flakes of mica; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw3--36 to 44 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium granular structure; very friable; few fine and very fine roots; many fine flakes of mica; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the B horizon is 34 to 54 inches)

 C--44 to 60 inches; mottled light gray (10YR 7/2), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy sand; single grained; loose; many fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Fannin County, Georgia; 6 miles west of Fannin-Union County line on Old U.S. Highway 76; north on secondary road to Hemptown Creek Bridge; east 1,250 feet along stream channel; south 520 feet from stream. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Flakes of mica range from few to many in all horizons. Gravel size rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the C and Cg horizons. 

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Few or common brownish or yellowish mottles occur in some pedons. It is loam or fine sandy loam. 

The upper part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. Mottles in shades of brown and yellow are none to common. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Few to many, brownish mottles are in the upper part of the B horizon of some pedons and in the lower part of most pedons. Some pedons contain mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part of this horizon, at depths greater than 24 inches below the surface. 

The lower part of the B horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6. There are few to many mottles in shades of red, brown and gray. It is sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. 

The Bg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of red, yellow, brown and gray. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. 

The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. There are common to many mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray or it is mottled in the same colors. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, clay loam or their gravelly analogues. 

The Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2. There are common or many mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, clay loam or their gravelly analogues. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bermudian, Clifty, Rowdy, and Spargus series of the same family and the Arkaqua, French, Greendale and Tate series of closely related families. Arkaqua and French soils are poorer drained. Bermudian, Clifty, Rowdy, and Spargus soils lack mica flakes in the profile. Greendale soils have siliceous mineralogy. Tate soils have an argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Suches soils are on nearly level flood plains along creeks and rivers in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). They formed in loamy alluvial sediments washed largely from soils formed in residuum from granite, gneiss, schist, phyllite, and other metamorphic and crystalline rocks. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. The elevation is 1500 to 3000 feet. Mean annual precipitation is about 50 to 75 inches and evenly distributed throughout the year. Mean annual temperature is about 50 to 59 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Arkaqua, French and Tate series and the Chatuge, Dillard, Rosman, Toxaway and Transylvania series. Chatuge soils are poorly drained. Dillard soils are on slightly higher landscapes and have an argillic horizon. Rosman soils are sandier throughout. Toxaway and Transylvania soils have an umbric epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained or moderately well drained. Runoff is slow and permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of acreage is used for pasture, corn, and truck crops. The native trees are mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Blue Ridge (MLRA 130) of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and possibly South Carolina. The series is not extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 10 inches (Ap horizon.)
