COMPETING SERIES: This is the Starlake series. Starlake soils are dry for longer periods in the moisture control section, and may be reclassified into a typic aridic moisture regime.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sena soils are on flood plain steps of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation is 5,400 to 6,600 feet. Mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Galisteo and Zia soils. Galisteo soils do not have a natric horizon and occur on low stream terraces. Zia soils are coarse textured and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium to high runoff, and very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The Sena soils are used for livestock grazing. The historic climax vegetation is alkali sacaton, blue grama, fourwing saltbush, and galleta.  The ecological site is Salt Flats (R036XB126NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sena soils are of small extent on the northern Galisteo Basin part of the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
