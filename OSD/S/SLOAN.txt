SLOAN SERIES

The Sloan series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Sloan silty clay loam, on a slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field at an elevation of 274 meters (900 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) rubbed, and gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 28 cm (6 to 11 inches) thick)]

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ambraw, Gansner, Ozamis, Settlemeyer, and Toppenish series. Ambraw soils dominantly are more acidic than neutral in the cambic horizon. Gansner soils do not have a cambic horizon and have gleyed hues of 5G and 5GY in the lower part of the series control section. Ozamis soils have strata of ash within the series control section. Settlemeyer and Toppenish soils are calcareous in the upper part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sloan soils are on flood plains or in depressions along streams receiving sediment from areas of Wisconsinan age glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium washed mainly from soils formed in loamy, calcareous drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1041 mm (31 to 41 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 200 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eel, Genesee, Medway, Ross, and Shoals soils. The moderately well drained Eel, the well drained Genesee, and the somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils do not have mollic epipedons, and are nearer to stream channels or along more active streams. The moderately well drained Medway soils and well drained Ross soils are on higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. These soils are subject to flooding from late fall to spring. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high; in the sandy substratum phase, it is very high. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow. In the sandy substratum phase, permeability is rapid in the lower part of the series control section. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is artificially drained and cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops with small acreages of hay, oats, and vegetables. Other areas, especially on the flood plains of the smaller streams, are used for permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, chiefly elm, ash, sycamore, silver maple, and willow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Extensively in MLRAs 98, 99, 111A, and 111B, and less extensively in MLRAs 94A, 96, 97, 101, 108A, 111C, 111D, 111E, 114A, 114B, 115A, 116A, 139, 140, 142, 143, 144A, and 145 in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The type location is in MLRA 111B. The series is of large extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Logan County, Ohio, 1933.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (Ap, A horizons).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 86 cm (Bg horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in the lower part of the mollic and in all underlying horizons.

Sandy substratum and till substratum phases are recognized. A moderately deep to bedrock phase is also recognized. This phase will become a new series when areas are investigated and updated.

11/2011 Revision: minor formatting changes; updated terminology for redox features.
