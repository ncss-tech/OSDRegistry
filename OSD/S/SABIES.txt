SABIES SERIES

The Sabies series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Sabies soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy, calcareous, thermic Vitrandic Torriorthents

(6 to 12 inches thick)

    Ckn2--45 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) stratified very gravelly ashy sandy loam to ashy sand, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine interstitial pores; 0 to 45 percent pebbles; secondary carbonates segregated as few thin (<1 mm) coats on pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sabies soils are on stream terraces and fan remnants.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches some of which comes as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 80 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blindspring and Seaman soils.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately slow permeability.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sabies soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly black greasewood, shadscale, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central California in the Owens Valley.  These soils are not extensive with about 2,800 acres of the series mapped to date.   MLRA 29.
