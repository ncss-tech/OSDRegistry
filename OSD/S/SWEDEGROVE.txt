USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are artificially drained and cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. The native vegetation is is predominantly wet-site tall prairie species such as prairie cordgrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, wooly sedge, giant goldenrod and Canada goldenrod.

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 36 centimeters; Ap and Ak horizons);
calcic horizon--the zone from 36 to 152 centimeters (Bkg1 and Bkg2 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
