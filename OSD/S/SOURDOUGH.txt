SOURDOUGH SERIES

The Sourdough series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Sourdough loam, in hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; 5 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

    AB--8 to 12  inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots; 5 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 15  inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--15 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt3--26 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 13 to 28 inches).

    2C--36 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; 30 percent pebbles, 35 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; common distinct lime coatings on undersides of coarse fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1625.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 15 inches (A, AB,Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 12 to 36 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons); a litholgic discontinuity at 36 inches (2C horizon), a particle size control section from 12 to 32 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons). Sourdough soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.
