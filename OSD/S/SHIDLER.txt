SHIDLER SERIES

The Shidler series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable upland soils that formed in material weathered from limestone and chert of Permian and Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping convex uplands in the Bluestem Hills (MLRA 76). Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 91 centimeters (36 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shidler flaggy silty clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) flaggy silty clay loam; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine and medium granular structure; hard, friable; limestone fragments make up 30 percent by volume; slightly alkaline; abrupt irregular boundary.  (10 to 51 centimeters (4 to 20 inches thick)

  R--18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) hard fractured limestone; fractures are 5 mm wide and occur at intervals of about 60 cm; fractures contain soil material similar to the horizon above and extend to a depth of 46 cm.

TYPE LOCATION:  Osage County, Oklahoma; about 2 miles west and 1 mile south of Pawhuska; 183 meters (600 feet) south and 15 meters (50 feet) east of the northwest corner of sec. 18, T 25 N., R. 9 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum thickness: 10 to 51 centimeters (4 to 20 inches).
Mollic epipedon: 10 to 51 centimeters (4 to 20 inches)
Some pedons are calcareous and moderately alkaline just above the bedrock.
Particle size control section (weighted average):
Clay content:18 to 35 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: N to 3
Texture: silt loam, silty clay loam, flaggy silt loam, flaggy silty clay loam, stony silt loam, or stony silty clay loam.
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent
Fragments: 0 to 35 percent by volume of limestone or chert greater than 2mm fragments and 0 to 30 percent by volume less than 2 mm in diameter and 0 to 30 percent by volume greater than 76 mm in diameter
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

R horizon:
grayish or brownish limestone that is fractured vertically at intervals from 30 to 180 cm and the fractures range from 1 to 150 mm wide to a depth of 40 to 60 cm.  The bedrock has horizontal bedding planes from 5 to 122 cm apart, but commonly are 10 to 20 cm.  The bedrock is .6 meters to several meters thick.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: nearly level to sloping convex uplands in the Bluestem Hills
Slope: 0 to 8 percent
Parent material: material weathered from limestone and chert of Permian and Pennsylvania age.
Mean annual precipitation ranges from 86 to 96 centimeters (34 to 38 inches)
Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C (58 to 62 degrees F.)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 44 to 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Claremore series and Apperson, Catoosa, Clarita, Foraker, Grainola, Lula, Scullin and Westsum series.  Claremore soils occur on similar areas.
pperson, Foraker, Grainola, and Westsum soils have argillic horizons, a solum more than 20 inches thick, and more than 35 percent clay content in the control section.
Apperson soils occur on broad flats and Foraker, Grainola, and Summit soils occur on side slopes.
Catoosa, Lula and Scullin soils have argillic horizons, a solum more than 20 inches thick, and occur on similar areas.
Clarita soils have more than 35 percent clay content in the control section, cyclic properties, a solum more than 20 inches thick and occur on side slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Runoff: slow to rapid
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for range.
In some areas the bedrock is quarried and crushed into gravel and stone for roads, masonry or riprap.
Native vegetation is short and mid grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  In the Bluestem Hills (MLRA 76) of Oklahoma and Kansas.  The series is of moderate extent.
