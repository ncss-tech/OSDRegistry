SPERRY SERIES

The Sperry series consists of very deep, very poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are in slight depressions on broad upland divides and on treads of loess covered stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 43 to 93 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 203 centimeters (A, E, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and Btg5 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 centimeters (A horizon);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 43 centimeters (E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 200 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and Btg5 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Not all pedons meet the requirements for an abrupt textural change and classify as Argiaquic Argialbolls.
