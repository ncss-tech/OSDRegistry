COMPETING SERIES: None 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Lagoons and Estuaries 
Landform: Dredge-deposit shoal or spoil pile
Parent Material: Mixed sandy anthropogenic dredge deposits 
Slope: 0 to 1 percent 
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 10 to 14 degrees C. (50 to 57 degrees F.) 
Mean Annual Water Temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C. (52 to 58 degrees F.) 
Bathymetry: 0.2 to 1.5 meters  below mean sea level (0.5 to 5 feet)
Water Regime: Tidal, 0.3 to 1.5 meter tidal range (1.0 to 5.0 feet)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Demas soils (tentative)-are sandy throughout and are on washover-fan flats and slopes associated with storm surge events, formed on natural subaqueous landforms. 
Mantoloking soils (tentative)-are sandy throughout and are on inactive flood-tidal delta landforms, formed on natural subaqueous landforms.  
Cottman soils (tentative)-formed in lagoonal deposits which have a coarse-loamy particle size class and are on lagoon bottom barrier side landforms, formed on natural subaqueous landforms. 
Indian River soils (tentative)-are sandy throughout and are on active flood-tidal delta landforms, formed on natural subaqueous landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage Class: Subaqueous (permanently submersed) 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: High to Very High 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Most areas are vegetated and function as estuarine benthic wildlife habitat. Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops, oysters, and juvenile finfish are common. 
Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima). Vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 75 percent of the soil surface. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and possibly Virginia. This series is of small extent. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 2016.

REMARKS:
