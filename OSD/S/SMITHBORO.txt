MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Marion County, South Carolina; 1975

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 6 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 75 inches (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Smithboro soils were formerly mapped as Lenoir or Wahee. Both of these soils have mixed mineralogy. Laboratory data from Clemson University indicates kaolinitic mineralogy for the series.
