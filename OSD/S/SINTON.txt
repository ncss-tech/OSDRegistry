SINTON SERIES

The Sinton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level, flood plains of rivers and streams on the coastal plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Cumulic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Sinton sandy clay loam--rangeland; elevation is 30 m (100 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A1--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; common fine and medium roots; common fine pores; few worm casts; few fragments of snail shell; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary 

    A2--25 to 86 cm (10 to 34 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; few fine and medium roots; common fine and medium pores; common worm casts; few fragments of snail shell; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 51 to 104 cm [20 to 41 in]) 

    Bw1--86 to 127 cm (34 to 50 in); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; slightly sticky; few fine roots; few fine pores; few thin strata of loamy fine sand; few fragments of snail shell; few threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 102 to 152 cm [40 to 60 in]) 

    Bw2--127 to 203 cm (50 to 80 in); light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky; few fine roots; few fine pores; few threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline 

TYPE LOCATION: Jim Wells County, Texas; from the intersection of State Highway 359 and Farm Road 624 in Orange Grove; 3.4 miles north on State Highway 359 to intersection with Farm Road 534; 2.7 miles northwest on Farm Road 534; 150 ft southwest in rangeland on the south side of Pernitas Creek. Sandia, Texas USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 28 degrees 01 minutes 22.8 seconds N; Longitude: 97 degrees 56 minutes 27.1 seconds W.; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: A typic-ustic moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 90 days but less than 180 cumulative days in normal years. June through August and December through February are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May. 
Solum thickness ranges more than 152 cm (60 in) 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) 
Mean annual soil temperature: 22.2 to 23.4 degrees C (72 to 74 degrees F) 

Particle-size control section 
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent 

Thin strata of contrasting textures are at a depth of 61 to 127 cm (25 to 50 in). 

A Horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 3 or 4 
Chroma: 1 to 3 
Texture: loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam 
Effervescence: noneffervescent to slightly effervescent 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline 

Bw or Bk (where present) Horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 4 to 8 
Chroma: 1 to 6 
Texture: loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam, with thin discontinuous bedding planes and lenses of various textures 
Identifiable secondary carbonate: 0 to 3 percent, fine and medium, films and threads, throughout 
Effervescence: noneffervescent to slightly effervescent 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline 

Some pedons have stratified C horizons below 152 cm (60 in). 

COMPETING SERIES: 
These include the Degola (TX) series in the same family and the similar Bergstrom (TX), Bosque (TX), Laredo (TX), Odem (TX), and Ramadero series. 

Degola soils: have slightly acid to slightly alkaline A horizons and are non-calcareous. They have slightly shorter frost-free periods. 
Ramadero soils: are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods. 
Bergstrom and Bosque soils: have mean annual soil temperatures less than 22 degrees C (72 degrees F). 
Laredo and Bergstrom soils: have fine-silty control sections. 
Odem soils: have coarse-loamy control sections. 
Ramadero soils: have an active CEC class. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Quarternary age loamy alluvium from mixed sources 
Landscape: river valleys on coastal plains 
Landform: flood plains 
Slope: 0 to 2 percent 
Mean annual air temperature range: 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 73 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Odem, Aransas, and Buchel series on adjacent flood plains. 
Aransas and Buchel soils: are in lower positions, and have a fine particle-size control section. 
Odem soils: are on the same landscape positions and have coarse-loamy control sections. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: Well drained. 
Permeability class: Moderate. 
Runoff: Negligible on slope of 0 to 1 percent and very low on slope of 1 to 2 percent. 
Flooding: Occasionally or frequently flooded for up to brief periods from October to April  in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and some areas are used for crop production and forage production. Crops grown include corn, grain sorghum, and cotton. Native grasses are little bluestem, vine mesquite, Canada wildrye, curly mesquite grass, and windmillgrass. Woody vegetation consists of a few hackberry, mesquite, and huisache trees.
