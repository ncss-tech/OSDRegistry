SIMON SERIES

The Simon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from shale, chert, and volcanic rocks.  Simon soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Eboda, Reluctan, Say, and Toeja series.

Eboda and Say soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Reluctan soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Toeja soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have argillic horizons with bases at 64 to 100 cm from the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Simon soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived mainly from shale, chert, and volcanic rocks.  Some areas of this soil formed in colluvium derived from andesite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,610 to 2,500 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Donna and Stampede soils.  These soils have clayey argillic horizons and indurated duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Simon soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is principally big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, basin wildrye, Sandberg's bluegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada and southern Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 25, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 23 and 28B.
