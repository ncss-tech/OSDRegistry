SETTLEDRAN SERIES

The Settledran series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Settledran soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the East Fork series. East Fork soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Settledran soils are on flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Heidtman, Job, and Voltaire soils.  Heidtman soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 50 cm.  Job soils are coarse-loamy and do not have mollic epipedons.  Voltaire soils have aquic moisture regimes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 76 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from December to May.  These soils probably formed under a wetter moisture regime.  However, surface and groundwater hydrology have been altered by stream entrenchment and man-caused alterations higher in the watershed.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Settledran soils are used for pasture, hayland, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly grasses, rushes, and sedges with the composition dependent on management factors.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
