COMPETING SERIES: These are the Atkinson, Burchard, Cokato, Cresco, Cresent, Durand, Friesland, Griswold, Hitt, Jasper, Joslin, Keosauqua, Kishwaukee, Marbletown, Moingona, Morrill, Nuxmaruhanixete, Parmod, Penfield, Reedslake, Ringwood, Rockton, Shelby, Sibleyville, Velma, and Winnebago series. Atkinson, Hitt, and Rockton soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Burchard, Cokato, Cresco, Durand, Friesland, Griswold, Jasper, Joslin, Moingona, Morrill, Parmod, Penfield, Reedslake, Ringwood, Shelby, Velma, and Winnebago soils average less than 80 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Cresent, Keosauqua, Kishwaukee, and Nuxmaruhanixete soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to sand or gravelly sand textures. Marbletown and Sibleyville soils have a paralithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Schoolcraft soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and valley trains of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients typically are 0 to 4 percent but range to 6 percent. Schoolcraft soils formed in loamy material over sand or gravelly sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 11.7 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boyer, Brady, Dowagiac, Gilford, Kalamazoo, Matherton, Oshtemo, and Sebewa soils. The well drained Dowagiac and Kalamazoo soils, the somewhat poorly drained Brady and Matherton soils, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Sebewa soils are the most common associates. Boyer and Oshtemo soils are well drained associates on some outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy material and high or very high in the underlying sandy material. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and rapid in the underlying sandy material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops with smaller portions in small grains and legume-grass hay. A very small acreage is in pasture. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses with a few burr oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 97, 98, and 111C in southern Michigan and northern Indiana. The series is of moderate extent.
