TYPE LOCATION: Western Interior Rivers Area, Alaska; Buckstock Mountains, Alaska; UTM north 6774911 and UTM east 529434, zone 4.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture regime: udic
Mean annual soil temperature: about 27 degrees F, -3 C.
Depth to albic horizon: 1 to 3 inches, 3 to 7 cm 
Depth to cambic horizon: 3 to 6 inches, 8 to 22 cm 
Depth to redoximorphic concentrations: 3 to 6 inches, 8 to 22 cm 
Depth to redoximorphic depletions: 3 to 6 inches, 8 to 22 cm 

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; chroma of 1 to 1
Texture: channery moderately decomposed plant material or slightly decomposed plant material 
Coarse fragments: 0 to 30 percent channers
Reaction class: extremely acid to very strongly acid

A horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: very channery silt loam, extremely gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly silt loam
Coarse fragments: 35 to 80 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 35 percent channers
Reaction class: extremely acid to moderately acid

Bw horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; chroma of 3 or 4
Texture: gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or extremely gravelly fine sandy loam
Coarse fragments: 15 to 80 percent gravel or 0 to 20 percent subangular cobbles
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

C horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 or 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: very cobbly loam, extremely channery silt loam, gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly silt loam
Coarse fragments: 15 to 75 percent gravel, 5 to 50 percent channers, or 0 to 30 percent subangular cobbles
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Castnot and Kuzitrin series. Castnot and Kuzitrin series have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the solum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: well drained
Landforms: mountains or hills
Parent material: gravelly residuum
Slope: 5 to 55 percent
Annual precipitation: 15 to 25 inches, 393 to 657 mm
Annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F.-2 to -1 C
Frost-free period: 95 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Teggiuq, Nunaniq, and Kaviriuq soils. Teggiuq soils are permanently frozen soils at cooler positions, Nunaniq soils are well drained soils formed in loess at lower concave and linear relative positions. Kaviriuq soils are podzolized and occur on convexities and at locally higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and low to very rapid runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high through the profile.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and water shed. Native vegetation is scrub birch ericaceous shrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 230, Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands, Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
