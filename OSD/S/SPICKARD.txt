SPICKARD SERIES

The Spickard series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Spickard soils are found on slopes of 0 to 60 percent on debris aprons, debris cones, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON: Spickard ashy sandy loam, with approximately 5 percent of the soil surface covered with subangular cobbles, located on a forested northeast facing debris apron with a slope of 50 percent and an elevation of 1,130 meters.  When described on August 26, 2005 the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Doubtful series.  Doubtful soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 cm) to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spickard soils are found on slopes of 0 to 60 percent on debris aprons, debris cones, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 800 to 2,000 meters.  They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,500 to 3,300 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 8 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilliwack, Mox, and Noca soils.  Chilliwack and Mox soils have a medial fine earth fraction in the upper particle-size control section and have albic and spodic horizons.  Noca soils have a well defined albic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Spickard soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed drainage. Native vegetation includes Pacific silver fir, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, Engelmann spruce, and at lower elevations Douglas-fir and western redcedar.  Understory species include big huckleberry, evergreen huckleberry, pachistima, starry false Solomon's seal, lady fern, bunchberry dogwood, and fringecup.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
