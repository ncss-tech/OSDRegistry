SEAFIELD SERIES

The Seafield series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Udollic Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Seafield fine sandy loam, on a level area in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common very fine roots; common fine prominent black (5Y 2.5/1) manganese masses; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bt1--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common vertical pores 2 mm in diameter filled with surface material; common discontinuous thin dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) organic coatings and clay films on faces of peds; many medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; many medium faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 inches) thick]

 Bt2--30 to 41 cm (12 to 16 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; many continuous thin gray (10YR 5/1) organic coatings and clay films on faces of peds; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) thick]

 Bt3--41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common continuous thin gray (10YR 5/1) organic coatings and clay films on faces of peds; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [18 to 38 cm (7 to 15 inches) thick]

 Cg1--66 to 79 cm (26 to 31 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand; single grain; loose; common medium faint gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 inches) thick]

 Cg2--79 to 107 cm (31 to 42 inches); light gray (10YR 7/1) fine sand; single grain; loose; many medium faint gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; few medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches) thick]

 Cg3--107 to 152 cm (42 to 60 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) fine sand; single grain; loose; common medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: White County, Indiana; 1,150 feet north and 1,200 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 12, T. 27 N., R. 4 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 51 to 89 cm (20 to 35 inches)
Particle-size control section: average 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 55 percent sand

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR,
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand
Structure: massive or single grain, very friable or loose

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Seafield soils are on outwash plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Surfaces are convex. The Seafield soils formed in sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 13.9 degrees C (47 to 57 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alvin, Gilford, Morocco, and Rensselaer soils. The well drained Alvin soils are on nearby convex landscapes. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Rensselaer soils have mollic epipedons and are on adjacent flat or slightly concave landscapes. Morocco soils lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Seafield soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay are the principal crops. A small part is in permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is grass, shrubs, and deciduous trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 110 and 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of moderate extent.
