MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2003

REMARKS: Straightstone soils were previously mapped as Hanceville soils. The April 1997 adjustment of the mesic/thermic line necessitated the need to establish a mesic counterpart to the Hanceville series.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 54 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
Rhodic feature--epipedon with value of 3 (Ap horizon) and argillic horizon (Bt and BCt horizons) with hue of 2.5YR or redder and value of 3 moist and value dry no more than 1 unit higher

Laboratory Data: No known laboratory data available.
