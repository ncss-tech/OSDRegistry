SHAVANO SERIES

The Shavano series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rock. Shavano soils are on dip slopes, escarpments, strath terraces, fan remnants and pediments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 279 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Shavano sandy clay loam, on a northeast-facing 10 percent slope at an elevation of 1,914 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

        A--0 to 12 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 25 cm thick)

        Bw--12 to 53 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 46 cm thick)

        BCk--53 to 84 cm; pink (7.5YR7/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent fine calcium carbonate masses in the matrix and carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; 10 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

        R--84 cm; hard sandstone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lazear, Barboncito and Cameo soils. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Shavano soils are used mainly for rangeland with some irrigated pasture and hayland. Native vegetation is James' galleta, Indian ricegrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, fourwing saltbush and squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Shavano soils are of moderate extent in western Colorado and northwestern New Mexico. MLRA 34B and 36.
