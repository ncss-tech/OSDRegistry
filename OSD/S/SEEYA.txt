SEEYA SERIES

The Seeya series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Seeya soils are on floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chaffee, Conway, Sanpoil, and Schrader soils. 

Chaffee soils have calcareous material in the lower part of the profile and a presence of a Bq horizon.  Conway soils have 5 percent to 15 percent volcanic glass in the coarse silt to very-coarse sand fractions of the profile and lack the presence of a sandy skeletal 2C horizon. Sanpoil and Schrader soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Seeya soils are on floodplains. They formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eastwalker, Goodbye, Mostval, and Steerlay series. Eastwalker and Goodbye series have greater than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control section. Mostval and Steerlay series have a mollic epipedon thickness of less than 50cm.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table within 30 cm (very shallow to shallow free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is persistent.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and September.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Seeya soils are used for pastureland, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly sedges and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
