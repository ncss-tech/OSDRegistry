STECUM SERIES

The Stecum series consists of moderately deep to fractured, micaceous granite and gneiss, well drained soils that formed in materials derived from micaceous granite and gneiss bedrock.  These soils are on foothills of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stecum coarse sandy loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak coarse granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--5 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak coarse granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 5 percent cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    C--12 to 28 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones, and 35 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (14 to 30 inches thick)

    Cr--28 inches; fractured and partly weathered micaceous granite and gneiss.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alflack (WY), Chena (AK), Chenega (AK), Cryomont (WA), Graylock (ID), Mirror Lake (UT), Nataga (AK), Nizina (AK), Obscurity (WA), Ovando (MT), Polepatch (WA), and Studebaker (WA) series.  All of these soils are deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Stecum soils are on foothills of mountains.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in materials weathered from micaceous granite and gneiss bedrock.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Stecum soils are used mainly as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, antelope bitterbrush, Sandberg bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and rough fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Stecum soils are extensive in Montana, Colorado, and Wyoming.
