SURRETT SERIES

The Surrett series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in alluvium dominantly from limestone and quartzite on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate above the pan and moderately rapid to rapid below the pan. Surrett soils have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Duricryolls

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Surrett soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,500 feet. The soils formed in alluvium dominantly from limestone and quartzite.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer. Average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches, and average annual temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chamberlain, Geemore, Meegero, Simeroi, and Zeale soils. Chamberlain and Simeroi soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and do not have duripans.  Meegero and Zeale soils are on mountains and do not have duripans. Geemore soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces, lack duripans and have a pachic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow through rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A and Bw horizons)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 8 to 27 inches

Duripan - the zone from 27 to 36 inches (2Bkqm horizon)

The particle-size control section is the zone from 10 to 27 inches

This series would be reclassified to a Calcic Duricryolls if and when the subgroup is approved.
