SHAGEL SERIES

The Shagel series consists of shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolite. Shagel soils are on mountains and foothills. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Lithic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Shagel gravelly silt loam - on a southeast- facing convex slope of 3 percent, under low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass at 5,760 feet elevation. (On November 5, 1981 when described, soil was moist to 3 inches. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2); gravelly silt loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine platy structure parting to moderate medium and fine granular; soft, very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

  A2--3 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly silt loam; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine, few medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

  Bt--7 to 11 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine, few coarse and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on ped faces; 30 percent gravel; violently effervescent (11 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick) 

  Bk--11 to 19 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly silt loam; brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 60 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick) 

  2R--19 inches; lime coated rhyolite.

COMPETING SERIES: This is sthe Onkeyo series. Onkeyo soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shagel soils are on mountains and foothills at elevations of 5,000 to 7,300 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Shagel soils formed in colluvium and residuum from rhyolite. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F; the mean summer temperature ranges from 58 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 65 to 95 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deecree (T), Medicine, Small (T), Truble (T), and Westindian (T) series. Deecree and Medicine soils are very deep formed in mixed alluvium. Small soils are moderately deep and have an argillic horizon. Truble soils are moderately deep and have strongly contrasting particle sizes in the textural control section. Westindian soils are moderately deep to a thick, hard, indurated duripan formed in mixed alluvium on alluvial terrace slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; permeability is moderate; runoff is slow to rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Dominant use is rangeland and wildlife habitat. Principal vegetation is low sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, and winterfat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Shagel soils are inextensive in southeastern Idaho.
