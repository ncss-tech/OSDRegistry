SHALPER SERIES

The Shalper series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuffs, rhyolite and other igneous rocks.  The Shalper soils are on side slopes and crests or summits of hills and fan piedmonts with rock core.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shalper very gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 35 percent gravel.

     A1--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 15 cm thick)

     A2--13 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

     Bt--23 to 30 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent of which have silica pendants on undersides of gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

     R--30 cm; hard, fractured rhyolite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; approximately 19 miles southeast of Jackpot, NV, about l,600 feet east and 500 feet south of the northwest corner, sec. 3, T. 45 N., R. 62 E.; USGS Twin Meadows Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 49 minutes 22 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 56 minutes 56 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.8227778 latitude, -114.9477778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring and dry from July through October for 70 to 100 consecutive days; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 10 to 25 cm.
Depth to bedrock:  10 to 30 cm.
Other features:  In some pedons the mollic epipedon includes all of the Bt horizon and is underlain directly by rock.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  18 to 28 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; when the upper 18 cm are mixed, value is less than 5.5 dry and is 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Weak to moderate platy or subangular blocky.

Bt horizon
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4 moist.
Texture:  Very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam.
Clay content:  Averages 24 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.
Structure:  Weak to moderate subangular blocky and angular blocky.

Other features:  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of clay, modified by 35 to 65 percent rock fragments directly over bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anaud, Cleavage, Cleavmor, Cropper, Gaciba, Granquin, Grosschat, Horsetrack, Mascamp, Pernty, Slatter, and Tractuff series.  

Anaud, Cleavage, Cleavmor, Cropper, Gaciba, Mascamp, Pernty and Tractuff soils all have 30 to 50 cm depth to bedrock. Granquin and Grosschat soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer. Horsetrack soils average more than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Slatter soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shalper soils are on side slopes, crests and summits of hills.  These soils formed in residuum derived from welded tuffs, rhyolite and other similar igneous rocks with some small areas of granitic rock.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,590 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Quarz, Soughe and Tusel soils.  Quarz, Soughe and Tusel soils all are greater than 30 cm deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, cheatgrass, rabbitbrush and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  MLRAs 25, 24 and 28A.  These soils are moderately extensive.
