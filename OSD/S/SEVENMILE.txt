SEVENMILE SERIES

The Sevenmile series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with minor components of limestone and quartzite. Sevenmile soils are on stream terraces, drainageways, and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sevenmile soils are on stream terraces, drainageways and inset fans. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with minor components of limestone and quartzite. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,480 to 2,270 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mosida, Penoyer, and Rebel soils. Mosida soils are coarse-loamy, have ochric epipedons, and an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Penoyer soils are coarse-silty and have ochric epipedons. Rebel soils are coarse-loamy and have ochric epipedons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low or low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Sevenmile soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, thickspike wheatgrass, and basin wildrye. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRAs 28B, 28A and 29.

REMARKS: This revision updates the taxonomic classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 43 cm (A1, A2, and Bw1 horizons). 
Vitritorrandic feature - The zone from the soil surface to 43 cm (A1, A2, and Bw1 horizons). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 43 to 86 cm (Bw2 horizon). 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw2 horizon and parts of the Bw1 and C1 horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S92nv-023-006 (pedon # 92P0575). The 10/2009 update changed the classification from isotic to mixed, superactive to better reflect the series concept.
