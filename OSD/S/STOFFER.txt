STOFFER SERIES

The Stoffer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from conglomerate. These soils are on fan remnants and hillslopes. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Stoffer clay, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

 A--0 to 9 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few medium and common very fine roots between peds; common fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 cm thick)

 Bk1--9 to 24 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate very coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots between peds; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent fine calcium carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

 Bk2--24 to 45 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate very coarse platy structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent fine calcium carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons is 30 to 45 cm)
