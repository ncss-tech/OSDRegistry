STEINAUER SERIES

The Steinauer series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous till on uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 71 centimeters (28 inches).
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Steinauer clay loam with a 9 percent convex east-facing slope in pasture.  When described, the soil was moist to 41 inches.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 15 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; slightly hard, friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 18 centimeters thick)

  AC--15 to 38 centimeters; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; weak and medium coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderately fine subangular blocky; hard, firm; common fine and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 36 centimeters thick)

  C1--38 to 104 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive with common medium or strong angular planes of cleavage; hard, firm; few fine roots and tubular pores; many iron and manganese concretions; many fine and medium pockets or seams of soft lime; violent effervescence; many coarse prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) iron masses in the matrix are relict redox features; moderately alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary.  (51 to 76 centimeters thick)

  C2--104 to 152 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; massive with many medium angular planes of cleavage; hard, firm; few fine roots and tubular pores; many iron and manganese concretions; common medium pockets or seams of soft lime; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Seward County, Nebraska; about 3 miles south and 1/2 mile west of Garland; 320 meters (1,050 feet) south and 724 meters (2,375 feet) west of the northeast corner, sec. 29, T. 11 N., R. 4 E.  USGS Garland topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees, 53 minutes, 54 seconds North; longitude 96 degrees, 59 minutes, 42 seconds West, NAD 83.

Clay content: 24 to 35 percent
Sand content: 20 to 52 percent
Rock fragments:
  Content: 0 to 10 percent by volume
  Size: gravel and cobbles
  Kind: Mixed

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 to 5 moist, 3 to 6 dry

Chroma: 1 to 4,
Texture: Clay loam or loam
Clay content: 24 to 35 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Calcareous till of mixed mineralogy.
Landform: Uplands
Slopes: 5 to 60 percent
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 13 degrees C (49 to 56 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 71 to 86 centimeters (28 to 34 inches)
Frost-free period: 130 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Burchard, Geary, Morrill,
Sharpsburg, and Shelby soils.
Burchard and Shelby soils are leached of carbonates to greater depth and
have argillic horizons. They occur on lower side slopes.
Geary and Sharpsburg soils formed in loess and are fine-silty and occur above Steinauer soils.
Morrill soils have an argillic horizon and formed in loamy till or outwash that does not have free carbonates. They occur on similar landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: medium to very high
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in permanent vegetation.  
Native vegetation is tall and mid grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nebraska, western Iowa and northeastern
Kansas, southwestern Minnesota and southeastern South Dakota.  LRR 5, MLRA 106. The Steinauer soils are of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lancaster County, Nebraska, 1939.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 centimeters (Ap horizon)

11/2005 JCR LM changed to semi-tab format, added metric conversion and saturated hydraulic conductivity

AV and CL 6/30/2008 Removed the term mottling from the OSD and replaced with redox or redoximorphic features. All SE units were removed.
