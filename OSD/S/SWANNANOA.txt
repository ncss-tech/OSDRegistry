SWANNANOA SERIES 

The Swannanoa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with moderately slow permeability. They formed in old alluvium on high stream terraces, alluvial fans, and toeslopes along the broader stream and river valleys of the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B).  Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock is greater than 6 feet. Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more. Thickness of the alluvium is variable and ranges from 5 to more than 15 feet. Content of rock fragments is less than 15 percent in the A, Ap, E, BA, and BE horizons and the upper part of the Bt horizon; is less than 35 percent in the lower part of the Btg, and BCg horizons, and less than 60 percent in the Cg horizon. Unlimed soils are extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.

The BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Few to many redoximorphic concentrations in shades of red, brown, yellow, black, or olive are present. Textures include sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blago series in the same family and the Corsica, Keansburg, and Kentuck series in closely related families. Blago soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 100 inches and contain fragements of shale. Corsica and Keansburg soils are in a fine-loamy particle-size class. Kentuck soils are in a fine-silty particle-size class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Swannanoa soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping high stream terraces, alluvial fans, or foot slopes along the broader stream and river valleys of the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B).  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from about 1,800 to 2,800 feet.  These soils formed in old alluvium washed from materials weathered from low or high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks such as mica gneiss, hornblende gneiss, granite, metasandstone, and phyllite.  Mean annual air temperature is 56 and ranges from about 50 to 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation 48 and ranges from about 35 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Braddock, Brevard, Clifton, Cowee, Edneyville, Evard, Kanuga, Tate, and Unison soils. Braddock and Unison soils are well drained. Brevard and Tate soils formed in colluvium or alluvium on nearby toe slopes, benches, and fans are in a fine-loamy particle-size class. Clifton, Cowee, Edneyville, and Evard soils formed in residuum on adjacent uplands and are well drained. Kanuga soils are moderately well drained.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is moderately slow; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Surface runoff is low to moderate. Seasonal high water table is at a depth of 1.0 to 2.0 feet in winter and early spring. These soils receive surface and subsurface water from surrounding uplands.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is used for growing cultivated crops, pasture and orchards. Crops include corn, tobacco, small grains, hay, fruit and vegetables. Woodland vegetation consists of mixed hardwoods and pines, dominated by oaks, maple, poplar, hemlock and white pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B) of North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia. This series is of small extent.

SERIES PROPOSED: Henderson County, North Carolina, 2005.

REMARKS: The Swannanoa series was formerly included with the Dillard or Unison series. However, Dillard soils formed in alluvium on low terraces and are fine-loamy and Unison soils are well drained and occur on high terraces.
 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the Swannanoa series are:

Umbric epipedon-zone from 0 to 15 inches (Ap horizon)

Argillic horizon-zone from 15 to 64 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)

Aquic conditions  saturation with water in all layers from the upper boundary of saturation to a depth of 80 inches (endosaturation)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons: S03NC-089-003, S03NC-089-004 (Typical Pedon).
