SHANLEY SERIES

The Shanley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, structural benches, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shanley gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--6 to 15 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--15 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 13 inches thick.)

    Bt3--28 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles; 35 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).
