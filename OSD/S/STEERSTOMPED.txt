STEERSTOMPED SERIES

The Steerstomped series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Steerstomped soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Steerstomped soils are on stream terraces. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eastwalker and Steerlay series. Eastwalker and Steerlay soils have a Mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 75 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is common. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year round.

USE AND VEGETATION: Steerstomped soils are used for pastureland, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly rushes and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A1 and part of the A2 horizon).
Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation and reduction in horizons between 75 and 152 cm at certain times in normal years (lower C3 and 2C4 horizons).
