MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES PROPOSED: Spartanburg County, South Carolina, 2008. 

REMARKS: Spartanburg soils were previously mapped with the Cecil, Pacolet, Madison, Bethlehem, and Saw series. Cecil, Pacolet, and Madison soils are very deep to bedrock and Madison soils have high mica content in the lower B and C horizons. Bethlehem soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact and Saw soils are moderately deep to lithic contact. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 5 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 5 to 50 inches (BA and Bt horizons)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 5 to 50 inches (BA and Bt horizons)
Paralithic contact--bedrock contact at a depth of 50 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: No laboratory data available. Data from the nearby Pacolet and Cecil series sites support the kandic diagnostic horizon and kaolinitic mineralogy.
