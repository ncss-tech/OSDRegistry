SCHNIPPS SERIES

The Schnipps series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from basalt or tuff.  Schnipps soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Schnipps cobbly loam--on an 8 percent slope at an elevation of 4,900 feet--forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  The soil was dry throughout when it was described on September 15, 1998.)  The soil surface is partially covered with about 15 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.

(8 to 25 inches thick)

    Crt--49 to 65 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3), soft weathered vesicular basalt, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; common distinct clay films on pararock fragments.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Mean annual soil temperature - 45 to 47 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - 59 to 61 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 20 to 30 inches; includes the Bt1 horizon.

Argillic horizon thickness - 18 to 36 inches.

Depth to base of argillic horizon - 40 to 50 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arcia, Arva, Broadhead, Bumpheads (T), Cristo, Henefer, Rugar, and Sweitberg series.  Arcia and Sweitberg soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Arva soils have 45 to 60 percent clay and dominantly pebbles in the particle-size control section.  Broadhead and Henefer soils are very deep.  Bumpheads and Cristo soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Rugar soils average 5 to 15 percent rock fragments, which are mainly pebbles, in the particle-size control section and have paralithic material of tuffaceous sedimentary rocks within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schnipps soils are on hills.  They occur on plateau landscapes.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from basalt or tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 5,450 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 56 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Devaul, Mound, and Norcross soils.  Devaul soils are loamy-skeletal, deep to paralithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Mound soils are clayey-skeletal, deep to paralithic contacts, and have argillic horizons and thick mollic epipedons.  Norcross soils are clayey, shallow to thin duripans over bedrock, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Schnipps soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The native vegetation is a forest canopy of western juniper and ponderosa pine with an understory of Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, mountain big sagebrush, and curlleaf mountainmahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 21.
