Significant areas of the Stutler series were previously mapped as the Hesseltine series in Spokane County.

The Stutler series was updated in 2006 to allow for the presence of boulders and stones in the subsurface layer. Significant areas of the Stutler series that have a bouldery or stony subsoil were observed in 2005 in Spokane County.

This series is correlated to a ponderosa pine/common snowberry (PIPO/SYAL) habitat type.

6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
