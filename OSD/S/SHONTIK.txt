SHONTIK SERIES

The Shontik series consists of very deep, well drained, saline and sodic soils that formed in stream and fan alluvium.  Shontik soils are on stream terraces and fan terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 71 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Sodic Haplocalcids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Shontik fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shontik soils are on stream terraces and fan terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 1000 to 1450 feet.  They formed in Holocene fan or stream alluvium superimposed on Pleistocene relict basin floors.  The average annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Casa Grande, Redun, Kamato and Tatai soils.  Casa Grande and Kamato soils have natric horizons and Redun lacks a buried paleosol within 40 inches.  Tatai soils are loam and silt loam above a buried paleosol.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow or very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and irrigated cropland.  Present vegetation is mainly desert saltbush, linear-leaf saltbush and wolfberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  MLRA is 40. The soils of this series are not extensive.
