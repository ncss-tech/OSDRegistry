STEVENSGULCH SERIES

Stevensgulch series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on sideslopes and bench tops of dissected relict valley fill. Stevensgulch soils formed in colluvium and residuum from Tertiary alluvial and lacustrine deposits with minor influence of volcanic ash in surface horizons. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.
