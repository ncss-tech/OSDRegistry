REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 in.). (A, BA)
Argillic horizon: 43 to 91 cm (17 to 36 in.). (Bt)

ADDITIONAL DATA: 
Laboratory data that supports this series is: NSSL lab pedon number 40A1822 (pedon ID 76KS077001)

DATE: 1/25/95 PRF  Oklahoma requests added MLRA information.
     7.5YR colors in Bt.
     Precipitation and PE ranges.

DATE:  6/14/95 PRF  Updated the series to reflect climate conditions in MLRA 79 (Reno County).  Taxonomy was changed to mesic.

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

GLP 2/2006 The pedon used prior to 2006 was not complete.  The type location was sampled in 1976 for complete characterization.  The pedon description collected at that time is more complete and is being substituted as the official description.

GLP 7/2009 Updated the range of characteristics and the competing series as part of the MLRA 79 update project.
