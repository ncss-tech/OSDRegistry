COMPETING SERIES: There are no completing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly colluvium derived from schist
Elevation: 381 to 2119 feet
Slope: 5 to 25 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 27 inches
Annual temperature: 23 to 25 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Boldrin, Kiglauik, and Tuksuk soils. Boldrin soils are very poorly drained, shallow to moderately deep to permafrost, and occur on mountain toeslopes and footslopes. Kiglauik soils are somewhat poorly drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and occur on mountains. Tuksuk soils are very poorly drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is ericaceous shrub/lichen dwarf shrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hill-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands. Alaska. The series is of small extent.

ADDITIONAL DATA:

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
