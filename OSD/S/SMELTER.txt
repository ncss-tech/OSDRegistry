SMELTER SERIES



The Smelter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that

formed in alluvium and residuum from andesite, latite, or welded tuff.

Smelter soils are on foothills and fan terraces and have slopes of 4 to

30 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is

about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees

F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Smelter loam - on a 24 percent north-facing slope at an

elevation of 5,450 feet in rangeland.  When described on May 16, l979,

the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless

otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 9 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular

structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic,

many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial

pores; about 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy

boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)



    A2--9 to 18 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular

blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very

fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; about 5 percent pebbles;

neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)



    Bt1--18 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR

3/3) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure; very hard,

firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few

fine tubular pores; about 5 percent pebbles; continuous moderately

thick clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

(8 to 12 inches thick)



    Bt2--26 to 35 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark

yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic

structure; very hard; firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine

roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent

pebbles; continuous moderately thick clay films on ped faces and lining

pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 18 inches thick)



    BC--35 to 6l inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay

loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable,

sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine

tubular pores; about 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no soils recognized in the same family.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Smelter soils are on foothills and fan terraces.

Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,200 to

6,500 feet.  The soil formed in residuum and alluvium from andesite,

latite and welded tuff.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16

inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average

annual temperature is about 39 degrees to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free

season is 60 to 90 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Peevywell, Muldoon, and

Starhope soils.  Peevywell and Muldoon soils have duripans.  Starhope

soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Peevywell and

Muldoon soils occur on fan terraces.  Starhope soils occur on the same

landscape as the Smelter soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid.

Permeability is slow.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is Mountain

big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Nevada bluegrass,

and Lupine.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  This series is

inextensive.
