STOZUNI SERIES

The Stozuni series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone. Stozuni soils are on mesas, cuestas, and hills. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Stozuni sandy loam--woodland (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick.)

    C1--2 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and many fine and very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the C horizons is 6 to 13 inches.)

    C2--10 to 15 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the C horizons is 6 to 13 inches.)

    2R--15 inches; sandstone--weathered in the upper part

TYPE LOCATION: McKinley County, New Mexico; 2400 feet east and 2000 feet south of the northwest corner of sec 36, T. 9 N., R. 17 W.; 108 degrees 35 minutes 1 seconds west longitude, 34 degrees 58 minutes 1 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Temperature: 42 to 47 degrees F.

Particle-size control section: 6 to 18 percent clay

Depth to lithic contact: 4 to 20 inches to sandstone

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam, loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 35 percent 

C horizons:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry; 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6 dry; 2 to 4 moist
Texture: sandy loam, loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 25 percent 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Stozuni soils formed in eolian material and alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and are on mesas, cuestas, and hills. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches. The frost free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Shoemaker and Trazuni soils on summits of mesas; and the Valnor and Techado soils on hill slopes of hills. The Shoemaker and Valnor soils are moderately deep to sandstone and shale respectively. Trazuni soils are very deep and have a mollic epipedon. Techado soils have a paralithic contact to shale at less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, slow to very high runoff, and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for wood products and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is ponderosa pine, pinyon pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, alligator juniper, Gambel oak, mountain muhly, Arizona fescue, pine dropseed, bottlebrush squirreltail, prairie junegrass, and muttongrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico. MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
