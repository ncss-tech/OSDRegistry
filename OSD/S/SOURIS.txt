REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section-the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (Bk and BCk horizons; in some pedons, part of the Bw horizon is also included); 
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, Bw, Bk, BCk, and C horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: 
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface at the soil to a depth of 18 centimeters (after mixing Ap horizon and upper part of Bw horizon); 
aquic conditions--Endosaturation--75 to 100 centimeters; 
redoximorphic features--Redoximorphic concentrations, Masses--80 to 200 centimeters; Redoximorphic depletions, Iron--80 to 160 centimeters 
soil moisture control section--10 to 30 centimeters; 
udic moisture regime; 
soil temperature control section--0 to 50 centimeters; 
frigid soil temperature regime. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.

The Souris series was previously included in the concept of the Hamlet series. Hamlet has been reclassified as Aquic Hapludolls.

In areas near to Glacial Lake Souris, the till appears to have been reworked by water action with lenses of silts and fine sands observed in some pedons. This area may need further investigation.
