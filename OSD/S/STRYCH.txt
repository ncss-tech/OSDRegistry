STRYCH SERIES

The Strych series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone, shale and conglomerate. Strych soils are on fan piedmonts, highly dissected alluvial fans, fan remnants, hill toeslopes, and footslopes of cuestas, mesas, terraces, and escarpments on structural benches. Slopes are 1 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buffcreek (WY), Clapper (UT), Claprych (WY), Ildefonso (NM), Placitas (NM), Raydawn (NM) and Seis (NM) series.
Buffcreek soils have calcic horizon at 3 to 9 inches.
Clapper soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 
Buffcreek and Claprych soils have a different moisture pattern affecting the soil moisture control section; moist during May and late June and dry during July, August and September. 
Ildefonso soils are moist in some part at least 25 percent of the time the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. The driest month is November and contain Bw horizon.
Placitas and Seis soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock or paralithic contact.
Raydawn soils overlie shale-derived residuum and have hue 2.5YR in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Strych soils are on fan piedmonts, highly dissected alluvial fans, fan remnants, hill toeslopes, and footslopes of cuestas, mesas, terraces, and escarpments on structural benches. Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium from sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. Some areas have a mantle of basalt fragments up to boulder size as volcanic bombs on the soil surface and extending into the cambic horizon.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 9,000 feet. Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches. The precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in July, August, September, and October. The driest months are April, May and June. The freeze-free period is about 100 to 160 days. At elevations above 7,000 feet Strych soils are mainly on south facing slopes.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barx and Shalako soils.
Barx soils have an argillic horizon and do not have rock fragments in the particle-size control section.
Shalako soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability; moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland. The potential vegetation is Utah juniper, Salina wildrye, Indian ricegrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Utah, northern Arizona, northwest New Mexico, and western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming. The series is of moderate extent. MLRAs 34A, 34B, 35 & 36. In the future the Strych series will be limited to Central and North Eastern Utah with the MAST: 47 to 52 degrees F., MAP: 9 to 13 inches, and FFP: 100 to 160, jwb 04/2011.
