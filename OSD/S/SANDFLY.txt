COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Coarse-loamy estuarine deposits over fluviomarine deposits
Landscape--Coastal lagoons
Landform--Estuarine tidal streams
Slope--0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation--970 to 1570 millimeters (38 to 62 inches)
Mean annual air temperature--20 to 25 degrees C (69 to 77 degrees F)
Water salinity range--18 to 29 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Broadaxe, Buttonwood, Endeavor, Ittsanapper, Mullet, Tea Hammock soils.
Broadaxe soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms and are much sandier throughout.
Buttonwood soils--are on barrier cove landforms (completely different portion of the lagoon), developed in lagoonal deposits and often have thicker humilluvic materials.
Endeavor soils--are on relict flood-tidal delta sand flats and slopes, have sandier textures, and have considerable shell fragments throughout.
Ittsanapper soils--are on lagoon bottom landforms, at deeper water depths, and have thicker finer textured materials throughout.
Mullet soils--are on washover-fan flats and have sandy textures throughout
Tea Hammock soils--are also on nearby anthropogenic landforms consisting of dredge-deposit shoals

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish harvesting; benthic species include tubeworms, clams, crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish 
Native vegetation--Dominant vegetation is driven by water quality and quantity within subaqueous systems. Under excellent water quality these soils support seagrass species including but not limited to widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) and shoal grass (Halodule wrightii) due to their tolerances of low salinity and shallow water depths. Under degraded / poor water quality seagrass may be replaced by rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families. Caulerpa prolifera (Chlorophyta) is often dominant. Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 20 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the coasts of Indian River Lagoon, Florida
Land Resource Regions--U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop, and Range Region
MLRA(s)--155
Extent--Small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brevard County, Florida, 2024

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include-- 
-Peraquic soil moisture regime--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 1.2 meters of salt water).
-Particle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches).
-N-value > 0.7--The zone from 23 to 94 centimeters (Aseg1 and Aseg2 horizons).
-Taxonomic version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th edition (2022).  The correct taxonomic subgroup will need to be assigned in NASIS and OSD of Thapto-Humic Fluviwassents when available.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Typical pedon S2023FL009012. Additional supporting pedon used to develop this series include S2023FL009013.
