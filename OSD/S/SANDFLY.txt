GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Broadaxe, Buttonwood, Endeavor, Ittsanapper, Mullet, Tea Hammock soils.
Broadaxe soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms and are much sandier throughout.
Buttonwood soils--are on barrier cove landforms (completely different portion of the lagoon), developed in lagoonal deposits and often have thicker humilluvic materials.
Endeavor soils--are on relict flood-tidal delta sand flats and slopes, have sandier textures, and have considerable shell fragments throughout.
Ittsanapper soils--are on lagoon bottom landforms, at deeper water depths, and have thicker finer textured materials throughout.
Mullet soils--are on washover-fan flats and have sandy textures throughout
Tea Hammock soils--are also on nearby anthropogenic landforms consisting of dredge-deposit shoals
