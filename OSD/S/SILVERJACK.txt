SILVERJACK SERIES

The Silverjack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or landslide deposits. These soils are on mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Silverjack loam, on a 56 percent slope in native range at an elevation of 2,928 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--(0 to 3 cm); slightly decomposed aspen leaves and twigs; abrupt wavy boundary.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beachcanyon and Frisco series. Beachcanyon soils are on similar landforms and are clayey-skeletal. Frisco soils are on similar landforms on north or east-facing aspects. They have an ochric epipedon and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate over moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Silverjack soils are used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly quaking aspen, mountain brome, Columbia needlegrass, and slender wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Silverjack soils are of small extent in southwestern Colorado. MLRA 48A.
