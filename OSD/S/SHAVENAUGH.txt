SHAVENAUGH SERIES

The Shavenaugh series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains, lake plains, and moraines. These soils formed in sandy outwash overlying calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Psammentic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Shavenaugh sand, on a south-facing, convex, 1 percent slope in a pasture at an elevation of 254 meters above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on October 3, 1996, the soil was moist throughout.)

 A--0 to 13 cm (5 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; common fine and very fine roots; about 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

 E--13 to 20 cm (5 to 8 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and few medium and coarse roots; about 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [2.5 to 18 cm (1 to 7 inches) thick]

 Bw1--20 to 41 cm (8 to 16 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear irregular boundary.

 Bw2--41 to 71 cm (16 to 28 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sand; single grain; loose; few fine and very fine and common medium roots; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw3--71 to 86 cm (28 to 34 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sand; single grain; friable; few fine, very fine, and coarse roots; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 33 to 66 cm (13 to 26 inches).]

 Bt--86 to 112 cm (34 to 44 inches); very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) loamy sand; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; clay bridging of sand grains; common fine to coarse roots; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 2C--112 to 203 cm (44 to 80 inches) thick; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; about 50 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Benzie County, Michigan; 3 miles southeast of the village of Lake Ann; 2280 feet north and 1760 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 33, T. 27 N., R. 13 W., Almira Township; USGS Platte River, Michigan topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 41 minutes 43 seconds N. and long. 85 degrees 53 minutes 31 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 or 9 degrees C (47 to 49 degrees F)
Depth to carbonates: 762 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches)
Depth to the argillic horizon: typically 64 to 89 cm (25 to 35 inches) but ranges from 51 to 127 cm (20 to 50 inches)

A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: sand or loamy sand
Rock fragment content: 2 to 10 percent gravel
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

E horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: sand or gravelly sand
Rock fragment content: 2 to 20 percent gravel
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: sand or gravelly sand
Rock fragment content: 2 to 20 percent gravel
Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR
Value: 2.5 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand

Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline

2C horizon:
Hue: 10YR

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bristol, Gotham, Lilah, Montieth, and Vistula series. Bristol and Vistula soils have a Bt horizon that is thicker than 25 cm (10 inches). Gotham, Lilah, and Richford soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 127 cm (50 inches). Montieth soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shavenaugh soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. These soils formed in sandy outwash overlying calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature is 8 or 9 degrees C (47 to 49 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Benzonia, Coloma, Grattan, and Kaleva soils. The somewhat excessively drained Benzonia and Coloma soils and the excessively drained Grattan and Kaleva soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Shavenaugh soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Some areas are used for tree plantations or are idle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern lower peninsula of Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.
