SPRINGPORT SERIES

The Springport series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty and clayey lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains and depressional areas on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, frigid Typic Epiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Springport clay loam, on a 1 percent slope in a hay field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; friable; many fine and medium roots between peds; about 1 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bg--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine and medium roots between peds; many coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many coarse faint gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; about 1 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 inches) thick]

 Bt--30 to 69 cm (12 to 27 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay; very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; common fine roots between peds; few prominent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) carbonate coatings on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; few thin prominent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic coatings on vertical faces of peds; few distinct greenish gray (5GY 5/1) clay films on faces of peds; many coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many coarse prominent gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; about 1 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to 38 cm (15 inches) thick]

 C--69 to 152 cm (27 to 60 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay; weak very thick platy structure (inherent from deposition); firm; common prominent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) carbonate coatings throughout; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; about 1 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Springport soils are on lake plains and depressional areas on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Springport soils formed in silty and clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 90 to 140 days. Elevation is 183 to 396 meters (600 to 1300 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Algonquin and Negwegon soils. They are in a drainage sequence with the Springport soils. The somewhat poorly drained Algonquin soils have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons, and are on higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Negwegon soils are on higher positions in the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonally high water table ranges from 30 cm (1.0 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for growing hay, alfalfa, and occasionally corn. Other areas are in permanent pasture or woodland. Major tree species include quaking aspen, northern white cedar, balsam fir, paper birch and willow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in the northeastern quarter of Lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
