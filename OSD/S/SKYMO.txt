SKYMO SERIES

The Skymo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  Skymo soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on flood plains and terraces of river valley bottoms.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, frigid Oxyaquic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Skymo coarse sand, located on a forested south facing floodplain with a slope of 0 percent and an elevation of 130 meters.  When described on June 10, 2008 the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Skymo soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on floodplains and terraces of river valley bottoms at elevations from 100 to 600 meters.  They formed in sandy alluvium of river deposits.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,300 to 2,500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 8 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Deerlick, Nohokomeen, and Roland soils.  Deerlick soils have andic soil material greater than 35 cm thick and a cambic horizon.  Nohokomeen soils are in an Aquandic subgroup, have ashy textural modifiers in the upper part of the particle-size control section, a cambic horizon, and redoximorphic features within 45 cm of the soil surface.  Roland soils have a cambic horizon and redoximorphic features within 45 cm of the soil surface

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Skymo soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed drainage.  Native vegetation includes black cottonwood, western hemlock, western redcedar, red alder, bigleaf maple, vine maple, salmonberry, thimbleberry, western swordfern, starry false solomon's seal, sweet-scented bedstraw, and foamflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
