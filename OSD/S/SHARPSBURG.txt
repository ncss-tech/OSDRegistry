SHARPSBURG SERIES

The Sharpsburg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves and hill slopes on uplands and on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters (35 inches).

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 43 to 93 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and C horizons).
Mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 43 centimeters (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 97 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).
Udic soil moisture regime.

Redoximorphic features above a depth of 100 centimeters are believed to be related to precipitation events in abnormal years.

Thickness of the A horizon, depth to clay maximum, maximum percent clay, thickness of the Bt horizon, and depth to redoximorphic features decrease as gradient increases on convex slopes.
