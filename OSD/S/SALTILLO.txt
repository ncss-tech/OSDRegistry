SALTILLO SERIES

The Saltillo series consists of very deep poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium high in exchangeable sodium. These soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 710 millimeters (28 inches) at the type location.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brinnum and Saltine series.  
Brinnum series are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for more than 45 days out of the 120 days following the summer solstice. 
Saltine series are somewhat poorly drained with a seasonal high water table that ranges from 1.5 to 3.0 feet.

Mean annual temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C. (49 to 54 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 66 to 84 centimeters (26 to 33 inches)
Frost-free period: 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gibbon, Leshara, Lamo, Luton, Nodaway, Wood River, and Zook soils and Fluvaquents.  
All of these soils contain less sodium and soluble salts throughout the particle size control section.  
Nodaway soils and Fluvaquents do not have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:

USE AND VEGETATION:  All of the acreage is in native grass.  The common grasses are inland saltgrass, western wheatgrass, blue grama, and prairie cordgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in eastern Nebraska.  Series is of minor extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SALINA, KANSAS

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Saunders County, Nebraska, 1995.  The series name is from a township in Lancaster County.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are; 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 centimeters (6 inches) (An horizon)
Cambic horizon: 15 to 43 centimeters (6 to 17 inches) (Bn horizon) 
Areas of similar soils were commonly mapped as Slickspots in former surveys, or as a saline-alkali, or wet, phase of an established series.

ADDITIONAL DATA; NSSL data from Lancaster County, Nebraska, pedon number S73NE-109-22.

Modified format by LRM in 6/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

In Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with inland saltgrass (Distichlis spicata), foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum), annual marsh-elder (Iva annua), Plains bluegrass (Poa arida), saltwort (Salicornia rubra), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata), seablite (Suaeda calceoliformis).
