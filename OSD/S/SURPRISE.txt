SURPRISE SERIES

The Surprise series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from tuff and tuff-breccia.  Surprise soils are on fan skirts, inset fans, and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry throughout the summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 20 to 43 cm.
Depth to base of cambic horizon: 61 to 122 cm.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.
Volcanic glass content: 30 to 60 percent in the coarse silt through fine sand fractions.

Rock fragments: Averages 25 to 50 percent, mainly gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bitner, Brays, Chelan, Deskamp, Dryhollow, Emagert, Kester, Weezweed, Winblow, Yellowhills, Yotes, and Zark series.

Bitner soils have soft bedrock between 50 and 100 cm.  Brays soils are 50 to 100 cm deep over granitic bedrock.  Chelan soils have duripans within 100 to 150 cm of the soil surface.  Deskamp soils are 50 and 100 cm deep over basalt bedrock.  Dryhollow soils have gravel-size fragments that are dominantly pumice.  Emagert soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section and mollic epipedon is 61 to 122 cm thick.  Kester soils are 50 to 100 cm deep over basalt bedrock.  Weezweed soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section and organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.  Winblow soils are 50 to 100 cm deep over basalt bedrock.  Yellowhills soils have 0 to 15 percent gravel and have Bq horizons with durinodes.  Yotes soils have durinodes and secondary carbonates.  Zark soils are 50 to 100 cm deep over soft tuff bedrock and have brittle Bq and Bqk horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Surprise soils are on fan skirts, inset fans, and fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from tuff and tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is cool and continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bidwell, Buntingville, Donica and Simpson soils.  Bidwell soils have argillic horizons.  Buntingville soils are somewhat poorly drained and have argillic horizons.  Donica soils have ashy-skeletal control sections.  Simpson soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very low or low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Surprise soils are used for irrigated cropland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Alfalfa in rotation with small grains, and improved pasture are the major uses on irrigated land.  The native vegetation is dominantly big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California and northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Modoc County, California (Alturas Area), 1931.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 23 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 23 to 71 cm (Bw horizon).
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 75 cm (A1, A2, Bw and part of the C1 horizons).
Particle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (parts of the Bw and C1 horizons).

This soil is reclassified in 2006 based on optical grain count of associated soils and updated to current Soil Taxonomy.   The previous classification was coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haploxerolls.
