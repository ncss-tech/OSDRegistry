SYRETT SERIES

The Syrett series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on benches and sideslopes of mesas.  They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Syrett gravelly loam--woodland (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist, crushed; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common fine pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine pores; 40 percent gravel; violently effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    A3--4 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, medium, and coarse roots; few fine pores; 40 percent gravel; violently effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--12 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; 60 percent gravel; violently effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 14 inches thick)

    C2--23 to 38 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/8) very gravelly heavy silt loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel; violently effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 18 inches thick)

    R--38 inches; limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Garfield County, Utah; East Creek; NE 1/4 of SW 1/4 of sec. 34, T. 36 S., R. 4 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock (lithic contact) ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 70 percent in individual horizons and average 35 to 60 percent in the control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent.

The C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma 2 to 8.  It ranges from very gravelly or gravelly and very cobbly sandy loam to clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baahish (ND), Debeque (CO), and Kutler (CO) series.  Baahish soils are deep.  Debeque soils are very deep.  Kutler soils are moderately deep to a paralithic grus (highly weathered granite) contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Syrett soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping benches and moderately steep to very steep sideslopes of mesas and mountainsides.  Elevations range from 6,700 to 8,800 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone, calcareous sandstone, and shale.  Slope gradients are 2 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 100 days.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Osote, Podo, Rachert, Vanet and Winet soils.  Osote soils have an ochric epipedon and cambic horizon with less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Podo and Rachert soils have ochric epipedons and are 20 inches or less deep to bedrock.  Vanet soils have an ochric epipedon, and a cambic horizon.  Winet soils have an ochric epipedon and are over 40 inches in depth to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, pinyon pine, bitterbrush, big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, manzanita, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread grass and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Utah.  This series is moderately extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 12 inches (A1, A2, A3 horizons)

Entic feature - the soils lacks a cambic horizon.
