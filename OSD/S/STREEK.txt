STREEK SERIES

The Streek series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in a thin mantle of mixed alluvium over silty and clayey alluvium. They are on hillslopes, mountain slopes, summits, alluvial fans and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cleymor, Laplatta, Mondey, Shar (T), Top and Wickiser series. Cleymor soils have a 20 to more than 60 inch thick mollic epipedon and are formed from volcaniclastic materials. Laplatta soils have a 24 to 40 inch thick mollic epipedon. Mondey soils have secondary carbonates at 31 inches and are formed in materials weathered from sandstone.  Shar soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are formed in alluvium and loess over basalt.  Top soils do not have slickensides.  Wickiser soils have a mollic epipedon 25 to 35 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: hillslopes, mountain slopes, summits, alluvial fans and fan remnants
Elevation: 5,500 to 7,200 feet
Slope: 2 to 25 percent
Parent material: mixed alluvium over silty and clayey alluvium
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers
Average annual precipitation: 16 to 24 inches
Average annual temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cleavage, Sagollow (T) and Swanpeak (T) series. Cleavage soils are shallow to bedrock and occur on higher landscape positions. Sagollow soils have a seasonal high water table at 10 to 40 inches and occur on lower landscape positions.  Swanpeak soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section and occur on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Streek soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly mules ear, prairie junegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, oniongrass, snowberry, antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sage and small aspen groves. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The soils are of small extent.  MLRA 43B.
