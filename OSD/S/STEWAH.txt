STEWAH SERIES

The Stewah series consists of deep, well drained soils on side slopes, ridges, and shoulders of foothills and low mountains.  They formed in material from fine grained quartzites and siltite of the Libby and Striped Peak formations of the Belt supergroup that is blanketed by a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash and loess. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 15 to 55 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 37 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: 

Frycanyon soils:  are very deep
Rubson soils:  are very deep 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Stewah soils are on sideslopes, rigdes, and shoulders of foothills and low mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent.  These soils formed in fine grained quartzites or siltite with a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash and loess at elevations of 2,575 to 4,000 feet (785 to 1221 meters).  The average annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F, with an average annual precipitation of 26 to 39 inches (660 to 991 mm).  The frost free season is 85 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arson, Chesley and Reggear soils. Arson soils are on sideslopes, shoulders, and ridge summits of foothills and low mountains and have a xeric moisture regime. Chesley soils are on sideslopes and shoulders of foothills and low mountains and have a thick volcanic ash mantle. Reggear soils are on broad interfluves and have a fragipan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, Douglas-fir, grand fir and western larch with an understory of queencup beadlily, western goldthread, thimbleberry, rocky mountain maple, common snowberry, creeping Oregon grape and Columbian brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Idaho. The series is not extensive. MLRA 43A.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Latah County, Idaho, 2013.  The name is from a local stream.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 5 inches (Oi, and A horizons).

Cambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 10 inches (Bw horizon)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons).

Vitrandic feature - The zone from 1 to 10 inches (A and Bw horizons).

Paralithic contact - at a depth of 60 inches

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 30 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and part of the 2Bt3 horizons).

Series reclassified from coarse-silty to coarse-loamy 7/3/2013 based on presence of rock fragments.  The series should be investigated to determine if there is a coarse-silty counterpart that needs to be written and delineated separately.
