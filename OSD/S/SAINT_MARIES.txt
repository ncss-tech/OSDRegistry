SAINT MARIES SERIES

The Saint Maries series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains. They formed in material weathered from metasedimentary colluvium and residuum, dominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with an influence of volcanic ash and loess. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 35 to 70 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Saint Maries soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 35 to 70 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from metasedimentary colluvium and residuum from the Striped Peak Formation, dominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite, with an influence of volcanic ash and loess. Elevation is 2,200 to 4,400 feet. The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ardenvoir, Huckle, Lotuspoint, and Dorb soils. Ardenvoir soils are deep and are on south and west-facing side slopes of mountains. Huckle soils have a thick volcanic ash mantle, are deep and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains. Lotuspoint soils are moderately deep and are on south-facing ridges. Dorb soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the ash mantle, are deep, and are on north-facing basalt escarpments and canyonsides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, recreation, water supply, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural overstory vegetation is Western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western larch with an understory of queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, starry false Solomons seal, false Solomons seal, sweetscented bedstraw, and Idaho goldthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho, U.S.A.; MLRA 43A. The series is not extensive.
