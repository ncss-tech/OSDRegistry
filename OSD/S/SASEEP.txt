SASEEP SERIES

The Saseep series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium over residuum derived from shale.  Saseep soils are on slightly concave toe slopes and back slopes of shale hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Rafael series.  Rafael soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sandstone and shale over residuum derived from clayey Mancos shale
Landform:  base slopes and side slopes of shale hills
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Elevation:  1,219 to 1,981 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 11.7 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 23 cm
Precipitation pattern: The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that peaks from July to October and falls evenly throughout the remainder of the year.
Frost-free period:  120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Billings, Chipeta, Killpack, the similar Libbings, Persayo and similar Rafael series.  The Billings soils are very deep and are on alluvial fans and flood plains under shadscale.  The Chipeta, Killpack and Persayo soils are shallow or moderately deep over marine shale and are on gently rolling hills under shadscale and mat saltbush.  They do not have an aquic moisture regime. Libbings soils have a salic horizon and are usually higher on the landscape under alkali sacaton and greasewood. The Rafael soils are very deep and are on alluvial fans and flood plains under saltgrass and Baltic rush.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained, low runoff, slow permeability, rarely flooded for brief periods from March to October.   

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native plant community is saltgrass, alkali muhly, greasewood, seepweed, alkali sacaton and 
Baltic rush.  Wet Saline Meadow (Inland Saltgrass) R034XY024UT ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah; LRR D (Western Range and Irrigated Region); MLRA 34B (Central Desertic Basins, Mountains and Plateaus); inextensive.
About 500 hectares (1,200 acres) in Emery County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 115 cm 
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 90 cm.  (Akz (part), Bkyz, Byzg and Cyzg horizons)

Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 90 cm.  (Cr horizon)
Redoximorphic concentrations:  In the zone from 0 to 90 cm. (Akyz, Akz, Bkyz, Byzg and Cyzg horizons)  
Redoximorphic depletions:  In the zone from 0 to 35 cm. (Akz, Bkyz horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by samples 97P0108 and 97P0107, National Soil Survey Lab. 

Taxonomic Version:  Eleventh Edition, 2010

ADDITIONAL DATA:  This series was previously identified as the Libbings series.  The Saseep series occurs downslope from seeping irrigation canals, and the soil moisture control section is directly affected by seasonal irrigation.  It is likely that the gypsic horizon is gradually being destroyed by lateral fresh water flow from these canals.  Unexpectedly low EC values may be related to this lateral fresh water flow.
