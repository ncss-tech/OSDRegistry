STUCKEY SERIES

The Stuckey series consists of moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in material weathered from diabase, diorite, gabbro, and other rocks high in ferro-magnesium minerals. They are on uplands throughout the 
Piedmont. Slope is dominantly less than 6 percent but ranges up to 15 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Oxyaquic Vertic Hapludalfs

plastic; many fine and medium roots along faces of peds; few medium pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common soft dark grayish brown and black saprolite; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)
  C1--27 to 32 inches; finely mottled dark greenish gray, very pale brown, and yellowish brown loam; 80 percent saprolite that crushes easily; many fine roots and few distinct clay films along cleavage planes; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.
  Cr--32 to 60 inches; finely mottled dark greenish gray, very pale brown, black and yellowish brown sandy loam; 90 percent saprolite that crushes easily; many fine roots and few distinct clay films along cleavage planes; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.
  
TYPE LOCATION: York County, South Carolina; on U.S. Highway 72 bypass one mile south of Chester; site is across road from Southside School, 233 feet north of fire hydrant.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to paralithic contact (Cr horizon) is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. Linear extensibility totals 6.0 cm or more between the surface and paralithic contact. Most pedons have few to many dark concretions throughout the profile. Many pedons have few to many dark mottles or soft bodies in the B and C horizons. Some pedons have few to many flakes of mica or crystals of feldspar in the B and C horizons. The soil is strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the B horizon, 
and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon. Content of rock fragments, up to 24 inches in diameter, ranges from 0 to 30 percent in the A horizon and E horizon, 0 to 20 percent in the Bt horizon, and 0 to 10 percent in the C horizon. 

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 
of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.

The upper part of the Bt or Btss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. The middle part of the Bt or Btss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. The lower part of the Bt ot Btss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. 
Content of clay in the Bt or Btss horizon ranges from 40 to 85 percent in the upper part and from 35 to 60 percent in the middle and lower part. The weighted average content of clay of the upper 20 inches of the Bt or Btss horizon ranges from 40 to 60 percent.

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles may occur in shades of red brown, or yellow. Texture is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.

The C horizon commonly is mottled or multicolored in shades of white, gray, brown, yellow, or black. It commonly is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or silt loam saprolite.

The Cr horizon is highly fractured, highly weathered rock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Iredell, Polkton, and White Store series. Iredell soils have a depth to paralithic or lithic contact of more than 60 inches.  Polkton soils have a depth to a seasonal high water table of 1.5 to 2.5 feet, a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and formed from Triassic siltstone, mudstone, shale, and conglomerates. White Store soils have a depth to seasonal high water table of 1.0 to 1.5 feet and are formed from Triassic siltstone, musdtone, sandstone, shale, and conglomerate. Similar soils in other families are the Crawfordville(T), Enon, Pittsboro, Winnsboro, and Wynott series. Crawfordville soils (T) have a depth to a seasonal high water table of 1.0 to 2.0 feet.  Enon and Winnsboro soils do not have slickensides and have a depth to a seasonal high water table at greater than 6 feet. Pittsboro and Wynott soils have a depth to paralithic contact of 20 to 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Iredell soils are on uplands throughout the Piedmont. Slopes range from 0 to about 15 percent, but generally are less than 6 percent. The soils formed in materials weathered from diabase, diorite, gabbro, and other rocks high in ferro-magnesium mineral. The average annual rainfall ranges from 
37 to 60 inches, the frost-free season ranges from 190 to 225 days, and mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Crawfordville, Enon, Pittsboro, Winnsboro, and Wynott series and the Cullen, Davidson, Helena, Lloyd, Mecklenburg, and Wilkes series. Cullen and Mecklenburg soils have a Bt horizon 
with a hue of 5YR or redder. Davidson and Lloyd soils are rhodic. Helena soils do not have slickenslides and are strongly to very strongly acid throughout. Wilkes soils are shallow to paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; medium runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for growing cotton, small grain, hay, or pasture. Forested areas are dominantly in post and white oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Piedmont areas of South Carolina, and possibly North Carolina and Georgia. The series is of moderate extent.
