SLAUGHTERHOUSE SERIES

The Slaughterhouse series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over metavolcanic colluvium on mountain backslopes and summits. Slope gradients are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and mean annual temperature about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic, frigid Alfic Vitrixerands 

TYPICAL PEDON: Slaughterhouse ashy silt loam - conifer forest, on a 45 percent south-facing slope at an elevation of 5,520 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  Soil textures are apparent field textures.)
