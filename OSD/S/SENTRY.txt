SENTRY SERIES

The Sentry series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gypsiferous fine-loamy alluvium. These nearly level soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F (18 degrees C).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing soil series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sentry soils are stream terraces. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed from gypsiferous fine-loamy alluvium. Elevation ranges from 3,950 to 4,000 feet (1204 to 1219 meters). The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches (203 to 254 mm). Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F (17 to 19 degrees C). The frost-free period is 200 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Najul (NM) and Bigsalt (NM) soil series.  Najul soils are fine textured, gypsic mineralogy, non-salids and are on floodplains. The Bigsalt soils are fine textured, gypsic mineralogy and are found on floodplains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, desert seepweed, and honey mesquite. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin. MLRA 42, Sentry is of very limited extent.
