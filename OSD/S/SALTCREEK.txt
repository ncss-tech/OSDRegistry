SALTCREEK SERIES 


The Saltcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over buried alluvium. These soils are on dunes on paleoterraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm (28 in.) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F) at the type location.
