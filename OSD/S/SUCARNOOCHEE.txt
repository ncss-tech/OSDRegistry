SUCARNOOCHEE SERIES

The Sucarnoochee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alkaline clayey alluvium. Sucarnoochee soils are on flood plains of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1400 millimeters (55 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Epiaquerts

Houlka soils are in similar positions on flood plains and are acid throughout the solum.
Leeper soils are in similar positions on flood plains and do not have intersecting slickensides within 102 centimeters (40 inches) of the soil surface.
Demopolis, Faunsdale, Houston, Kipling, Okolona, Sumter, and Vaiden soils are on adjacent uplands and are not subject to flooding. 
Tuscumbia soils are poorly drained and are on similar and slightly lower depressional positions on flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Somewhat poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): low
Water features: No free water has been observed in these soils except on slickenside faces or in large root channels. The dark surface, subsurface and low chroma matrix colors are derived from the colors of the parent material and hydrology.
Flooding frequency: occasional or frequent
Flooding duration: brief or very brief
Ponding frequency and Duration: None

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have been cleared. Current use is dominantly pasture. About 30 percent of the acreage is in cultivated crops, mainly soybeans, corn, grain sorghum, and cotton. About 5 percent of the soils are in mixed hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Major Land Resource Area (MLRA): Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie(MLRA 135A) 
Extent: Moderate extent.
