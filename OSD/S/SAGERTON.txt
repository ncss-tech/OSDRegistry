SAGERTON SERIES


The Sagerton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on treads of terraces on dissected alluvial plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 610mm (24 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).
