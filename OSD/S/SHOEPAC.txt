SHOEPAC SERIES 

The Shoepac series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and moderately high in the substratum. Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Oxyaquic Haplorthods

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Annalake, Goodwit, Mashek, Mundalite, Newood, Padwood, Peavy, Sarwet and Tipler series.
Annalake - have thinly stratified glaciofluvial materials below 76 to 152 centimeters.
Goodwit - have silty loess mantle 30 to 102 centimeters thick, and have an argillic horizon with 8 to 17 percent clay.
Mashek - have dense till at 89 to 127 centimeters.
Mundalite soils do not have Bt horizons below the spodic and are 64 to 102 centimeters to dense basal till.
Newood soils have an argillic horizon that average 7 to 17 percent clay, are slightly acid or more acid in the substratum and have dense basal till at 102 to 203 centimeters.
Padwood and Tipler soils have stratified sandy and gravelly outwash materials at 61 to 102 centimeters.
Peavy soils have dense till (Cd horizons) at depths between 102 to 152 centimeters and are more acid in the substratum.
Sarwet soils are more acid in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shoepac soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines. Slope gradients range from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 860 millimeters and mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 6 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carbondale, Charlevoix and Trenary soils. The very poorly drained Carbondale soils are in depressions. The well drained Trenary soils are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Charlevoix soils are on lower landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to representative wet soil moisture status ranges from 46 to 152 centimeters below the surface at times during the months of March, April, May, June, October, November, and December. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper solum and moderately high in the substratum. Runoff is slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are forested with small areas cleared for farming. Tree species include sugar maple, American basswood, yellow birch, ironwood, paper birch, quaking aspen, and Eastern hemlock. Common ground plants are Sweet Cicely, Spinulose Woodfern, Rattle Snake Fern, Bloodroot, Twisted Stalk, Landy Fern, Downy Yellow Violet and Trilliums. Agricultural crops are hay and small grains.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Marquette County, Michigan, 1994. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are: Albic horizons - 5 to 15 centimeters and 58 to 84 centimeters (E and E part of E/Bt horizon)
Spodic horizon - 15 to 58 centimeters (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - 84 to 135 centimeters (Bt horizon)
Oxyaquic subgroup - the soil is saturated with water in one or more layers within 100 centimeters of the soil surface layer for 1 month or more per year.

The Shoepac series was originally proposed in Mackinac County, Michigan but was later re-correlated to the Graveraet Series.
