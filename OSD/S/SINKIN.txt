SINKIN SERIES

The Sinkin series consist of very deep, well drained to somewhat excessively well drained soils formed in very to extremely gravelly alluvium and colluvium over highly weathered clayey or very gravelly clayey residuum from dolomite. These nearly level soils occur in upland drainages within the Ozark Highlands. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual soil temperature is about 14 degrees Celsius. Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters.

USE AND VEGETATION:
These soils are used for the production of timber, wildlife habitat, and related natural resources. Some areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is mixed conifer-deciduous woodlands. The overstory in most areas consists of shortleaf pine, black oak, scarlet oak, post oak, pignut hickory, and black hickory. The understory contains blueberries, tick-trefoils, lespedezas, asters, goldenrods, mixed grasses, upland sedges and various other woodland forbs and vines indicative of acidic environments.
