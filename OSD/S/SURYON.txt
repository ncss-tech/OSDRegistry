SURYON SERIES

The Suryon series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium from sandstone.  They are on hillslopes, mountain slopes, ridges and fan remnants.  Permeability is moderate.  Suryon soils have slopes of 4 to 50 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Suryon loam, rangeland; on a 6 percent slope at 6,470 feet elevation.  When described on July 17, 1991 the soil was dry in the upper 17 inches and moist below. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and common medium tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.1); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and coarse roots; many very fine and medium and common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--10 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; many very fine and medium and common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw2--17 to 29 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine and medium tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw3--29 to 38 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine and medium tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 16 inches thick)

    C1--38 to 49 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine and medium tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (11 to 25 inches thick)

    C2--49 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (11 to 25 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Iver, Kabear, Lobert, Ola, Prucree (T), Redmount, Shively, Taterpa, and Wagore series.  Iver soils have a lithologic discontinuity to skeletal material within the control section.  Kabear soils have hue of 10YR and have average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F.  Lobert soils have average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F. and contain durinodes.  Ola and Prucree soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Redmount soils have average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F. and have skeletal material at 26 to 40 inches.  Shively soils have average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F. and do not have Bw horizons.  Taterpa soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and are slightly acid in the lower part of the particle-size control section and have average annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F.  Wagore soils have average annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F. and hues of 10YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Suryon soils are on hillslopes, mountain slopes, ridges and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,200 to 7,200 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium from sandstone.  Average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches, average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F., the frost free period is 65 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dipcreek (T), Prucree (T), and Vipont soils.  Dipcreek soils are shallow to bedrock and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Prucree soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Vipont soils have an argillic horizon and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Dipcreek and Prucree soils are on ridgetops, mountainsides, and hillsides generally above Suryon soils.  Vipont soils are generally on south-facing ridge sides above Suryon soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Suryon soils are used for rangeland.  The native vegetation is basin big sagebrush and giant wild rye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008.  The name is coined from a nearby canyon.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 38 inches (the A1, A2, Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons).  The dark colors below the Bw3 horizon are related to the parent material.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (the Bw1, Bw2, Bw3 and part of the C1 horizons).
