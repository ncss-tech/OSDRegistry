SHURTLEFF SERIES

The SHURTLEFF series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from interbedded, calcareous sedimentary rocks. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Shurtleff loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 5 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; 2 percent channers; finely disseminated carbonate, slightly effervescent; 9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick)

 Bk1--5 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 1 percent channers; finely disseminated carbonate, slightly effervescent; 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. 

 Bk2--25 to 55 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine roots and fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 2 percent channers; finely disseminated carbonate, 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons is 40 to 75 cm)

 Bk3--55 to 87 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent channers; 10 percent carbonate masses in the matrix; violently effervescent; 22 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.

 Bk4--87 to 127 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; common very fine irregular pores; 15 percent channers; 15 percent carbonate masses in the matrix; violently effervescent; 24 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary. 

 Bk5--127 to 200 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; 10 percent channers; 10 percent carbonate masses in the matrix; violently effervescent; 13 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.
