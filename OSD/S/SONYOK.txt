SONYOK SERIES

The Sonyok series consists of very deep, very poorly drained sodium affected soils in swales and on low fan terraces in the Hot Springs Valley.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevation is 790 to 880 meters.  The average annual precipitation is about 310 mm; the average annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, nonacid, frigid Aeric Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sonyok silty clay loam, 0 to 4 percent slopes, in pasture.  (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 8 cm; undecomposed and partially decomposed matted roots.

    Ap--8 to 26 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; many fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redox concentrations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 20 cm thick)

    Bwn1--26 to 46 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; many fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redox concentrations; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 25 cm thick)

    Bwn2--46 to 71 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; many fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redox concentrations; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness - 35 to 90 cm thick)

    C--71 to 160 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive, distinct, 3 to 6 mm varves; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--broad swales and on lake plains and terraces
Elevation--790 to 880 meters
Slope--0 to 4 percent
Parent material--alluvium and lacustrine material

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sonyok soils are used mainly for pasture and hayland.  There are no known areas of native vegetation.  Estimated potential native vegetation is grasses, sedges and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Sonyok soils are of limited extent in the Hot Springs Valley of northwestern Montana; MLRA 44A.
