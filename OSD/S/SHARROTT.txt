SHARROTT SERIES 

The Sharrott series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from argillite or quartzite bedrock.  These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 85 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sharrott gravelly loam, forested (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    0i--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A--2 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine to coarse roots; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--6 to 15 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine to coarse roots; 40 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick) 

    BC--15 to 17 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and coarse roots; 70 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt irregular boundary. 

    R--17 inches; fractured argillite bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - mountains. 
Elevation - 2,500 to 5,600 feet. 
Slope - 4 to 85 percent. 
Parent material - material derived from argillite or quartzite. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 17 to 25 inches. 
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sharrott soils are used mainly for timber production, understory grazing, and watershed and as wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, pinegrass, Idaho fescue, arrowleaf balsamroot, and common snowberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Sharrott soils are of small extent in western Montana.  MLRA 43A, 43B and 46.
