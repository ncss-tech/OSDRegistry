SHIVLUM SERIES

The Shivlum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rocks with a component of loess.  Shivlum soils are on mountains, hills, fan remnants, and partial ballenas.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shivlum silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0) clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 23 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common fine tubular and common very fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt1--23 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular and very fine interstitial pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and common faint clay films lining pores; neutral (pH 7.2) clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--38 to 86 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.2) clear wavy boundary.  (30 to 66 cm thick)

    2Bt3--86 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.2)

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; in the Adobe Range about 10 miles west of Elko; about 1,800 feet east and 1,800 feet north of the southwest corner of section 19, T. 34 N., R. 54 E.; USGS Hunter 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 49 minutes 00 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 56 minutes 38 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.8166667 latitude, -115.9438889 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shivlum soils are on mountains, hills, fan remnants, and partial ballenas.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from shale, sandstone, chert, conglomerate, and welded tuff with a component of loess.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 2,350 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 280 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cleavage, Pernty, and Sumine soils.  

Cleavage and Pernty soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Sumine soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Shivlum soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 25.
