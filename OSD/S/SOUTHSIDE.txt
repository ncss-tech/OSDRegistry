SOUTHSIDE SERIES

The Southside series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy and/or gravelly alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age. These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils occur on risers of stream terraces on plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Typic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Southside sandy loam, on a 9.5 percent slope in rangeland.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Thickness is 13 to 46 cm (5 to 18 in)

    C1--15 to 71 cm (6 to 28 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6), gravelly loamy sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist; massive; soft, loose; few fine roots; common fine pores; 34 percent rounded siliceous gravel with thin strata containing up to 60 percent gravel; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. Thickness is 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in)

    C2--71 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6), sand, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6), moist; massive; loose, loose; very few fine roots; few fine pores; 5 percent rounded siliceous gravel; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  
These are the Goodnight, Jester, and Tivoli series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Likes series.
Goodnight soils: formed in eolian sediments, do not have gravelly textures, and occur in more moist climates.
Jester soils: formed in eolian sediments, do not have gravelly textures, and occur in lower positions near streams.
Tivoli soils: formed in eolian sediments, do not have gravelly textures, are noncalcareous throughout the control section, and occur on higher terrace positions.
Likes soils: are derived from Ogallala Formation material and contain siliceous gravels, fragments of caliche and sandstone, and occur in a drier climate.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Sandy and/or gravelly alluvium of Pleistocene age.
Landscape: Alluvial plains, Dissected plains
Landform: Risers of stream terraces
Slope: 1 to 20 percent
Mean annual precipitation range: 20 to 28 inches
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 44
Mean annual air temperature range: 57 to 64 degrees F.
Frost-free period: 180 to 230 days
Elevation: 1,000 to 2,300 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
These are the Arnett, Fortyone, Hardeman, and Jester series. 
Arnett soils: These soils occur on higher positions, have a fine-loamy particle size control section, and have argillic horizons.
Fortyone soils: These soils occur on similar positions, have a coarse-loamy particle size control section, and have argillic horizons.
Hardeman soils: These soils occur on similar positions and have a coarse-loamy particle size control section with less gravel content.
Jester soils: These soils occur on lower positions near rivers and large streams and do not have gravelly textures.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: Somewhat excessively drained
Permeability class: Rapid
Runoff class: negligible on 1 to 5 percent slopes and very low on 5 to 20 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: livestock grazing
Native vegetation: a mixture of tall and mid grasses

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Greer County, OK, 2006. Proposed in Greer County, OK, 2003. The name comes from an old school in Jackson County.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
  Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) (C1 and C2 horizons)
  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizon)
  Other features: Psamments - less than 35 percent by volume rock fragments and a texture of loamy fine sand or coarser in all layers between a depth of 25 to 100 cm from the mineral soil surface.

Additional Comments: These soils were formerly mapped as Sandy Broken Land or Likes in earlier soil surveys.  Areas of this soil have been mined for use as roadbed material.
