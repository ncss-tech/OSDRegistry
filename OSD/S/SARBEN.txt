SARBEN SERIES

The Sarben series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in reworked loamy and sandy sediments in the sand-loess transition areas.  These upland soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sarben loamy very fine sand - with a 5 percent convex slope in native grassland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy very fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) thick)

   AC--18 to 41 centimeters (7 to 16 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy very fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) thick)

   C1--41 to 74 centimeters (16 to 29 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy very fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive, soft, very friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 51 meters (0 to 20 inches) thick)

   C2--74 to 203 centimeters (29 to 80 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy very fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Banner County, Nebraska; about 19 kilometers (12 miles) east and 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of Harrisburg; 182 meters (600 feet) west and 182 meters (600 feet) north of the southeast corner, sec. 2, T. 19 N., R. 54 W.  Wright Gap topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees, 38 minutes, 36 seconds North and longitude 103 degrees, 30 minutes,15 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Depth to carbonates: 38 to 102 centimeters (15 to 40 inches)

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR 
Values: 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or loamy fine sand
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

AC horizon: (where present)
Hue: 10YR
Values: 5 or 6, and 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sandy loam. 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

C horizon
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 5 to 8, and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand or very fine sandy loam
Sandy loam strata: below depths of 76 centimeters (30 inches) in some pedons  
Sandy textures: below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) in some pedons  
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: very gently sloping to very steep on uplands   
Slope: commonly 3 to 20 percent but range 0 to 60 percent 
Parent material: reworked loamy and sandy sediments in a sand-loess transition area
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. (47 to 54 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bayard, Busher, Creighton, Dailey, Duroc, Jayem, Valent, and Vetal soils.
Bayard, Busher, Creighton, and Jayne soils are on similar landscapes.
Creighton and Jayem soils have a mollic epipedon.  
Dailey and Valent soils are coarser textured and generally are higher on the landscape.  
Duroc and Vetal soils have mollic epipedons more than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick and are lower on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low on very gentle slopes to rapid on steep and very steep slopes 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils are in native grass.
The dominant species is needleandthread, prairie sandreed, blue grama and western wheatgrass.  
The cultivated areas are primarily in a wheat-fallow rotation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nebraska, and possibly southwestern South Dakota, western Kansas, eastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado.   The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dawes County, Nebraska, 1973.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A horizon)

The Sarben series was formerly classified as coarse-loamy, mixed, non-acid, mesic Ustic Torriorthents
