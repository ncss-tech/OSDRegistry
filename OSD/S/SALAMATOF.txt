SALAMATOF SERIES

Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: very poorly drained
Parent material: coarse sphagnum moss interlayered with sedge peat
Landform: in depressions and fens on outwash plains
Slopes: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 28 inches.
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Dysic Sphagnic Cryofibrists

TYPICAL PEDON: Salamatof peat - undisturbed (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi1--0 to 10 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) squeezed dry, sphagnum moss peat and pockets of coarse sedge peat; common roots of woody shrubs; extremely acid (pH 4.4); gradual boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

	Oi2--10 to 60 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) moist, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) squeezed dry, moss peat interlayered with sedge peat; a few layers of finely divided peat; many woody fragments; extremely acid (pH 4.4).

TYPE LOCATION: Anchorage Area, Alaska; about 1/4 mile south of Six Mile Lake; in the NE 1/4 of the SE 1/4, section 21 T. 14N, R 3W,: Anchorage B8SE 1:25,000 quad, Seward Meridian; UTM 6797819 north and UTM 0349415 east, zone 6.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Oi1 horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 5; chroma of 2 to 4
Coarse fragments: 0 to 5 percent wood fragments
Reaction Class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

Oi2 Horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 5; chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: sphagnum moss, sedge peat, woody particles, finely divided peat, woody peat
Coarse fragments: 0 to 25 percent wood fragments
Reaction class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Kogish series. Kogish soils have mucky peat textures in below 36 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: very poorly drained
Parent material: coarse sphagnum moss interlayered with sedge peat
Landform: in depressions and fens on outwash plains
Slopes: 0 to 5 percent
Climate: cool summers and long moderately cold winters 
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 38 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 28 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beluga, Chulitna, Coal Creek, Cohoe, Homestead, Island, Kalifonsky, Nancy, and Naptowne soils. Chulitna, Cohoe, Homestead, Island, Nancy, and Naptowne soils are all well drained mineral soils of adjacent upland areas. Beluga, Coal Creek and Kalifonsky soils are poorly drained mineral soils occuring along fen and bog borders. The poorly drained 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, negligible or very rapid runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Water table is always at or near the surface.

USE AND VEGETATION: Recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of sphagnum moss, dwarf birch, Labrador tea, other low-growing shrubs, sedges, and black spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is extensive.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kenai - Kasilof Area, Alaska, 1960.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile include: Fibric material from 0 to 60 inches
Surface tier: is dominated (more than 75 percent) by sphagnum fibers
Reaction class less than 4.5 (0.01 M CaCl2) throughout the soil
Temperature regime: cryic

ADDITIONAL DATA: Type location was relocated to the Anchorage Area, Alaska. Salamatof soils were not used when the Matanuska Valley Area, Alaska was updated to Matanuska-Susitna Valley Area, Alaska.
