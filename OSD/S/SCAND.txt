SCAND SERIES

The Scand series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over material from high mica schist and gneiss with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on structural benches, mountain slopes and ridges.  Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brodeer, Chesley, Cranberry, Disalto, Dworshak, and Helmer series. Chesley soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Cranberry soils have textures finer than loam in the 3Bt horizons and have less than 30 percent fine mica flakes.  Disalto soils have less than 15 percent mica throughout. Brodeer soils do not have a 3Bt or BC horizon.  Dworshak soils have less than 30 percent fine mica flakes. Helmer soils are shallow to a fragipan.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Scand series are on structural benches, mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of  1,600 to 4,200 feet.  They have slopes of 15 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in loess over residuum from high mica schist and gneiss with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches.  The frost-free season is 50 to 110 days (9 years in 10 to 1 year in 10, respectively).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grandad, Lado, Norwidge, Poorman, Scaler and Threebear soils. Grandad soils are on mountain slopes and ridge tops, and lack a 3Bt or 3BC horizon.  Lado soils are on mountain slopes and have less than 30 percent fine mica flakes.  Norwidge soils are on mountain slopes and have fragic characteristics.  Poorman and Scaler soils are on mountain slopes and ridge tops and have a thin volcanic ash mantle.  Threebear soils are on mountain slopes and have a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, Douglas fir, grand fir and western white pine with an understory of queencup beadlilly, goldthread, starry false Solomons seal, columbia brome and baldhip rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-Central Idaho; Scand soils are not extensive.
