SUMMERFIELD SERIES

The Summerfield series consists of deep, somewhat poorly
drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy over
clayey sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands of the southern Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from
0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, thermic Aeric Endoaquults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Summerfield very fine sandy loam--forest.
(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

A11--0 to 3 inches; very dark grayish brown (7.5YR 3/2) very
fine sandy loam; moderate fine granular structure; very friable;
many fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 5
inches thick)

A12--3 to 8 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) very fine sandy
loam; common fine distinct strong brown mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; few
medium black concretions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

B1--8 to 16 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loam; many
medium distinct light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) mottles; weak
medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few medium brown concretions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

B21t--16 to 24 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and light
brownish gray (2.5YR 6/2) loam; moderate medium and coarse
subangular blocky structure; firm; few medium strong brown and
black concretions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to
20 inches thick)

B22t--24 to 27 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam;
many coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine strong brown concretions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 4
inches thick)

A'2--27 to 29 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt
loam; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; white silt and very fine sand coatings on all ped faces; very strongly acid;
abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

IIB'2t--29 to 35 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) clay; common medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) and common medium distinct yellowish
brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common patchy clay films; white very fine sand coatings on major ped faces; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 30 inches thick)

IIB'3t--35 to 50 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) and
strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; very strongly acid.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

C--50 to 70 inches; light olive brown (5Y 6/2) clay; many
medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak fine
platy bedding planes; firm; few mica flakes; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  DeSoto Parish, Louisiana; 6 miles west of
Keatchie, 0.9 mile north of road on farm road, 600 feet south-southeast of house; east of dairy barn, NE1/4NW1/4NW1/4,
sec. 21, T. 14 N., R. 16 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40
to 70 inches.  Depth to clayey IIB' horizon ranges from 18 to 36 inches.

The A1 horizon is very dark grayish brown (7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/2),
dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 7.5YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR
5/2), dark brown (10YR 4/3), or brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Very dark grayish brown colors are restricted to horizons less than 8 inches thick.  The
A1 horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.

The Bt horizon is strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8), brown (7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/3), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8) silt loam,
loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Mottles in shades of gray are common to many.  The Bt horizon averages at
least 20 percent more clay than the overlying A horizon.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.

The A'2 horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2) silt, silt loam, or very fine sand.

The IIB' horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), light grayish brown
(10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 5/2) clay, silty clay, or sandy clay.  Mottles are in shades of brown.  The
IIB' is strongly acid to extremely acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Augusta and Yemassee series in the
same family and Kullit, Leaf, Lumbee, Myatt, Ogeechee, Sawyer, and Sylacauga series.  Augusta, Kullit, Lumbee, Ogeechee, Myatt, Sylacauga, and Yemassee soils lack both A' and clayey IIB'
horizons.  Leaf soils have clayey family textures and dominantly 1
or 2 chroma throughout the B horizon.  Sawyer soils have
fine-silty over clayey textures and have dominant chromas of 4 or more in the B horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Summerfield soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands of the Gulf Coastal Plain.  Sandy "pimple" mounds are a common feature of the landscape in many areas.
Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent but range up to 3 percent.
The regolith is unconsolidated loamy and clayey acid Coastal Plain sediments.  The climate is warm and humid, mean annual
precipitation is 45 inches, and mean annual temperature is 65
degrees F., at the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing
Sawyer series as well as Boswell, Bowie, Caddo, and Susquehanna soils.  Boswell soils have redder hues and contain more than 35 percent clay throughout the argillic horizon.  Bowie soils are
less clayey throughout and their argillic horizons contain
plinthite.  Caddo soils are less clayey and are grayer throughout.  Susquehanna soils have fine textured upper B horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is
slow to very slow, internal drainage is slow, and permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly in forest but a few areas are in
pasture.  Trees are dominantly post oak and other oaks, sweetgum, hickory, and holly.  Trees on the mounds are mainly shortleaf and loblolly pines.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The western part of the southern Coastal Plain in Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, and possibly Alabama and Mississippi.  The series is of moderate extent.
