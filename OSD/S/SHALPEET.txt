SHALPEET SERIES


The Shalpeet series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and herbaceous plant materials. The Shalpeet soils are on floodplains.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Shalpeet peat--irrigated pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oe--0 to 15 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mucky peat, black (10YR 2/1) moist; about 60 percent herbaceous fiber material unrubbed, about 25 percent rubbed; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

     A--15 to 61 cm;  stratified mucky peat, muck and silt loam layers 0.3 to 5 cm thick, mineral part, gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam,  very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and many very fine interstitial pores; organic part, very dark gray (10YR 3/1), mucky peat and muck, black (N 2.5/) moist; 30 to 60 percent herbaceous fiber material unrubbed; about 10 to 30 percent rubbed; many very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (30 to 70 cm thick)

     C--61 to 76 cm; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) sandy clay loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; many medium and coarse distinct olive (5Y 5/6) redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 30 cm thick)

     2C--76 to 168 cm; gray (5Y 6/1) gravelly loamy coarse sand, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; few discontinuous gray (5Y 5/1) moist, loamy coarse sand strata less than 10 cm thick; many medium and coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Usually saturated to the surface throughout the year in most years.
Mean annual soil temperature:  8 to 12 degrees C.
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 30 to 58 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Average 27 to 35 percent in the upper part and 0 to 10 percent in the lower portion.
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent in the upper part, and averages 15 to 30 percent, dominantly gravel in the lower portion.

O horizon
Hue: 10YR or N (neutral).
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 0 or 1.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.
Other features:  Organic matter source is primarily herbaceous material from material such as sedges and rushes.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or N (neutral).
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 0 or 1.
Texture: Stratified silt loam, loam mucky peat and muck.  Averages mucky loam or mucky silt loam when mixed.
Clay content:  10 to 18 percent.
Organic carbon content:  7 to 12 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent.

Chroma:  1 or 2.
Texture:  Sandy clay loam or clay loam.
Consistence:  Hard or very hard dry and friable or firm moist.
Redoximorphic features:  Common to many redox concentrations as soft iron masses.

2C horizon
Hue: 2.5Y, 5Y or 5GY.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  0 through 2.
Redoximorphic features:  Common to many redox concentrations as soft iron masses.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Suman series.  Suman soils do not have mineral layers interstratified with organic layers.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shalpeet soils are on floodplains.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks and herbaceous plant materials.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 1,420 to 1,450 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kimmerling, Ophir and Settlemeyer series.  These soils all lack thick O horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Pasture and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly sedges, rushes and other hydrophytic herbaceous vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-western, Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
