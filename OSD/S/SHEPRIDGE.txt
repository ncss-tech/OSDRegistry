SHEPRIDGE SERIES

The Shepridge series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium over residuum derived from quartzite.  Shepridge soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shepridge extremely gravelly loam, on a southwest facing, convex to convex, 17 percent slope in sagebrush at an elevation of 5,612 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The surface is covered by 65 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles of quartzite origin and angular in shape.

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine tubular and interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine and very fine angular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular and interstitial pores; few patchy faint clay skins on ped faces; 65 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--9 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine and very fine angular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine, few fine tubular and interstitial pores; few patchy faint clay skins on ped faces; 75 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (total thickness of Bt horizons 8 to 14 inches)

    R--13 inches; fractured quartzite bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Argabak (WA), Bellehelen (NV), Brier (NV), Chinabutte (ID), Clovercreek (OR), Duco (NV), Gwin (WA), Horseflat (WA), Ocud T (NV), Orhood (CA), Reywat (ID), Upatad (NV), and Windry (WA) series.

Argabak, Bellehelen, Brier, Horseflat, Ocud, and Orhood soils formed in igneous rock and have aridic moisture regimes.

Duco soils formed in igneous rock, have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and have aridic moisture regimes.

Chinabutte soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and formed in igneous rock.

Clovercreek soils formed in greenstone parent material.

Gwin and Windry soils formed in igneous rock.

Reywat soils have 24 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, formed in igneous rock, and have aridic moisture regimes.

Upatad soils formed in igneous rock and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shepridge soils.
