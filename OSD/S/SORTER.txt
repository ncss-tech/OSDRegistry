SORTER SERIES

The Sorter series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid-Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Runoff is high.  Permeability is slow. These soils remain saturated with aquic conditions for long periods, especially during the winter and spring months.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in forest.  Some areas have been cleared for pasture. Native vegetation includes lobolly and shortleaf pine and water oak, willow oak, red oak, and sweetgum.  Understory includes blackgum, post oak, yaupon, persimmon, wax myrtle, American elm, and American beautyberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana; LRR T; The Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B); series of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Montgomery County, Texas; 1975.

REMARKS: The Sorter series was redescribed in 1997 to reflect the change in Soil Taxonomy with the addition of the Vermaqualfs great group. 

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in) (A horizon)

Vermic feature: over 50 percent crayfish bioturbation (Bg and Btg/Eg1 horizons)

Argillic horizon: 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 in) (Btg/Eg horizons)

Natric horizon: Exchangeable sodium percentage of more than 7 in the particle-size control section.

Glossic horizon: 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 in) (Btg/Eg horizons. The glossic horizon is series criteria but is not diagnostic for classification.)
