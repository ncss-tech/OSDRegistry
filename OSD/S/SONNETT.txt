SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Custer County, Montana, 1995.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1394.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 6 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon that is the particle-size control section from 6 to 20 inches (Bt, Btk horizons); accumulations of calcium carbonates and gypsum from 25 to 60 inches (Bky1, Bky2, Bky3 horizons).  Sonnett soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

A preferred classification is Aridic Eutroboralfs.  A proposal adding this subgroup has been submitted.
