SWEETWEED SERIES

The Sweetweed series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic mudflow breccia. These soils are on mountains, hills and lahars. Slopes are 8 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.
