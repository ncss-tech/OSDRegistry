SPINTH SERIES

The Spinth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Spinth soils are on alluvial flats or flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C (38 degrees F).
