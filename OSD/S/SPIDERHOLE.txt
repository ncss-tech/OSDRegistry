SPIDERHOLE SERIES

The Spiderhole series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff or basalt.  Spiderhole soils are on plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Simpark series. Simpark soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and do not have upper subhorizons of the duripan which are weakly to strongly cemented.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Spiderhole soils are on plateaus and hills.  These soils formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff or basalt.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,385 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brace, Snakepit, and Wiskan soils.  Brace soils are fine-loamy and moderately deep to thin duripans over lithic contacts.  Snakepit soils are sandy, moderately deep to non-indurated duripans, have mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent depressions.  Wiskan soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts and occur on adjacent hills and escarpments.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Spiderhole soils are used for livestock grazing.  The present vegetation varies with surface texture phase.  The loamy sand phase supports basin big sagebrush and needleandthread.  The sandy loam phase supports Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
