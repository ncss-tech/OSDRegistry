SPURLOCK SERIES

The Spurlock series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy eolian sediments.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

Depth to secondary carbonates: 10 to 18 cm (4 to 7 in) 
Depth to calcic horizon: 13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 in) 
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils include the Conlen, Flomot, Tulia, and Veal series. 
Conlen soils: have darker colors in the surface horizon. 
Flomot, Tulia and Veal soils: have mean annual soil temperatures above 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).  In addition, Veal soils do not have an argillic horizon.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. 
Landform: gently sloping uplands, generally along drainageways or valleys. 
Slopes: 0 to 9 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation: 381 to 432 mm (15 to 17 in) 
Frost-free period: 165 to 185 days. 
Elevation: 1,128 to 1,707 m (3,700 to 5,600 ft) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Pastura and Sunray series.
Pastura soils: are on similar and lower landscape positions and have a petrocalcic horizons within 51 cm (20 in) of the surface. 
Sunray soils: are on similar landscape positions and have darker colors in the surface horizon and have mixed mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderately permeable.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes and medium on 5 to 9 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland and wildlife habitat but also used as cropland.  Principal crops grown are wheat, grain sorghum and forage sorghum.  Climax vegetation in rangeland is mainly mid grasses and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama and buffalograss with lesser amounts of western wheatgrass, galleta, silver bluestem and prairieclover.  This soil has been correlated to the High Lime (R077BY722TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains north of Canadian River in Texas, northeastern New Mexico and the western panhandle of Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.
