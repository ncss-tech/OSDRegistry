SPURLOCK SERIES

The Spurlock series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy, calcareous eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping plains, interfluves, and playa rims in the Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A).  The slope range is 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Aridic Calciustepts
