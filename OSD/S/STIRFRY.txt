STIRFRY SERIES

The Stirfry series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in drainageways of a lava plateau.  These soils formed in mossy organic material over volcanic ash and pumice.  Stirfry soils have moderately rapid permeability.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Karheen and Yamsay series.  Karheen soils have very gravelly and extremely gravelly textures below a depth of about 10 inches.  Yamsay soils contain layers of diatomaceous or coprogenous earth within the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape - lava plateau

Landform - drainageways 

Elevation - 4,100 to 6,500 feet

Slope - 0 to 15 percent

Parent material - mossy organic material over volcanic ash and pumice from Mt. Mazama

Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 43 degrees F

Mean January air temperature - 25 to 27 degrees F

Mean July air temperature - 57 to 60 degrees F 

Mean annual precipitation - 25 to 70 inches

Frost-free period - 0 to 50 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lapine, Cosbie, Mariel and Mesquito soils.  Lapine soils are on adjacent plateaus.  They formed in volcanic ash and pumice, are excessively drained and have a xeric moisture regime.  Cosbie soils occur interspersed with Stirfry soils.  They have layers of limnic soil material, diatomaceous earth with n Values greater than 0.7 and lack histic epipedons.  Mesquito soils are in nearby flood plains.  They have layers with greater than 60 percent basalt cobbles, stones or boulders beginning at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Mariel soils are dominated by hemic organic soil material.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - very poorly drained

Permeability - moderately rapid

Flooding - none

Ponding - none

Water table - an apparent water table is at its uppermost limit from January to December

USE AND VEGETATION:  Stirfry soils are used for wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The potential natural plant community is the lodgepole pine/bog blueberry/widefruit sedge plant association (CLM3-12).  The hummocks or micro-highs, have a folistic epipedon, are considered part of the potential natural plant community.  The bog blueberry/fewflower spikerush plant association (SW41-12) is a seral community.  This seral community is supported in positions where hummocks or micro-highs are widely dispersed or absent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 6 and 3.  Series is of small extent.
