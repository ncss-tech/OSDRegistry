SATTRE SERIES

The Sattre series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy alluvium and the underlying sandy and gravelly sediments. These soils are on outwash areas and on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bremer County, Iowa, 1965.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 43 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 43 centimeters (Ap, E, and BE horizons); 
argillic horizon--the zone from 43 to 89 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Differentia between Sattre series and Meridian series needs further study.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
