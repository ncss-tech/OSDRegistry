COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sheepsprings soils are on floodplains. These soils formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash, and alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,340 to 1,370 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost free season is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Zola soils. Zola soils are fine-loamy and have Bk horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained, wet at or near the surface in spring, fall, and winter, low runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity, 

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly baltic rush and tufted hairgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Oregon; the soil is of small extent. MLRA 25.
