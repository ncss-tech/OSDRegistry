SODHOUSE SERIES

The Sodhouse series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Sodhouse soils are on fan remnants and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sodhouse stony very fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel.

(15 to 112 cm thick)

    2Bk--107 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; secondary carbonates segregated as common pendants on rock fragments; strongly effervescent; 60 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Humboldt County, Nevada; about 3 miles south of Golconda; about 2,300 feet east and 1,850 feet south of the northwest corner of section 17, T. 35 N., R. 40 E.; USGS Pole Creek 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 54 minutes 40 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 30 minutes 5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.9111111 latitude,  -117.5013889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in winter and spring, dry from June through November; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to indurated duripan: 36 to 50 cm.
Duripan thickness: 15 to 112 cm.
Depth to 2Bk or 2Bqk horizon: 64 to more than 150 cm.

Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Garhill, Tybo, and Univega series.

Garhill soils are 30 to 76 cm deep to lithic contacts.  Tybo soils are calcareous throughout, lack cambic horizons that extend below 25 cm, and are intermittently moist during summer months.  Univega soils have nongravelly Bw horizons and are intermittently moist during summer months.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sodhouse soils are on fan remnants and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Knoss, Oxcorel, and Orovada soils.  Knoss soils are clayey and have natric horizons.  Oxcorel soils are fine, very deep, have natric horizons, and have horizons with durinodes.  Orovada are coarse-loamy, very deep, and have horizons with durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sodhouse soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 24, 25, and 28B.
