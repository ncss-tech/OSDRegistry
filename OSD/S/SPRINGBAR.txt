SPRINGBAR SERIES

The Springbar series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff. Springbar soils are on spits and longshore bars of relict lake shores. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Xeric Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Springbar sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

TYPE LOCATION: White Pine County, Nevada; 4.5 miles southwest of Minerva, west of Atlanta Road and 50 feet south of South Highland Road; about 1900 feet south and 1500 feet east of the northwest corner of section 34, T. 11 N., R. 67 E.; USGS Minerva 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 46 minutes 30 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 26 minutes 34 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative in July and August due to summer convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 28 to 46 cm.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent

Particle-size control section: Clay content: 2 to 8 percent. 
Rock fragments: 5 to 30 percent.

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Clay content: 8 to 15 percent.
Rock fragments: 5 to 15 percent, mainly gravel.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 2 percent.

Bk horizon

Calcium carbonate equivalent: less than 5 percent.

Bqk horizons
Value: 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 or 2, dry or moist.
Texture: Stratified, averages very gravelly sand or very gravelly coarse sand; individual strata range from gravelly loamy fine sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand.
Clay content: 2 to 5 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 25 to 35 percent, individual strata range from 15 to 65 percent.
Reaction: Strongly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.

Calcium carbonate equivalent: less than 5 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Davey, Fortbois and Timmerman series. Davey soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not receive summer moisture. Fortbois series have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not receive summer moisture. Timmerman soils do not receive summer moisture and are formed in glacial outwash and alluvium mixed with loess.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Springbar soils are on spits and longshore bars of relict lake shores. These soils formed from mixed alluvium derived mainly from welded tuff. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,590 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Katelana, Kawich, Kunzler and Medburn soils.  Katelana soils are fine-silty. Kawich soils occur on dunes and are sandy throughout. Kunzler soils have calcic horizons containing durinodes. Medburn soils are coarse-loamy and lack soil structure development.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; negligible through medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Springbar soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
