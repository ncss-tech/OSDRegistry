SINNIGAM SERIES

The Sinnigam series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from non-calcareous argillaceous sandstone, siltstone and shale.  These soils are on bedrock-floored plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argiustolls  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sinnigam very stony clay loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; dark gray (10YR 4/1) coating on peds; strong very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many fine and very fine pores and common medium pores; 25 percent channers and cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots and common medium roots; many fine and very fine pores and common medium pores; 35 percent channers and cobbles, 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons is 4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--6 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very stony clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many fine and very fine pores and common medium pores; continuous faint coating of unstained sand grains on faces of peds; many distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent channers and cobbles, 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt2--11 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely stony clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; many fine and very fine pores and few medium pores; many distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent channers and cobbles, 25 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    R--17 inches; fractured hard sandstone; some weathering in upper few inches and with a root mat formed at contact; clay films on some fragments in upper 3 inches.
