STEPOFF SERIES

The Stepoff series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum from granitic and metamorphic rock.  The Stepoff soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stepoff soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 2,000 to 4,900 feet.  They formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic and metamorphic rock with a mantle of volcanic ash on slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches and the frost free season is 50 to 110 days (9 years in 10 to 1 year in 10 respectively).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bouldercreek, Brodeer, Flumecreek, Rettig and Township soils.  Brodeer soils are on mountain slopes and have an argillic horizon.  Bouldercreek, Flumecreek and Township soils are on mountain slopes and are skeletal.  Rettig soils are on mountain slopes and are paramicaceous.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:   Well drained;  moderate permeability and slow to moderate runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for wildlife habitat and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is sitka alder with an understory of miners lettuce, lady fern, wild ginger, bracken fern, false bugbane, arrowleaf groundsel, trillium, coolwort foamflower, and pioneer violet.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho, Stepoff soils are not extensive.
