STINGDORN SERIES

The Stingdorn series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from rhyolite, andesite and tuff.  These soils are on crests and side slopes of foothills, hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Stingdorn very cobbly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

     Bt1--18 to 28 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on ped faces and lining pores; 5 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 28 cm thick)

     Bt2--28 to 38 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores, common distinct clay films on faces of peds and many distinct clay films lining pores; 5 percent indurated pan fragments; 5 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    Bkqm--38 to 50 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) indurated duripan; pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; several thin indurated horizontal lamella at intervals throughout strongly silica-cemented matrix; 2 to 5 mm thick indurated laminar cap covers the bedrock; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0.6 to 15 cm thick)

    R--50 cm; unweathered tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 42 miles southwest of Battle Mountain; about 1,400 feet north and 1,500 east of the southwest corner section 31. T. 26 N., R. 41 E.; USGS Home Station Gap; latitude  40 degrees 04 minutes 36 seconds N and longitude  117 degrees  25 minutes 01 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.0766667 latitude, -117.4169444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, but moist for short periods in the winter and spring, dry May through October; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Combine thickness of A and Bt horizons: 18 to 40 cm.
Depth to indurated duripan over hard bedrock: 20 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent 
Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Consistence:  Soft or slightly hard dry.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.

Bt horizons
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Clay content:  Averages 27 to 35 percent.  Some subhorizons of some pedons slightly less.
Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles.
Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard dry; very friable or friable moist.  Reaction:  Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.
Carbonates:  Slightly to strongly effervescent in some pedons. The upper part of the Bt horizon is noneffervescent in some pedons.

Bkq horizons (when present)
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  6, 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lyda, Maggie, Silverbow, Tokoper and Tomel series.  

Lyda, Maggie, Silverbow, and Tomel soils lack bedrock within a depth of 50 cm.  Tokoper soils average 18 to 28 percent clay in the argillic horizon and are moistened intermittently for 10 to 20 days by summer precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stingdorn soils are on smooth hillsides and tilted plateaus.  The soils formed in rhyolitic residuum with an admixture of colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 2,135 meters. The climate is cool, arid with a mean annual precipitation of 125 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to l20 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Singatse and Fireball soils.  Singatse soils lack a duripan and an argillic horizon.  Fireball soils are more than 50 cm deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, rabbitbrush, littltleaf horsebrush and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  Stingdorn soils are of small extent. MLRA 24 and 27.
