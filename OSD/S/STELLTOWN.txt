STELLTOWN SERIES

The Stelltown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in thick beds of sandy loam Cretaceous Age marine deposits. They are on interfluves of the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, thermic Aquic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Stelltown fine sandy loam in an area of pasture.

	A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy loam; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles, weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and common very fine roots; fragments of sandstone make up 5% by volume; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

	E--15 to 28 cm (6 to 11 in); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy loam; few medium distinct olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) mottles; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron accumulation on surfaces along root channels; fine and medium distinct light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) iron depletions; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine, few fine, and few medium roots; fragments of sandstone make up 5% by volume; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

	Bt1--28 to 69 cm (11 to 27 in); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) iron accumulations, common fine and medium prominent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; light brownish gray(10YR 6/2) iron depletions on surfaces along root channels; moderate medium and moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine and fine, very few medium roots; few patchy clay films; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

	Bt2--69 to 104 cn (27 to 41 in); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy loam; few medium faint yellowish red (5YR 5/6) iron accumulations on faces of peds, many medium prominent gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions along ped seams; few fine black(10YR 2/1) manganese accumulations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few very fine and fine roots; common distinct clay films on seams; about 4 percent plinthite; very strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. 

	Bt3--104 to 203 cm (41 to 80 in); mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), gray (10YR 6/1), and red (2.5YR 4/8); sandy clay loam; about 4 percent plinthite; moderate medium and coarse angular blocky structure; firm; few very fine and fine roots; few distinct clay films on ped faces; 20 percent plinthite; 5 to 10 percent by volume brittle masses; very strongly acid

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Munden series.
Munden soils have a solum thickness between 64 to 127 cm (25 and 50 in). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stelltown soils are on nearly level to sloping interfluves of the Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. The soil formed in marine deposits consisting of thick beds of sandy loams. The mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 16 degrees C (58 to 60 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1193 to 1448 mm (47 to 57 in). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the McCaskill, Peanutrock, Pikecity and Smithton series.
McCaskill soils are on similar landscapes and are somewhat poorly drained.
Peanutrock soils have a loamy-skeletal family control section.
Pikecity soils are on similar landscapes and have a fine-loamy family control section.
Smithton soils are slightly lower in the landscape and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow to medium runoff and moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is in forest of loblolly, shortleaf, and slash pines. The understory is American beauty berry, and native grass species plants. Cleared areas are used for pasture, hay, corn, and soybeans. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain (MLRA 135B) of Arkansas and possibly Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.
