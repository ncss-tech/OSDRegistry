SELOW SERIES 

The Selow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed lacustrine and eolian deposits.  These soils are on dissected lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, illitic, frigid Typic Natrixeralfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Selow silt loam, in pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots and common medium roots; many fine and very fine discontinuous tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick) 

    Btn-8 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and plastic; many fine roots and few medium roots; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; many prominent clay films on ped faces and in pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    Btnk--14 to 20 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and plastic; common fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common masses of lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

    2Bk--20 to 28 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick) 

    2C--28 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; disseminated lime; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1987. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1112.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the surface to 8 inches (Ap horizon); a natric horizon from 8 to 20 inches (Btn, Btnk horizons); accumulation of lime from 14 to 28 inches (Btnk, 2Bk horizons).  A particle-size control section from 8 to 14 inches (Btn, Btnk horizons).  Selow soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.
