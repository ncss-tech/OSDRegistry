SLAUGHTER SERIES

The Slaughter series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loamy and clayey eolian sediments over a layer of indurated caliche which is underlain by loamy calcareous material derived from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Slaughter soils are on broad, smooth, nearly level to very gently sloping plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 456 mm (18 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Petrocalcic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:Slaughter loam, on southwest facing, nearly level plain, 0.5 percent slope in native rangeland at an elevation of about 1,127 m (3,698 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

(Thickness is 10 to 20 cm [4 to 8 in].)

 Bt--17 to 42 cm (7 to 17 in); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; many fine and medium roots throughout; 50 percent prominent clay films on vertical faces of peds; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (Thickness is 10 to 40 cm [4 to 16 in].)

 Bkkm--42 to 100 cm (17 to 39 in) cemented material; Laminar cap 2-5 mm thick, lateral continuity 10 to 20 cm, brecciated with pisolitic structure; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (Thickness is 40 to 80 cm [16 to 32 in].)

 2BCkk--100 to 203 cm (39 to 80 in) very gravelly loam, 45 percent 2 to 75 mm nonflat subangular indurated petrocalcic fragments. 55 percent calcium carbonate as nodules, masses and finely disseminated; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.
