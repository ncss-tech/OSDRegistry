SUEREDO SERIES


Sueredo consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra over till from volcanic rocks. Sueredo soils are on ground moraines in the Southern Cascade mountains.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Doe, Grenet, Kusu, Natkim, Pettijohn, Roundknoll, Stices, Twelvemile and Yallani soils. The Grenet soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. The Kusu soils are deep to a lithic contact. The Doe and Pettijohn soils have a cambic horizon, lack a densic horizon and have a oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 Fe of 1 to 2 percent in the ash mantle. The Natkim soils have a cambic horizon, lack a densic contact and are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days. The Roundknoll soils have a calcic horizon and are slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout. The Stices soils have a cambic horizon, lack a densic contact and have 60 to 80 percent glass in the upper particle-size control section. The Twelvemile soils have a cambic horizon, lack a densic contact, have 50 to 70 percent glass in the particle-size control section. The Yallani soils have a cambic horizon, lack a densic contact and have an oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 Fe of 2 to 3 percent in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Sueredo soils are on ground moraines in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. These soils formed in 1100 year old tephra from Chaos Crags over till from volcanic rocks. Elevation is 5640 to 7440 feet (1119 to 2268 m). Mean annual precipitation is 41 to 91 inches (1041 to 2311 mm). The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F ( 4.5 to 6.5 degrees C). Frost free season is 60 to 85 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cragwash and Scoured soils. The Cragwash soils are deep to a duripan and are on outwash plains. The Scoured soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on convex glacially scoured bedrock positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid to rapid in the A horizon, moderate to very rapid in the C horizon, moderately rapid to very rapid in the 2Ab and 2Bwb horizons, rapid to very rapid in the 2C horizon, and slow to very slow in the 2Cdq horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is white fir, Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, greenleaf manzanita and snowbrush ceanothus, with some California red fir and western white pine at higher elevations.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B Southern Cascade Mountains
