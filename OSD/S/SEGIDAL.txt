REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Albic horizon--zone from 3 to 53 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 53 to 127 cm
*Cemented layer--zone from 74 to 127 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 28 to 103 cm

The classification of this series was changed from coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, ortstein Typic Epiaquods to coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, ortstein Typic Duraquods based on the continuously cemented Bsm horizon. The laboratory data does not support the Bs or Bsm horizons as spodic material (pH too high and organic carbon too low); therefore, the classification was changed to Typic Petraquepts.
