SIMPER SERIES

The Simper series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on dissected fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the avergae annual precipitaion is 13 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Simper gravelly loam - on a 5 percent slopes, rangeland.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Bkq--34 to 41 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, carbonates occur in filaments and are disseminated; strongly discontinuous cementation by silica and carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk--41 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard to soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium, fine and few very fine pores; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, carbonates occur in filaments and are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 8 inches.  This horizon exceeds 7 inches in thickness and is greater than one third its depth to carbonates. (A1 and A2 horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone of clay accumulation from 8 to 21 inches.  (Bt and Btk horizons)

Duripan - the zone of silica cementation from 21 to 41 inches with indurated cap. (Bkqm1 and Bkqm2 horizons)

Particle size control section - the zone from 8 to 21 inches.

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998".  The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data.
