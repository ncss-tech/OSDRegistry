SURPUR SERIES

The Surpur series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated tectonically uplifted fluvial, beach, and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. Surpur soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: At this time there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Surpur soils occur on ridges and upper, mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 233 to 690 meters (760 to 2260 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated tectonically uplifted fluvial, beach, and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mettah and the Ossagon soils. Mettah soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ossagon soils have an umbric epipedon. The Mettah soils are found on silty marine and non-marine sediments. The Ossagon soils are found at lower elevations and closer to the coast.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber and is used for recreation, wildlife and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of redwood, Douglas fir, western hemlock, tanoak, California huckleberry, Pacific rhododendron, salal, and western swordfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
