SHIVELYFLAT SERIES

The Shivelyflat series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. Shivelyflat soils are on flood-plain steps in mountain river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1525 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Shivelyflat soils are on linear to slightly concave positions on flood-plain steps in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 18 to 170 meters. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1015 to 1780 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 300 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cottoneva (CA), Eelriver (CA), and Pepperwood (CA) soils. Cottoneva and Eelriver occur are under native redwood forest where the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is less than 6 degrees C. Cottoneva and Pepperwood soils have greater than 15 percent particles 0.1 mm or coarser. Cottoneva and Pepperwood soils occur on linear to slightly convex positions on floodplain steps and natural levees. Eelriver soils occur on the same positions as Shivelyflat soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soils are rarely flooded for very brief periods December through February. The soils frequently have 1 to 3 cm of ponding for very brief periods December through March.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for pasture and hay with small areas used for orchards, vineyards, and non-irrigated truck crops. Uncultivated vegetation includes wild oat, soft chess, ripgut brome, medusahead, dogtail grass, pennyroyal, and various other forbs. These soils once supported redwood. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt, MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt County, South Part. California, 2010. The name is from Shively Flat.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1. Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 78 centimeters. (Ap horizons)
2. Particle size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters averages 19 percent clay and 12 percent fine sand or coarser. (Ap2, Ap3, C1 horizons)
3. Aquic feature: The zone from 43 to 200 centimeters (Ap2, Ap3, C1, C2, C3, C4 horizons)

The series type location was moved in 2009 to better reflect the series concepts.
