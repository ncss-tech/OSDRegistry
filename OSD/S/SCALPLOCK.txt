SCALPLOCK SERIES 

The Scalplock series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metasedimentary rock.  These soils are on mountain slopes and cirque headwalls. Slopes are 8 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,825 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Scapegoat gravelly silt loam, grassland. This profile was described on an 8 percent slope at 2,128 meters in elevation. (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted) 

    A--0 to 8 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw1--8 to 19 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2--19 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 55 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    R--38 cm; fractured hard metasedimentary bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability (10 to 100 um/sec). 

USE AND VEGETATION: Scalplock soils are used mainly for recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is dominantly by an overstory of subalpine fir, and the understory is primarily pinegrass, arrowleaf groundsel, Hitchcock's woodrush, and leafy aster. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Scalplock soils are of small extent in northwestern Montana. MLRA 43A and 43B.
