STOUGH SERIES

The Stough series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that occur on stream terraces and interfluves. They formed in loamy sediments of fluvial or marine origin. Slopes ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1422 millimeters (56 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).
