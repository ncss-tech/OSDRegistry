SUNBURST SERIES

The Sunburst series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till.  These soils are on till plains, hills, moraines, and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, frigid Torrertic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sunburst clay, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 13 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine pores; many fine and very fine roots; few small pebbles; few masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--13 to 26 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine pores; many fine and very fine roots; few coarse masses and films of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual boundary. (10 to 26 inches thick)

    Bky--26 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, dark olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse blocky structure in upper part and thick platy in lower part; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine pores and roots; few lignite chips and few small pebbles; few coarse masses of lime; strongly effervescent; many fine nests and seams of gypsum; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sunburst soils are used mainly for range, a few areas are cultivated.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, blue grama, and threadleaf sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Sunburst soil are moderately extensive throughout most of the counties of the till plains of northern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Glacier County, Montana, 1969.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0239.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed) (A, Bk1 horizons); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation (Bk1, Bk2, Bky horizons); a horizon with gypsum accumulations (Bky horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and Bky horizons).  Sunburst soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
