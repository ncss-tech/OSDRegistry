SMITHLAND SERIES

The Smithland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains and upland drainageways. These soils formed in alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters (28 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ackmore, Colo, Kennebec, Nodaway, and Zook soils.
Ackmore--are in landform positions similar to those of the Smithland soils, have an ochric epipedon 13 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches thick), and have buried horizons
Colo--are in similar landscape positions as Smithland soils and have a saturated zone within a depth of 0.3 meters (1 foot) during March to June in most years
Kennebec--are in the slightly higher elevations and have a saturated zone between depths of 0.91 to 1.83 meters (3 to 6 feet) during April to June in most years
Nodaway--are in the slightly higher elevations, have an ochric epipedon 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches) thick, and have a saturated zone between depths of 0.91 to 1.83 meters (3 to 6 feet) during April to June in most years
Zook--are in the lower elevations, have a clay content of 35 to 44 percent in the particle-size control section, and have a saturated zone within a depth of 0.3 meters (1 foot) during March to June in most years

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.3 to 0.91 meters (1 to 3 feet) during March to June in most years and is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: 1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second
Flooding--rare to occasional flooding with very brief or brief duration during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains and hay. A few areas are in permanent pasture with widely spaced willow and cottonwood trees. The native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR M, MLRAs 102B and 107; western Iowa and possibly eastern Nebraska and northwestern Missouri. This series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A1, A2, A3, and Bg horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, A3, Bg, BCg, and Cg horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 127 centimeters (50 inches) (Ap, A1, A2, A3, Bg, and BCg horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 86 to 127 centimeters (34 to 50 inches) (Bg and BCg horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Few to common, high chroma redoximorphic concentrations are at depths below 61 centimeters (24 inches).

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
