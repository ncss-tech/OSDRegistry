SLAN SERIES

The Slan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and conglomerate. The Slan soils are on terrace sideslopes, hillsides and mountainsides.  Slopes are 10 to 65 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Slan very gravelly loam, rangeland - on a convex south-facing slope of 50 percent at an elevation of 7,140 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--5 to 18 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) gravelly loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (noneffervescent in areas of clay films); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (11 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk--18 to 25 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) gravelly loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; common 1 to 3 mm soft massis of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    BC--25 to 32 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--32 to 60 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) weathered Wasatch sandstone, crushing to sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  
Cokeville (T)  are 40 to 60 inches to paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Slan soils are on terrace sideslopes, hillsides, and mountainsides.  These soils formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum from sandstone and conglomerate.  Slopes are 10 to 65 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,700 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The average annual temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boundridge (T), Pontuge (T), and Warshod (T) soils.  Boundridge soils have a mollic epipedon, are skeletal and have a duripan on terrace summits.  Pontuge soils have a pachic epipedon and are very deep.  Warshod soils have a pachic epipedon, lack an argillic horizon, are skeletal and are very deep.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  Native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast, Idaho.  These soils are of small extent. MLRA 43B.
