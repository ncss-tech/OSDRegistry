SANBORN SERIES

The Sanborn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in calcareous, stratified loamy and sandy alluvium on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sanborn loam with a 1 percent slope in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 14; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches) thick)

  AC--13 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; thin strata of loamy fine sand; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 49; strong effervescence; very strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 36 (2 to 14 inches) thick)

  Cg1--25 to 64 centimeters (10 to 25 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; common fine distinct dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) iron masses; thin strata of fine sandy loam; massive; slightly hard, very friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 44; strong effervescence; very strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

  Cg2--64 to 102 centimeters (25 to 40 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; many fine and medium prominent light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) iron masses; thin strata of loam; massive; soft, very friable; sodium adsorption ratio = 33; strong effervescence; very strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

  Cg3--102 to 127 centimeters (40 to 50 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; many fine and medium prominent light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) iron masses; thin strata of loam; single grain; loose; sodium adsorption ratio = 2; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

  Cg4--127 to 152 centimeters (50 to 80 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) sand; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; many fine and medium prominent light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) iron masses; single grain; loose; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Dundy County, Nebraska, about 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) west of Benkelman; 610 meters (2000 feet) north and 91 meters (300 feet) east of the southwest corner of Section 24, T.1 N., R.38 W.  USGS Benkelman topographic quadrangle, latitude 40 degrees, 2 minutes, 15 seconds North and longitude 101 degrees, 34 minutes, 5 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Carbonates: 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches)   
Electrical conductivity: 0 to 8 throughout the control section  
Depth to redoximorphic features: less than 51 centimeters (20 inches)

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 or 6, and 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 Horizon values of 5.5, or 3.5 moist are less than 7 inches thick Texture: loam or very fine sandy loam   
Reaction: slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline 
Sodium adsorption ratio: 5 to 20

AC and Cg horizons:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7, and 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3  
Textures: fine sandy loam, loam, and very fine sandy loam
Texture below 102 centimeters (40 inches):  Fine sand, sand, and coarse sand 
Thin strata of loamy material common in the C horizon  
Reaction: strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the sandy lower part
Sodium adsoption ratio: 15 to 60 in the upper part and 0 to 5 in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the McGrew series.  
McGrew has gravelly sand within 60 inches and flooding frequency is occasional. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: on flood plains  
Parent material: calcareous, stratified loamy and sandy alluvium
Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent
Average annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches)
Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 12 degrees C. (51 to 53 degrees F.)
Frost free days: 140 to 160 days per year

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bolent, Calamus, and Otero soils.  
Bolent and Calamus soils have a sandy particle size control section.  
Bolent soils are lower on the landscape.  
Calamus soils are on similar landscapes.  
Otero soils have a seasonal high water table below a depth of 2 meters (6 feet) and are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained  
Runoff: low  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high  
Depth to the seasonal high water table: 46 to 91 centimeters (1.5 to 3.0 feet)
Flooding: rarely 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is in rangeland.  
The climax vegetation consists mainly of alkali sacaton, inland saltgrass, switchgrass, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Nebraska and possibly northeastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas.
