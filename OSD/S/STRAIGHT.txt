STRAIGHT SERIES

The Straight series consists of moderately deep well drained
soils formed in colluvium.  They are on uplands and have slopes
of 12 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Straight very cobbly loam, forested.  (Colors are
for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

O1--2 to 1 inches; loose litter of undecomposed limbs, twigs, needles, cones and leaves.

O2--1 inch to 0; partially decomposed twigs, needles and
leaves.

A--0 to 5 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) very gravelly
loam, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular and moderate very fine subangular blocky structure;
soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine to medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; few black concretions; 25 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

Bw1--5 to 12 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) very
gravelly loam, light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) dry; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic;
common very fine to medium roots; many very fine and fine pores;
few black concretions; 40 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.9); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

Bw2--12 to 25 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very gravelly
loam, light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) dry; weak and moderate fine
and very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable,
nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine to coarse roots; many
very fine and fine pores; 40 percent gravel and 20 percent
cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

Cr--25 inches; semiconsolidated and partially weathered
reddish breccia bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Oregon; SW1/4NE1/4 sec. 34, T. 28
S., R. 1 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature
ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but
are dry in the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days
during the summer and early fall.  Depth to a paralithic contact
and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the control section range from 35 to 75 percent, ranging from 25 to
50 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Hue is 5YR or 2.5YR.  The solum ranges from loam to clay loam and averages 10 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon
has moderate fine to medium granular or very fine subangular
blocky structure.  It has 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 25 to 75 percent gravel.

The B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR moist, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR
dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and
dry.  It is loam or clay loam with 35 to 75 percent rock
fragments and 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has weak or moderate granular and subangular blocky structure.  In some pedons most of
the rock fragments are partially weathered.  It is very gravelly
loam or clay loam or very cobbly clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Atring, Baldhill, Beekman,
Clallam, Farber, Geppert, Hartless, Inskip, Kanid, Kandig,
Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron, Terbies, Vena and Woodin series.
Atring soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F.  Baldhill soils have 2 to 10 percent clay in the textural control section and are over 40
inches deep.  The Beekman, Inskip, Mayacama, Neuns, Sheetiron,
Vena and Woodin soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic
contact.  Farber, Hartless, Kanid, Kandig and Terbies soils are
over 40 inches deep.  Clallam soils have less than 18 percent
clay in the textural control section and have hue of 10YR to 5Y
in the solum.  Geppert soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the control section and coarse fragments are cobble size.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Straight soils are on uplands at elevations
of 1,500 to 4,000 feet; slopes are 12 to 80 percent.  The soils
are formed in colluvium weathered from reddish breccia and
andesite.  They have a subhumid climate with dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The
frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dumont, Shippa
and Zing soils.  Dumont soils are deep soils with fine-textured argillic horizons.  Zing soils are deep moderately well drained
soils with fine-textured argillic horizons.  Shippa soils are 10
to 20 inches to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production, recreation, wildlife, and water supply.  Present vegetation dominantly is
Douglas fir, sugar pine, white fir, western hemlock, and Pacific dogwood with an understory of cascade Oregongrape, common
snowberry and whipplevine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The west side of central-southern
Cascade Mountains, Oregon.  The series is of moderate extent.
