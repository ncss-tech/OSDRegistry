SAGECREEK SERIES

The Sagecreek series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  These soils occur on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sagecreek loam - grassland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

     A--0 to 4 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; calcareous; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2 (cresol red); gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

     Btk--4 to 16 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure that parts to moderate coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly plastic, slightly sticky; few thin glossy patches on some ped faces and weak glossy coatings on the inside of some root channels; 10 percent gravel with small pendants of calcium carbonate on the under side of gravel in the lower part of this horizon; calcareous; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2 (cresol red); diffuse wavy boundary.  (4 to 37 inches thick)

     Bk--16 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly plastic, slightly sticky; 10 percent gravel; continuous accumulation of visible secondary carbonate as concretions, in thin seams and streaks, and as coatings on the gravel fragments; calcareous; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4 (thymol blue)

TYPE LOCATION:  Carbon County, Wyoming.  SE1/4, SE1/4, Sec. 35, T19N, R88W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by peaks periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  Typic aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  about 46 degrees F
Mean summer soil temperature:  about 64 degrees F
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate:  3 to 30 inches
Depth to cambic horizon: 3 to 6 inches 

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
  Clay content:  18 to 35 percent
  Sand content:  20 to 55 percent with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand
  Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent gravel

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR to 5Y
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4 dry or moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  4 to 14 percent
Gypsum:  0 to 3 percent
ESP:  0 to 15
Reaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline

Btk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR to 5Y
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  1 to 6 dry or moist
Texture:  loam or clay loam
Clay content:  18 to 35 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  4 to 14 percent
Gypsum:  0 to 5 percent
ESP:  0 to 15
Reaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline
NoteIt is assumed that this horizon does not have the necessary clay increase to qualify as an argillic horizon.

Bk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR to 5Y
Clay content:  18 to 35 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  4 to 14 percent
Gypsum:  0 to 5 percent
ESP:  0 to 15
Reaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no current competitors in this family.  Similar and related series include the Kinnear and Unson series. The Kinnear soils are sandier and have soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.  the Unson series are sandier and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks
Landform:  nearly level to sloping alluvial fans and terraces 
Slopes:  0 to 6 percent
Elevation: 6,800 to 7,200 feet
Mean annual temperature:  about 42 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  about 7 inches at the type location with peak precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer
Frost-free period:  100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Forelle and Unson series.  The Forelle series differ in having an argillic horizon.  The Unson series differ in containing more than 35 percent coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid. Permeability is moderate to rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  They are used as native pastureland or as irrigated hayland.  Native vegetation includes big sage, cactus, thickspike wheatgrass, shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution limited to southern and western Wyoming.  Series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Sage Creek area, Carbon County, Wyoming, 1972.  Series name is taken from the name of a stream.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Btk and Bk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 16 inches.  (Btk horizon)
Other features:  The presence of secondary calcium carbonate in the zone from 4 to 60 inches.  (Btk and Bk horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

A paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Typic Camborthids to Typic Haplocambids.  Format and horizonation designations were updated.  The series has not been updated by the state since 1972.
