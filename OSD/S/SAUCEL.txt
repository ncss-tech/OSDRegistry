SAUCEL SERIES

The Saucel series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable, saline soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits derived from Holocene age sediments.  These nearly level soils are on the coastal plain adjacent to the tidal flats.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent, but mainly less than 0.5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, hyperthermic Typic Halaquepts
