SANDCREEK SERIES

The Sandcreek series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy eolian material from mixed sources influenced by local alluvium.  Sandcreek soils are on undulating basalt plains.  Permeability is very rapid.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sandcreek sand - on an east-facing slope of  1 percent under grass and shrub at 5,010 feet in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on June 11, 1981, the soil was moist below 4 inches.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 2 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

    AB--5 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 2 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--13 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) cobbly sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    2R--18 inches; vesicular basalt bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this classification.  Closely related soils are the Blacksan and Engett series.  These soils are deeper than 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sandcreek soils are on nearly level to undulating basalt plains at elevations of 4,900 to 5,450 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in sandy eolian material from mixed sources influenced by local alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  Average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Blacksan, Eginbench, Engett, Juniperbute, and St. Anthony soils.  Blacksan soils are moderately deep and are on convex positions.   Eginbench soils are on lower river terraces and have an induced water table.  Engett soils are deep or very deep and are found in concavities.  Juniperbute soils are adjacent to sand dunes and lack organic carbon to meet mollic criteria.  St. Anthony soils are on lower river terraces and are moderately deep to sand and gravel.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; runoff is slow; permeability is very rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used principally for rangeland with minor areas of soils cropped to irrigated small grains and potatoes.  Native vegetation is mainly Antelope bitterbrush and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are moderately extensive in southeast Idaho.
