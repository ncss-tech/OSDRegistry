COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape:  Northern Coastal Plain estuaries
Landform:  Estuarine channels, estuarine tidal creek channels, and mainland coves
Parent Material:  Fine, glauconitic estuarine deposits
Slope:  0 to 3 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature:  50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Water Depth Range:  0 to 14.8 feet (0 to 4.5 meters)
Water Regime:  Tidal, 0 to 1 foot (0 to 0.3 meters) tidal range
Water Salinity Range:  7 to 15 ppt

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Coards soils-contain sulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface and occur in MLRA 153D in coastal bays and lagoons with higher salinity ranges.
Contees Wharf soils (proposed)-occur on similar landforms but have a fine-silty particle size family class.
Rhode River soils (proposed)-occur on wave-cut platforms, saddles and shoals and have pre-Holocene materials within 100 cm of the soil surface.
Sand Point soils (proposed)--have sandy surface horizons and hyper-sulfidic materials within 100 centimeters of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous and peraquic soil moisture regime
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Low to moderately low
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water.  The presence of hypo-sulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air. 

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses:  Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture. 
Dominant Vegetation:  Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain estuaries of the western portion of Chesapeake Bay. MLRA 149A.  This series is of small extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Raleigh, North Carolina. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2018.

REMARKS:  This subaqueous series is named for Sellman Creek, which is a tributary to the Rhode River sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay.  Areas of Sellman soils were formerly included with water.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 22 centimeters (Ase horizon)
Peraquic feature-the zone from 0 to 163 centerimeters is permanently saturated
Hypo-sulfidic materials-the zone from 0 to 163 centimeters
