SLEDRUNNER SERIES

The Sledrunner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on escarpments, hills, landslides and eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Sledrunner silty clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 6 cm; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) silty clay loam, dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and common medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Btk1--6 to 58 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and common medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 75 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary.

    Btk2--58 to 105 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silty clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 75 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Btk1, Btk2 horizons - 60 to 135 cm)

    BCk1--105 to 135 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silty clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    BCk2--135 to 200 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silty clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3). (combined thickness of the BCk1, BCk2 horizons - greater than 80 cm)
