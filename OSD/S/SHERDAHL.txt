SHERDAHL SERIES

The Sherdahl series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on risers and treads of stream terraces in river valleys of the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills in MLRA 74. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F)

Grigston and Gibbon soils have a weighted clay percent average of 18 to 35 percent in the particle size control section and occur on flood plains right below the terrace break. 
Detroit soils have a weighted clay percent average greater than 35 percent in the particle size control section and occur on similar positions. 
Muir soils have a weighted clay percent average of 18 to 35 percent in the particle size control section and occur on similar positions.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated and much of it is irrigated. The main crops are corn, soybeans, alfalfa, and sorghum. The native grasses are big bluestem, switchgrass, little bluestem, and western wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Central Kansas. (LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 74 Central Kansas Sandstone Hills) The series is of small extent.

SERIES PROPOSED: Republic County, Kansas, 2008. 

REMARKS: 
The diagnostic horizons and characteristics recognized in this soil are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 29 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) (Ap and A horizons) 
Secondary Carbonates: 104 to 200 centimeters (42 to 80 inches) (2Bkb1, 2Bkb2, 2Bkb3 and 2Bkb4 horizons) 
Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Ab horizon; 84 centimeters (34 inches)
 
There has been discussion of whether these soils are well drained or moderately well drained, because redoximorphic concentrations can be found within 100 centimeters. These could be caused by irrigation. The majority of these areas are irrigated and treated like well drained soils instead of moderately well drained soils. It was decided to call them well drained because of that. 

Usually the buried paleosol is similar to a Muir soil, but sometimes it is similar to a Detroit soil. 

Keys to soil Taxonomy: Eleventh edition, 2010 

This soil was set up to take the place of the Eudora series that was mapped in the terrace position of the Republican River, in north central Kansas.
