SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska; 2020

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 27 to 102 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--Bw horizon
*Free carbonates--2C2 horizon
Soils in this series may sometimes meet the criteria for a folistic epipedon, but this horizon is not diagnostic within the Haplocryepts great group.
Soils in this series do not have identifiable secondary carbonates within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface, though some horizons may effervesce.
