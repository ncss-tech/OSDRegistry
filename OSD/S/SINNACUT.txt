SINNACUT SERIES

The Sinnacut series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Sinnacut soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal, glassy over mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sinnacut very gravelly ashy loamy sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 40 percent gravel, 1 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones, and 1 percent boulders.

    2Cr--89 to 114 cm; weathered granodiorite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mono County, California; in the Bodie Hills about 2.1 kilometers northeast of Conway Summit; approximately 335 meters north and 640 meters west of the southeast corner of section 24, T. 3 N., R. 25 E.; USGS Lundy 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 6 minutes 4.0 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 10 minutes 1.0 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.1011111 latitude, -119.1669444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section during fall, winter, and spring; usually dry from July through early October; xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 76 cm; includes the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons.
Depth to major lithologic discontinuity: 37 to 62 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.  

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 12 to 18 percent;
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel.  Lithology of rock fragments is granitic rocks such as granodiorite and granite.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Bodiehill series.  Bodiehill soils are very deep and average 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sinnacut soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on backslope positions. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,075 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rancheria and Rattlegulch soils.  Rancheria soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm and have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick.  Rattlegulch soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm and have mollic epipedons less than 25 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Sinnacut soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, western needlegrass, and currant.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, in the western part of the Great Basin.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
