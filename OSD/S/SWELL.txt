SWELL SERIES

The Swell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous sandstone and shale.  Swell soils are on backslopes and toeslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Series in a closely similar family are the Brimhall (NM), Peagre (T)(CO) and Robroost (UT) series.  These soils have a superactive CE activity class. In addition, Robroost soils have mean annual soil temperature higher than 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from gypsiferous and calcareous sandstone and shale, principally from the Jurassic age Carmel and/or Summerville formations
Landform:  backslopes and toeslopes of hills, alluvial fans
Slopes:  2 to 12 percent
Elevation:  1,311 to 1,890 meters
Mean annual temperature:  8.9 to 11.7 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 23 cm
Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.
Frost-free period:  130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Goblin and Mussentuchit series.  The Goblin soils are shallow to a paralithic contact, have gypsic mineralogy, do not have a calcic or gypsic horizon and are on hill summits.  The Mussentuchit soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, do not have a calcic horizon and are on hills upslope from the Swell soils.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes Indian ricegrass, fourwing saltbush, rabbitbrush, winterfat, galleta and sand dropseed.  This soil is correlated to Desert Gypsum R034XY105UT ecological site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah Desertic Basins; LRR D, MLRA 34B; moderate extent; about 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) in Emery County, Utah.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery soil survey area, Utah, 2011, Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand and Sevier Counties soil survey area.  Named after a prominent local geographic feature, the San Rafael Swell. This series was proposed as a cooler competitor to the Robroost series.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  (Bw, Bk1, Bk2, Bky horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 13 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 41 cm.  (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 41 to 112 cm.  (Bk1, Bk2, Bky horizons)
Gypsic horizon:  The zone from 81 to 191 cm.  (Bky, By horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample number 84UT015008, about 7 km (4.5 miles) north of the type location.
