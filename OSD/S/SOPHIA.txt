SOPHIA SERIES

The Sophia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous silty eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping shoulder slope positions above petrocalcic escarpments in the Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A).  The slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).
