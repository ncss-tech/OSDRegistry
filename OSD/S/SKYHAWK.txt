SKYHAWK SERIES

The Skyhawk series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to siltstone and shale. Skyhawk soils formed in alluvium derived from basalt and residuum derived from siltstone on risers of dissected fan terraces. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 35 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Ustic Calciargids

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Villedry (CO) series. Villedry soils average 15 to 30 inches to the base of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Skyhawk soils are on risers of dissected fan terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary basalt and residuum derived from Cretaceous siltstone. Slopes range from 35 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches about half of which falls as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The remainder falls as gentle rain or snow between December and mid-April. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eagleye, Lavellga, and Toadlena soils. Eagleye soils are shallow to shale, lack diagnostic horizons, and occur on backslopes of structural benches. Lavellga soils are very deep, have carbonatic mineralogy, and occur on adjacent treads of fan terraces. Toadlena soils are shallow, contain gypsic horizons, and occur on summits and footslopes of structural benches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Skyhawk soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is blue grama, galleta, New Mexico feathergrass, black grama, fourwing saltbush, datil yucca, and scattered Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Skyhawk soils are of small extent on the Four Corners Platform portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.
