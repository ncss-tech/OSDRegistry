SCHOOLHOUSE SERIES



The Schoolhouse series consists of shallow over bedrock, excessively

drained soils on mountain sideslopes and ridges.  They formed in

material weathered from intermediate intrusive rocks.  Permeability is

very rapid.  Slopes are 10 to 90 percent.  The average annual

precipitation is about 19 inches and the average annual air temperature

is about 46 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Lithic Xerorthents



TYPICAL PEDON:  Schoolhouse gravelly loamy sand - on a 70 percent

northwest slope under rangeland vegetation at 4,500 feet elevation.



    A1--0 to 1 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loamy sand,

dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure;

soft, very friable, common very fine and fine roots; common very fine

interstitial pores; 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt

wavy boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)



    A2--1 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loamy sand, dark brown

(10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very

friable, common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial

pores; 25 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt irregular

boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)



    C1--5 to 17 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) extremely gravelly

loamy sand, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) moist; single grain; loose; 90

percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt irregular boundary.  (5

to 14 inches thick)



    R--17 inches; granodiorite.



TYPE LOCATION:  Elmore County, Idaho; about 3 miles south of

Featherville; about 600 feet north and 1,000 feet west of the center of

the northeast 1/4, section 28, T.3N., R.10E.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Waterman series.  Waterman soils have an average

annual temperature of about 56 degrees F and an average January

temperature of about 42 degrees F.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Schoolhouse soils are on mountain sideslopes and

ridges at elevations of 3,300 to 6,400 feet.  Slopes are 10 to 90

percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from intermediate

intrusive and metamorphic rocks.  The average annual precipitation is

15 to 22 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 48

degrees F, with an average January temperature of about 20 degrees F.

The average January soil temperature is 34 to 37 degrees F.  The (32

degrees F) frost-free period is 85 to 120 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Bauscher, Oland, Rainey,

Roanhide, and Van Dusen soils.  Bauscher, Oland, and Van Dusen soils

are deep, have a mollic epipedon, and are on north-facing slopes or

toeslopes.  Rainey and Roanhide soils are moderately deep over bedrock,

have a mollic epipedon, and are on landscape positions similar to

Schoolhouse soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained, medium or rapid

runoff; very rapid permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Schoolhouse soils are used for rangeland,

wildlife, and watershed.  The potential vegetation in the natural plant

community is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, mountain big

sagebrush, and antelope bitterbrush.  At higher elevations, there may

be scattered Ponderosa pine, chokecherry, and serviceberry.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern part of the Idaho Batholith.

Moderately extensive.
