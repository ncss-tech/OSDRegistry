STILLWATER SERIES

The Stillwater series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Stillwater soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Churchill County, Nevada; in the Lahontan Valley about 2 miles northeast of the town of Stillwater; approximately 2,400 feet south and 1,067 feet east of the northwest corner of section 4, T. 19 N., R. 31 E.; USGS Stillwater 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 32 minutes 31.4 seconds N. and longitude 118 degrees 30 minutes 56 seconds W.; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5420556 latitude, -118.515556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually saturated with water for at least one month in some part of the moisture control section unless artificially drained; dry in all parts in summer and fall unless irrigated; Seasonal periods of aquic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 61 cm; includes transitional AC horizons.
Depth to horizons with aquic conditions: 46 to 152 cm during seasonal spring and early summer periods of saturation with ground water and anaerobic conditions.
Linear extensibility (LE): 6 to 11 cm between the soil surface and a depth of 100 cm.
Effervescence: Noneffervescent to violently effervescent; the zone from 25 to 50 cm is either noneffervescent or is only effervescent in spots but not in all parts.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blend, Darwin, Ricco, Saddlerock, Sansdessein , and Waldo series.

Blend, Darwin, and Sansdessein soils have long periods of aquic moisture regime.  Ricco soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C., have cambic horizons, and do not contain significant amounts of sodium.  Saddlerock soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C. and do not have subhorizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Waldo soils are strongly acid through slightly acid, have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 13, and do not have subhorizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stillwater soils are on flood plains.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1158 to 1219 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bunejug, Carson, and Swope soils.  Bunejug soils are coarse-loamy.  Carson soils are very-fine.  Swope soils are fine-loamy over clayey.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; and moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Many areas of these soils have altered drainage and are now somewhat poorly drained.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 1.5 and 5 feet (shallow to deep free water occurrence classes) from April through July.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Stillwater soils are used for irrigated alfalfa, small grains, grass-legume pastures, and native rangeland.  The vegetation in rangeland is black greasewood, inland saltgrass, and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 27.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 61 cm (Ap, A, An, and ACn horizons).
Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 46 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the ACn, Cn, and Ckn1, and Ckn2 horizons).
Fluventic feature - Stratification and irregular organic carbon distribution.
Vertic feature - Linear extensibility of more than 6 centimeters from the soil surface to 100 cm (Ap, A, An, ACn, Cn, and Ckn1 horizons and part of the Ckn2 horizon).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 79 to 152 cm (Ckn1 and Ckn2 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (ACn, Cn, and Ckn1 horizons and parts of the An and Ckn2 horizons).

The revision of June 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Fluvaquentic Vertic Endoaquolls.
