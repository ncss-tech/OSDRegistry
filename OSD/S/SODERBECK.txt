SODERBECK SERIES

The Soderbeck series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils which are deep to a paralithic contact over a lithic contact with sandstone. They formed in loamy-skeletal alluvium over sandy-skeletal alluvium on flood plains. Permeability is moderate in the loamy-skeletal alluvium, rapid or very rapid in the sandy-skeletal alluvium, and moderately rapid or rapid in the paralithic sandstone. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Aquic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Soderbeck very gravelly loam, on a nearly level slope, in a cleared area, at an elevation of about 800 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A--0 to 4 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine and fine roots and common medium roots; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick) 

 Bt1--4 to 18 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3); moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; very few faint dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay bridges between sand grains; 50 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 Bt2--18 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; 50 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; common coarse prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation and common medium distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2)iron depletions; very few faint dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay bridges between sand grains; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.) 

 2BC--28 to 42 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; few very fine and fine roots; 50 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (5 to 23 inches thick) 

 3Cr--42 to 55 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandstone residuum; weakly cemented; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick) 

 3R--55 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) hard sandstone bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Burnett County, Wisconsin; about 4 miles west of Grantsburg, along the St Croix River; located about 1,025 feet north and 25 feet west of the southeast corner of section 13, T. 38 N., R. 20 W.; USGS Bass Creek topographic quadrangle; lat. 45 degrees 46 minutes 34 seconds N. and long. 92 degrees 46 minutes 31 seconds W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to a lithic contact with sandstone ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Clay content as a weighted average in the loamy-skeletal alluvium ranges from 12 to 18 percent and 1 to 3 percent in the sandy-skeletal alluvium. Cementation of the Cr horizon ranges from extremely weakly cemented in the upper part to moderately cemented in the lower part. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout. 

Some pedons have an Oa horizon. 

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is very gravelly loam. Volume of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 60 percent as a weighted average. Volume of gravel ranges from 25 to 45 percent, volume of cobbles ranges from 10 to 35 percent, and the volume of stones ranges from 1 to 5 percent throughout. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is the very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogs of loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam. Volume of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 80 percent as a weighted average. Volume of gravel ranges from 25 to 55 percent, volume of cobbles ranges from 10 to 35 percent, and the volume of stones ranges from 1 to 5 percent throughout. 

The 2BC horizon has hue 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is the extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly analogs of coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or sand. Volume of rock fragments ranges from 60 to 80 percent as a weighted average. Volume of gravel ranges from 35 to 60 percent, volume of cobbles ranges from 20 to 35 percent, and the volume of stones ranges from 1 to 5 percent throughout. 

The 3Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, chroma of 1 or 2. It is extremely weakly cemented to moderately cemented partially weathered sandstone 

The 3R horizon is strongly cemented to indurated, unweathered sandstone bedrock. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy-skeletal alluvium over sandy-skeletal alluvium over sandstone
Landform--flood plains
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--780 to 820 feet
Mean annual air temperature--39 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation--28 to 33 inches
Frost-free period--100 to 130 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bigisland, Dairyland, Clemens, and Makwa soils. The somewhat excessively drained Bigisland soils are on higher, more steeply sloping landscape positions. The moderately well drained Dairyland soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Makwa soils occupy lower landscape positions than Soderbeck soils. The somewhat poorly drained Clemens soils are very deep to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is low. Permeability is moderate in the loamy-skeletal alluvium, rapid or very rapid in the sandy-skeletal alluvium, and moderately rapid or rapid in the paralithic sandstone. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet from April to June in most years. These soils are rarely flooded for brief periods in April. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are in woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Common trees are quaking aspen, white spruce, white pine, balsam fir and red maple. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Wisconsin. LRR K, MLRA 91B. This soil is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-4 (Duluth, Minnesota).
