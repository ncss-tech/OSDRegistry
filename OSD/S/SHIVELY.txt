SHIVELY SERIES

The Shively series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone, rhyolite and welded tuffs.  Shively soils are on concave mountain and hill side slopes with northerly aspects.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Shively loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    A2--20 to 41 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    A3--41 to 61 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    AC--61 to 79 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

    C--79 to 117 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

    2Cr--117 to 142 cm; light gray (10YR 7/1) weathered tuffaceous sandstone crushes to very fine sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:   Elko County, Nevada, approximately 6 miles southeast of Wildhorse Reservoir, about 1,000 feet east and 2,100 feet south of the northwest corner, sec. 13, T. 42 N., R. 55 E.; USGS Wagon Springs 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 32 minutes 11 seconds N, longitude 115 degrees 43 minutes 53 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.5363889 latitude, -115.731389 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist winter and spring, dry late July through early October; typic xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 90 cm.
Profile reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.
Depth to paralithic contact: 100 to 150 cm.  Some pedons in colluvial positions are 150 to 200 cm deep to a paralithic contact.

Particle-size control section - Textures, upper part:  Loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Textures, lower part:  Fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.
Clay content:  Average 10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 30 percent, mainly gravel in any one horizon, but averages 0 to 15 percent.

A horizon
Value:  2 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist with value of 2 dry common only in the surface subhorizon of some pedons.
Chroma:  1 through 3.

C horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 4.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or is massive.

Cr horizon 
Reflects colors of parent material.

COMPETING SERIES:   These are the Cinderspring, Iver, Kabear, Lobert, Ola, Prucree, Redmount, Suryon, Taterpa and Wagore series.  

Cinderspring and Iver soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Kabear, Lobart, Redmount, Suryon, Taterpa and Wagore soils have cambic horizons.  Ola soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a granitic paralithic contact.  Prucree soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shively soils are on concave mountain and hill side slopes with northerly aspects.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuffaceous sandstone, rhyolite and welded tuffs.   Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,500 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is about 6 to 7 degrees C; the average annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, and the frost-free season is 60 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Cotant and McIvey series.  Cotant soils are shallow to a paralithic contact and has an argillic horizon.  McIvey soils are very deep and have a clayey-skeletal argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:   Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:   Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally serviceberry, snowberry, mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Nevada bluegrass, Thurber needlegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  MLRA 25, 24.  These soils are not extensive.
