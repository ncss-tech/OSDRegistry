DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches - A, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (60 inches - Ap, A, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, BC, and C horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 centimeters (15 inches - Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 102 centimeters (15 to 40 inches - Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is supported by lab sample number S95IA-193-005, NSSL.
Taxonomy version--second edition, 1999.

The 2 chroma colors below the mollic epipedon and the redoximorphic concentrations in the cambic horizon are not pedogenic and are thought to be derived from the parent material.
