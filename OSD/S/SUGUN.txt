SUGUN SERIES

The Sugun series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, shale, and quartzite.  Sugun soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sugun sandy loam, on a west facing, 1 percent slope in pasture at an elevation of 5,050 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--6 to 17 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)

    C2--17 to 33 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick)

    C3--33 to 49 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)

    C4--49 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about .25 miles south of Gusher; located about 1,950 feet east and 625 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 19, T. 2 S., R. 2 E., USBM; Forth Duchesne, Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 18 minutes 0 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 48 minutes 49 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Typic aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 50 degrees F.
Depth to endosaturation:  1.5 to 5.0 feet to irrigation induced saturation during the months of April through December
EC (mmohs/cm): 0 to 16

Particle-size control section:  10 to 18 percent clay

A horizon:
Hue:  5YR to 10YR
Chroma:  2 to 6
Texture:  sandy loam or clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 15 percent
SAR: 0 TO 13
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR 
Value:  4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 to 6
Texture:  stratified with sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, and loam with thin strata of silt loam or clay loam all averaging sandy loam
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 15 percent
Gypsum: 0 to 3
SAR: 0 to 10

COMPETING SERIES:  A current competitor is the Walkup series.  A competitor prior to the Seventh Edition, 1996 Keys to Soil Taxonomy is the Preble series.

Walkup:  have hue yellower than 7.5YR
Preble:  contain durinodes

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Parent material:  alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, shale, and quartzite
Landform:  alluvial flats.
Slopes:  0 to 4 percent
Elevation: 5,000 to 5,200 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 8 inches.
Frost-free period:  110 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Othog, Shotnick, Stygee, and the Turzo series.  

Othog, Shotnick, Stygee, and Turzo soils are well drained and do not have an irrigation induced water table.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly and moderately well drained, low runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are irrigated pastureland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (C1, C2, and C3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches.  (A horizon)
Oxyaquic feature:  Saturated within 150 cm of the surface for one month or more in most years due to an irrigation induced water table.
Endosaturation: The presence of an irrigation induced water table from 1.5 to 5.0 feet during the months of April to December.

The CEC activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.
