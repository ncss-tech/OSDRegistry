SOAPCREEK SERIES

The Soapcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluvaquentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Soapcreek silty clay, in irrigated hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 13 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong very fine granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many fine tubular and interstitial pores; common worm casts; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

    A--13 to 30 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common worm casts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Bk1--30 to 51 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; few fine calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 38 cm thick)

    Bk2--51 to 76 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; common medium prominent light brown (7.5YR 6/4) redox concentrations, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 38 cm thick)

    Bg1--76 to 102 cm; gray (5Y 6/1) silty clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; common medium prominent light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) redox depletions, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) and dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 38 cm thick)

    Bg2--102 to 152 cm; gray (5Y 6/1) silty clay, gray (5Y 5/1) moist; many distinct light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) redox depletions, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; 5 percent gravel and charcoal fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
