SALTINE SERIES

The Saltine series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium high in exchangeable sodium.  The soils are on flood plains in river valleys in Loess Uplands in MLRA 102C Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is 710 millimeters (28 inches) at the type location.

The common grasses are inland saltgrass, western wheatgrass and blue grama, with sparse amounts of switchgrass.  
Alkali sacaton is in the western part of its occurrence.  
A few acres are irrigated.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dodge County, Nebraska, 1975.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches)
Cambic horizon: 18 to 76 centimeters (7 to 30 inches)
Sodium adsorption ratio: greater than 13 in upper 51 centimeters (20 inches) and decreases below 51 centimeters (20 inches) 
Aquic conditions: saturation at depths below 76 centimeters (30 inches) 
Redox features: at depths below 76 centimeters (30 inches)

Areas of similar soils were commonly correlated as Slickspots in former surveys, or as a saline-alkali phase of an established series. 

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

JGA 12/11 Modified opening paragraph to include MLRA 102, changes precipitation to millimeters.  Changes some terms in profile and range of characteristics to appropriate terminology and well as adding metric measurements.  Updated mean annual soil temp to fit with mean annual air temp. Updated electrical conductivity ranges to fit NSSH ranges.  Deleted statements pertaining to closely related families in Competing Series section.  Added frequently flooded. Added LLRs and MLRAs to Distribution and Extent.
