SALTMOUNT SERIES

The Saltmount series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits.  Saltmount soils are on parna dunes and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Saltmount soils are on parna dunes and dissected lake plains.  These soils formed in eolian deposits over lacustrine deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 4,450 to 4,580 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bighat, Crutcher, and Raglan soils.  Bighat soils have natric horizons.  Crutcher soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are saturated at a depth of 40 to 60 inches at some time during the year.  Raglan soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to high surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Saltmount soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly a very sparse stand of black greasewood and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California and northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.
