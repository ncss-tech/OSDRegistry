SAGOLLOW SERIES

The Sagollow series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in silty and clayey alluvium from mixed sources. These soils are on stream terraces, drainageways and dissected fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: stream terraces, drainageways and dissected fan remnants
Elevation:  5,900 to 7,000 feet
Slope:  0 to 10 percent
Parent material: silty and clayey alluvium from mixed sources
Climate:  long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers
Average annual precipitation: 16 to 24 inches
Average annual temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nythar, Streek and Swanpeak soils. Nythar soils are fine-loamy, and very poorly drained.  They are mainly in the bottom of drainageways. Streek and Swanpeak soils are clayey and are mainly on adjacent uplands.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; very low to low surface runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Sagollow soils are used mainly for rangeland and pasture. Native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, mules ear, snowberry, willow, onion grass, yarrow, baltic rush, and mixed grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sagollow soils are of small extent in southeastern Idaho. MLRA 9.
