SCARPAL SERIES

The Scarpal series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium from basalt, rhyolite, pyroclastic tuffs and Mesozoic marine sediments on upland escarpments and steep, north and east-facing mountain sideslopes.  Slope gradients are 20 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches; mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal, glassy over isotic, frigid Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Scarpal extremely stony ashy sandy loam - upland forest, on a 40 percent convex slope at an elevation of 5800 feet. (Colors are for air dry unless otherwise noted.)

        A1--2 to 8 inches, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely stony ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium platy structure; very soft, very friable, slightly sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.

	A2--8 to 16 inches, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely stony ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium, and common coarse roots; common very fine to medium irregular pores; 10 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.
