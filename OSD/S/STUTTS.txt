STUTTS SERIES

The Stutts series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on outwash plains, moraines, lake plains, and deltas.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy part and high or very high in the sandy part. They formed in loamy eolian or glaciolacustrine deposits over sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, frigid Typic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Stutts sandy loam, on a 2 percent slope, in a forested area, at an elevation of 245 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Oa--0 to 2 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) broken face, highly decomposed plant material; many very fine to coarse roots; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A--2 to 5 centimeters; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) broken face, sandy loam; moderate fine granular structure; friable; many very fine to coarse roots; few very fine vesicular pores; very strongly acid; abrupt broken boundary. (0 to 5 centimeters thick)

  E--5 to 18 centimeters; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) broken face, sandy loam, light gray (5YR 7/1) broken face, dry; moderate very fine subangular blocky and moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine to coarse roots; few very fine vesicular pores; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 15 centimeters thick)

  Bhs--18 to 23 centimeters; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) broken face, sandy loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine to coarse roots; few very fine vesicular pores; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (2 to 10 centimeters thick)

  Bs1--23 to 33 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) broken face, fine sandy loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many very fine to medium and few coarse roots; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) strongly cemented ortstein occupies 38 percent of the horizon, ortstein extends to a depth of 56 centimeters horizon as discontinuous tongues 18 to 51 centimeters apart and 10 to 25 centimeters wide; few very fine vesicular pores; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (8 to 20 centimeters thick)

  Bs2--33 to 48 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) broken face, loamy fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky and weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; about 1 percent gravel; many very fine to medium and few coarse roots; few very fine vesicular pores; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 centimeters thick)

  2BC--48 to 84 centimeters; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) broken face, sand; single grain; loose; few very fine to fine roots; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 41 centimeters thick)

  2C--84 to 203 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) broken face, sand; single grain; loose; about 4 percent gravel; moderately acid. (76 to 127 centimeters thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Alger County, Michigan; about 16 miles southeast of Trenary; 1400 feet east and 500 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 35, T. 44 N., R.19 W., Munising Township; USGS Tie Lake topographic quadrangle; lat. 46 degrees 9 minutes 37 seconds N. and long. 86 degrees 39 minutes 02 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the loamy cap ranges from 13 to 61 centimeters.  The weighted average of the particle-size control section has silt plus clay content of less than 15 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy layers and from 0 to 10 percent in the sandy layers.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid. Some pedons have an AE horizon with colors and textures similar to the A and E horizons.

The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.

The Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Ortstein occupies 0 to 30 percent of the exposed surface area of the horizon.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.

The Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Ortstein occupies 0 to 40 percent of the exposed surface area of the horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.

The Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand. Ortstein occupies 0 to 30 percent of the exposed surface area of the horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.

The 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Ortstein occupies 0 to 15 percent of the exposed surface area of the horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.

The 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adams, Cusino, Duxbury, Kalkaska, Liminga, and Pence series. The Adams, Kalkaska, Liminga and Cusino soils have a combined content of silt plus clay less than 15 percent throughout the series control section. Duxbury soils contain 15 to 70 percent rock fragments in the 2C horizon. The Pence soils average 15 to 45 percent rock fragments in the lower Bs2, 2BC, and 2C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Stutts soils are on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 200 to 256 meters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 860 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Stutts soils are associated with Au Gres, Deford, Kalkaska, Liminga, McMillan, and Wainola soils. Au Gres soils are somewhat poorly drained and occupy low lying positions on the landscape. Deford soils are poorly drained and occupy depressions and drainageways. Kalkaska and Liminga soils are sandy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. McMillan soils have lamellae and are on similar landscape positions.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Runoff is low or medium, depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy layers and high and very high in the sandy layers. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in woodland. Major tree species include sugar maple, yellow birch, aspen, and American beech. Common ground plants include spinulose shield fern, star flower, trout lily and rosey twisted stalk.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Upper Peninsula of Michigan. MLRAs 93B and 94B. The series is of minor extent.
