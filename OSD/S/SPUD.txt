SPUD SERIES

The Spud series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in fine textured alluvium, colluvium, or residuum weathered from basalt with modification from underlying sandstone and shale.  These soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Spud very stony loam, on a west facing slightly convex lower mountainside with a slope of 25 percent in a mixed conifer woodland at 2500 meters elevation.  When described, the soil was nearly dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)
