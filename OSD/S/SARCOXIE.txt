SARCOXIE SERIES

The Sarcoxie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in loess over reworked loess and/or till. Sarcoxie soils are on summits and shoulders of uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 7 percent slopes. Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Sarcoxie silty clay loam on a north-facing 3 percent slope in grassland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap --0 to 15 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1), silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A--15 to 33 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1), silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined A horizons are 18 to 45 centimeters thick)

  Bt1--33 to 62 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4), masses of oxidized iron in matrix; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. 

  Bt2--62 to 89 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2), silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), masses of oxidized iron in matrix; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary (Combined Bt horizons are 20 to 45 centimeters thick) 

  2Bt3--89 to 125 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2), clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many distinct clay films on vertical faces of peds; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), masses of oxidized iron in matrix; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (2Bt horizon is 15 to 95 centimeters thick)

  2BC--125 to 160 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2), clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm, hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many coarse distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4), masses of oxidized iron in matrix; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (2BC horizon is 15 to 45 centimeters thick)

  2C--160 to 203 centimeters; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), clay loam; massive; firm, hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6), masses of oxidized iron in matrix; neutral.
