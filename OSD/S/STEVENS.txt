STEVENS SERIES

The Stevens series consists of moderately deep (to a densic horizon), well drained soils that formed in glacial till of mixed mineralogy (including argillite, quartzite, and limestone), influenced by loess and volcanic ash. Stevens soils are on hills and hillslopes. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Stevens County, Washington; about 3.2 kilometers northeast of Barstow; 120 meters east and 150 meters north of the southwest corner of sec. 11, T. 38 N., R. 37 E. Latitude - 48 degrees, 48 minutes, 0 seconds north; Longitude - 118 degrees, 5 minutes, 0.46 seconds west; NAD83; USGS Bossburg Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm -- 8.9 to 11.1 degrees C).  
Soil Moisture -- usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 10 and 60 cm for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  
Mollic epipedon -- 50 to 100 cm thick 
Depth to densic material -- 64 to 100 cm

Note: Base saturation (by sum of cations) - less than 75 percent in parts of the upper 75 cm of the soil

Vitrandic Feature 
Thickness -- 18 to 35 cm 
Moist bulk density - 1.15 to 1.35 g/cc
Volcanic glass content - 5 to 20 percent
Acid-oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 of the acid-oxalate extractable Fe -- 0.4 to 1.0 percent
15-bar water retention -- 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples  
Depth to calcium carbonate -- 64 to greater than 150 cm

Particle-size control section -- 5 to 30 percent coarse fragments.  

Ap, A1, A2 horizons
Value: 3 to 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3 dry or moist
Texture (less than 2mm fraction): ashy silt loam (surface), silt loam
Clay content: 6 to 18 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 30 percent--0 to 30 percent gravel; 0 to 8 percent cobbles
Reaction: pH 6.6 to 7.3

Bt, BCt, (Bw, BA where present) horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y dry or moist
Value; 4 to 6 dry; 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist

Note: The Bt and BCt horizons have thin patchy clay films on peds and in pores. However, the increase in clay is not sufficient to constitute an argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Stevens soils are have elevations of 455 to 1,200 meters. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in glacial till of mixed mineralogy (including argillite, quartzite, and limestone), influenced by loess and volcanic ash. They occur on hills and hillslopes. They are in a continental climate. Mean annual temperature is 7.7 to 10.0 degrees C. Average annual precipitation is about 325 to 650 mm, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedonia, Dehart, Garrison, Hunters, Molcal, and Scoap soils and the competing Donavan soil. Cedonia and Hunters soils have a fine-silty control section. Dehart, Garrison, and Scoap soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Molcal soils are calcareous and have a coarse-loamy control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and moderately low or low in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production and grazing, alfalfa hay, grass-legume hay, and small grains are common crops.  The native vegetation is ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with an understory of common snowberry, pinegrass, blue wildrye, creeping Oregon-grape, Saskatoon serviceberry, spreading sweetroot, and white stoneseed. These areas are growing bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, rose and common snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington; Ferry and Stevens County.  The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 43A.
