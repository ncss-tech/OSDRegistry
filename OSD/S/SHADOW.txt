SHADOW SERIES

The Shadow series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from gneiss, schist, andesite and granite.  These soils are on moraines, mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Shadow extremely channery sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oe--0 to 1 inch; moderately decomposed forest litter. (1 to 3 inches thick)

 A--1 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely channery sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine, medium and coarse roots; many fine pores; 45 percent channers and 15 percent flagstones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

 E--4 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very channery sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine pores; 50 percent channers; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 24 inches thick)

 Bw--18 to 31 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely channery sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; 65 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

 BC--31 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely channery sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 70 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Shadow soils are used mainly as woodland, recreation, wildlife habitat, and for watersheds.  The potential native vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir with an understory of pinegrass, common snowberry, elk sedge, ninebark, and heartleaf arnica.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Shadow soils are moderately extensive in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Madison County Area, Montana, 1983; proposed in Madison County Area, 1981.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 18 inches (Oe, A, E horizons)
Cambic horizon - from 18 to 31 inches (Bw horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 11 to 41 inches (part of E, Bw, part of BC horizons)

Shadow soils have a cryic temperature regime, an ustic moisture regime and an udic moisture subclass.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil interpretation records - MT0392, MT0708.

Classification Notes: The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups.
