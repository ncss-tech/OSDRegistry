SPRINGLAKE SERIES 

The Springlake series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy and gravelly deposits on outwash plains, ground moraines, kame moraines, stream terraces and beach ridges. Permeability is very rapid. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Haplorthods 

TYPICAL PEDON: Springlake loamy sand, on a north-facing slope of 4 percent, in a forest area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated). 

 Oi--0 to 2 centimeters; slightly decomposed leaf litter; moderately acid. 

 A--2 to 18 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine to coarse roots; some mixing with E and B horizons; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary. (2 to 16 centimeters thick) 

 E--18 to 23 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2); loamy coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine to coarse roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 15 centimeters thick) 

 Bhs--23 to 36 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) loamy coarse sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 28 centimeters thick) 

 Bs--36 to 58 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; common fine roots; about 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (22 to 51 centimeters thick) 

 2BC--58 to 66 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 15 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 25 centimeters thick) 

 2C--66 to 203 centimeters; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Mackinac County, Michigan; located about 3,000 feet north and 200 feet west of the southeast corner of section 30, T. 44 N., R. 7 W.; USGS Rexton topographic quadrangle; lat. 46 degrees 10 minutes 53.1 seconds N. and long. 85 degrees 13 minutes 03 seconds W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 38 to 102 centimeters and corresponds to the depth of free carbonates. Calcium carbonate content ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the upper part of the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and the substratum. 

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid. 

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or slightly acid. 

The Bhs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, sand or loamy coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid. 

The Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or the gravelly analogs of these textures. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline. 

The 2BC horizon has colors and textures similar to those of the 2C horizon. Some pedons have a thin beta B horizon (less than 1/10 the thickness of the overlying horizons) at the contact of the carbonates. 

The 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand or the gravelly analogs of these textures. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deerton, Furlong, Kalkaska, Liminga, Omega, and Pence series and the closely related Adams and Duxbury series. All of these soils, except for Furlong, have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate within the series control section. In addition, the Deerton and Furlong soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 centimeters. Kalkaska, Liminga, and Omega soils have less that 10 percent gravel in the series control section. Pence soils have more than 15 percent combined content of silt and clay in the upper 51 centimeters of the profile. The Adams and Duxbury soils have isotic mineralogy. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Springlake soils are on nearly level to rolling slopes of outwash plains, ground moraines, kame moraines, stream terraces, lake basins, beach ridges and eskers. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 840 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Greylock, Guardlake, Kalkaska, Longrie, and Rubicon soils. They are all on similar landscape positions. The Greylock soils are finer textured throughout the profile. Guardlake soils are sandy-skeletal. Kalkaska soils do not have gravelly substratums. Longrie soils are underlain by limestone bedrock. Rubicon soils do not have the darker colored upper subsoil and gravelly substratum. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Surface runoff is negligible to low depending on the slope. Permeability is very rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soils are forested. Overstory vegetation consists of sugar maple, quaking aspen, red pine and paper birch. Some of the common forest understory vegetation includes sugar maple, hazelnut, ladyfern, spinulose woodfern, American fly honeysuckle, Solomons-seal, rosy twistedstalk, and Canada mayflower.
