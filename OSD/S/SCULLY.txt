SCULLY SERIES

The Scully series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 cm (8 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no series recognized in this family. The Langspring series in a closely related family is fine-loamy and superactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The type location is in the Cretaceous Hilliard shale Formation.
Landform:  footslopes and toeslopes of hills

Mean annual temperature:  3.3 to 6.1 degrees C (38 to 43 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  178 to 254 mm (7 to 10 inches)
Precipitation pattern:  Peak precipitation is in May; lowest is in summer.
Frost-free period:  60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fiveoh, Pepal, Quealman, and Sandbranch series.  Fiveoh soils have less than 18 percent clay and are on alluvial terraces, fan aprons, and broad toeslopes.  Pepal soils have less than 18 percent clay.  Sandbranch and Quealman soils are on floodplains and low alluvial terraces.  Sandbranch soils have a natric horizon, and Quealman soils are coarse-loamy, have irregular decrease in organic carbon, and are stratified. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Indian ricegrass, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Wyoming.  MLRA 34A.  These soils are of moderate extent.
