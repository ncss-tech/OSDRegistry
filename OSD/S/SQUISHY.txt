SQUISHY SERIES

The Squishy series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from glacial outwash materials derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Squishy soils are on outwash terraces and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Histic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Squishy mucky peat--pastureland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oe--0 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) mucky peat, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid, (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 40 cm thick)

(40 to 75 cm thick)

 Cg1--71 to 119 cm; greenish gray (5GY 6/1) stratified sandy loam to gravelly loamy sand, dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist, masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 10 percent gravel; neutral, (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (30 to 75 cm thick)

 2Cg2--119 to 152 cm; greenish gray (5GY 6/1) very gravelly loamy sand, dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent olive brown (2.5Y 4/4), moist, masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 40 percent gravel; neutral, (pH 6.6);

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series recognized in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Squishy soils are on outwash terraces and plains.  They typically occur on shoulder and concave positions.  They formed in alluvium from glacial outwash materials derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.   Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Floatybog and Goodbye series.  

Floatybog soils have a histic epipedon greater than 40 cm thick.  Goodbye soils do not have a histic epipedon or an aquic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained; very high surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table at the surface (very shallow free water occurrence classes), throughout most years. Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  Frequent ponding at a depth of 3 to 10 cm is present for very long duration during most years. These soils are susceptible to flooding for brief periods from December to September.

USE AND VEGETATION: Squishy soils are used for pastureland, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly sedges and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
