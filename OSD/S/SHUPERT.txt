SHUPERT SERIES

The Shupert series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in sedimentary alluvium on stream terraces, valley floors and narrow canyon floors.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 36 cm and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dancehall (T), Neto, Podo, and Rabbitex soils.  Dancehall soils are loamy-skeletal and are intermixed with the Shupert soils.  Neto soils occur in drainageways at higher elevations, are coarse-loamy and have a typic ustic moisture regime.  Podo soils are shallow to bedrock and are on canyon walls under pinyon and Utah juniper.  Rabbitex soils have a mollic epipedon and a calcic horizon and are on mountain toeslopes and fans under Wyoming big sagebrush.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability, seasonal high water table may be present from April to August below a depth of 180 centimeters, rarely flooded for brief periods from March to October due to snowmelt and late summer thunderstorms.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Great Basin wildrye, basin big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, fourwing saltbush, muttongrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, and pepperweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern and central Utah mountains, Warm Central Desertic Basins, Mountains and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.  About 4,300 acres (1,700 hectares) in Carbon, Emery, and Sevier Counties, Utah.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Paunsaugunt Area, Utah, 1969.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 102 cm.  (parts of the C1, C2 and C3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 cm.  (A horizon)
Redoximorphic features:  masses of oxidized iron from 160 to 188 cm (C6 horizon)
Fluvent feature:  Irregular decrease of organic carbon from a depth of 25 to 125 cm; or at least 0.2 percent organic carbon of Holocene age at a depth of 125 cm below the soil surface

These soils were formerly classified as Typic Ustifluvents, loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid.  The type location was moved to Emery County and the soil moisture regime was changed from typic ustic in April 2008 since the original type location is no longer mapped Shupert.

Capillary rise may occur below a depth of 152 cm which may account for masses of oxidized iron in horizons below this depth.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
