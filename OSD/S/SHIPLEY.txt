SHIPLEY SERIES

The Shipley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Shipley soils are on beach terraces, inset fans, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Shipley silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong very thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine vesicular and interstitial, few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 13 cm thick)

    C--8 to 36 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial, common very fine and few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 64 cm thick)

    Cq--36 to 46 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial, common very fine and few fine tubular pores; 10 percent hard, 1 to 2 cm cylindrical durinodes; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 50 cm thick)

    C'--46 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8)

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 5 miles north of Eureka on Diamond Valley; about 1,200 feet north and 1,500 feet west of the southeast corner of section 15, T. 20 N., R. 53 E.; USGS Eureka 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 35 minutes 30 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 59 minutes 12 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5916667 latitude, -115.9866667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.
Other features:  Thin strata of sand and/or gravel are at depths below 100 cm in some pedons.  Gravelly substratum phases are recognized.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  Average 0 to 15 percent, but may have up to 35 percent in any one strata.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Strong or moderate very thin to medium platy or it is massive.
Consistence:  Soft to hard dry, very friable or friable moist.

C horizons
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam with
thin strata of loam or sandy loam in some pedons.
Structure:  Weak platy or subangular blocky or it is massive.  
Consistence:  Soft or slightly hard.
Durinodes:  Up to 20 percent 1 to 2 cm diameter, slightly hard or hard brittle durinodes can occur in any strata below 38 cm.  
Segregated carbonates:  Few fine or medium carbonate segregations may occur in any strata below 60 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hayeston series.  Hayeston soils have unconformable sandy-skeletal materials at depths of 64 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Shipley soils are on beach terraces, inset fans, and fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess, volcanic ash and pyroclastic materials.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alhambra and Kobeh soils.  Alhambra soils have horizons with more than 20 percent durinodes and a particle-size control section of dominantly moderately coarse textures over unconformable sandy-skeletal materials at depths of 76 to 100 cm.  Kobeh soils have a cambic horizon, horizons with more than 20 percent durinodes in a friable matrix, and unconformable sandy-skeletal materials at depths of 50 to 90 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and cropland.  Small grains and alfalfa are the principal crops.  Native vegetation is principally winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
