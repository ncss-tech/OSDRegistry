SANDALEE SERIES

The Sandalee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium on young terraces and stable floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Fluvaquentic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Sandalee sandy loam, on a floodplain landform with a slope of 0 percent at 381 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation.  When described on June 7, 2006 the soil was moist to 80 centimeters and saturated below. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; abrupt wavy boundary.

 Bg2--56 to 80 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; common distinct medium gray (2.5Y 6/1) iron depletions with clear boundaries in matrix and many distinct medium dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries in matrix; 5 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.

 Cg--80 to 150 cm; variegated loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common faint medium dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron with diffuse boundaries in matrix and many faint medium dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) iron depletions with diffuse boundaries in matrix; moderately acid (pH 5.9); 5 percent fine gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this or similar families.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Sandalee soils are on young terraces and floodplains at elevations of 300 to 450 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 600 to 1200 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kettling (T) and Torment (T) soils.  Kettling soils are found on the same landforms but do not have redoximorphic features.  Torment soils are found on the most active portions of the same floodplains, are somewhat excessively drained, and do not have pedogenic development.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, western redcedar, grand fir, and black cottonwood with an understory of pathfinder, wild ginger, trailing blackberry, sweet-scented bedstraw, and Pacific twisted stalk.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  North Cascades National Park Service Complex soil survey, 2011. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section:  2 to 102 centimeters (A, Bw1, Bg1, Bg2, and upper 22 centimeters of the Cg horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters (Oi, A, and the upper 7 centimeters of Bw horizon)
Cambic horizon: 11 to 80 centimeters (Bw, Bg1, and Bg2 horizons)
Redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less:  40 to 152 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2, and Cg horizons)
An irregular decrease in organic carbon is inferred from the alluvium parent material and the young terrace and floodplain landforms.
