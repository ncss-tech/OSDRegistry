XERIBRUSH SERIES

The Xeribrush series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on fan remnants, dipslopes, strike valleys, escarpments, scarp slopes and landslides. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Xeribrush loam, on a north facing, 21 percent slope in sagebrush at an elevation of 2,218 meters. The surface is covered by about 5 percent stones. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
