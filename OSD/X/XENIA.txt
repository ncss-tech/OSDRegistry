COMPETING SERIES: These are the Appleriver, Blair, Bunkum, Fishhook, Freeburg, Geff, Glenford, Keene, Muren, Reesville, Sugarvalley, and Torox series. Appleriver soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Blair, Bunkum, Freeburg, Geff, Keene, and Muren soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Fishhook soils have more than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Glenford soils are stratified within the series control section with loamy or sandy textures. Reesville soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to horizons containing more than 2 percent rock fragments. Sugarvalley soils have less than 12 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Torox soils have a moist bulk density of less than 1.75 g/cm3 in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Xenia soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1118 mm (35 to 44 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.7 degrees C (50 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 160 to 180 days. Elevation is 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fincastle, Miami, Ragsdale, Russell, and Treaty soils. The somewhat poorly drained Fincastle soils are on lower lying landform positions. The Miami soils and the well drained Russell soils are on higher lying landform positions or are on lower lying, more sloping positions. The Miami soils are also in areas of thinner loess. The poorly drained Ragsdale and Treaty soils are in depressions and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 76 cm (1.5 to 2.5 feet) during the winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff ranges from low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and low to moderately high in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till.

USE AND VEGETATION: Xenia soils are commonly cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay are the principal crops. Native vegetation is forest, with oak, hickory, and maple as dominant species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mainly in MLRAs 111A and 111D, and to lesser extent in MLRAs 108A, 114A, and 114B in central Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and eastern and central Illinois. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of large extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fayette and Union Counties, Indiana, 1958.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 127 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).
Densic contact: at 147 cm (top of the 2Cd1 horizon).
Aquic conditions: iron depletions in all horizons below a depth of 46 cm.

A bedrock substratum phase is currently recognized and may become a new series as subset soil surveys with this phase are updated.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.
