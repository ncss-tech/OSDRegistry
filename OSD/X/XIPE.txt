XIPE SERIES

The Xipe series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  The Xipe soils are on stream and river flood plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; approximately 8 miles south of Jackpot, Nevada, in the Salmon Falls Creek drainage, about 2,000 feet south and 1,500 feet west of the northeast corner of section 4, T. 45 N., R. 64 E.; USGS Middle Stack Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle;  longitude 41 degrees, 49 minutes, 05 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 43 minutes 42 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.8180333 latitude, -114.7283333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Saturated at some depth between the soil surface and 46 cm for at least one month during most years, mainly during late winter and spring.  Summer and fall months the depth to water table is 90 to 150 cm.  Drained phases are recognized.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 60 cm.
Depth to contrasting textures: 38 to 90 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Upper part is 18 to 35 percent and the lower part is up to 5 percent.
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam in the upper part; lower part is stratified loamy sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand.
Rock fragments:  Upper part is up to 5 percent and the lower part averages 15 to 35 percent with any one strata having up to 75 percent, mainly gravel.

A and AC horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  3 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist; color value of 6, dry is below 25 cm.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Xipe soils are on stream and river flood plains and terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ocala and Valmy soils.  Ocala soils lack a Mollic epipedon and are strongly salt and alkali effected.  Valmy soils lack a Mollic epipedon and have silica cementation at a depth of 20 to 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Very poorly drained, very slow runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly creeping wildrye, inland saltgrass and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  MLRA 25, 24.  These soils are not extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 51 cm (A1, A2, A3, Ab1 and Ab2 horizons).
Fluventic feature - Irregular decrease of organic carbon.
Lithologic discontinuity - The boundary at about 66 cm (2C horizon).
Zone of endosaturation - From 8 to 152 cm (The A2, A3, Ab1, Ab2 ACb, 2C and 3C horizons).
Seasonal water table - Within 0 to 46 cm.
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Ab1, Ab2, ACb, 2C1, and part of the 3C2 horizons).

Classification was changed in 1992 from Haplaquolls to Endoaquolls.
