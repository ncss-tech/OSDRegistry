XETO SERIES

The Xeto series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Xeto soils are on hills and paleoterrace risers.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Xeto extremely cobbly loam, on a northeast facing, simple, 40 percent slope in pinyon-juniper at an elevation of 1,890 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on March 22, 2005 the soil was moist from 0 to 79 cm. The surface is covered with about 10 percent cobbles.

    A--0 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 18 cm thick)

    Bk1--13 to 51 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; 13 percent calcium carbonate finely disseminated throughout and carbonate masses on the bottom of rock fragments; 20 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 61 cm thick)

    Bk2--51 to 79 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; 5 percent calcium carbonate finely disseminated throughout and carbonate masses on the bottom of rock fragments; 25 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 38 cm thick)

    Cr--79 to 104 cm; shale bedrock; neutral.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Archuleta County, CO, Archuleta soil survey area, 2005.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Calcic horizon - 25 to 79 cm (Bk horizons)
Paralithic contact - 79 cm to bedrock (Cr horizon)
