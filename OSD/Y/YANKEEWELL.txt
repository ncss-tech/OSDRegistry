YANKEEWELL SERIES

The Yankeewell series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt.  Yankeewell soils are on plateaus and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yankeewell soils are on plateaus and hills.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt.  These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,850 meters feet, but are typically 1,495 to 1,590 meters.  The highest elevations are on Diablo Peak.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Diablopeak, Lonegrave, and Noidee soils.  Diablopeak soils are clayey, shallow to lithic contacts, and have a typic aridic moisture regime.  Lonegrave soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic horizons, and a mesic temperature regime.  Noidee soils are clayey and shallow to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yankeewell soils are used for livestock grazing.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, shadscale, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
