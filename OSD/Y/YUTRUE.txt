YUTRUE SERIES



The Yutrue series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils on

basalt plains.  They formed in fine textured alluvium and residuum

derived dominantly from basalt.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes are

0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches

and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Haploxeralfs

soil unless otherwise noted.)

fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common moderately

thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores that are grayish brown

(10YR 5/2) dry and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; mildly

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the similiar Oxalis series.  Oxalis soils

have thermic soil temperature.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yutrue soils are on terraces and in shallow

drainageways and concave intermound areas on lava plains.  Elevations

are 3,600 to 5,200 feet.  The soils formed in residuum and alluvium

weathered from basalt.  Average annual precipitation is 11 to 16

inches.  Average January temperature is 22 degrees F; average July

temperature is 70 degrees F; average annual temperature is 45 degrees

to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bostrum, Gooding,

Karcal, and Power soils.  Bostrum and Karcal soils are 20 to 40 inches

deep to bedrock.  Bostrum, Gooding, and Power soils have textural Bt

horizons.  These soils occur on the same landscape.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; very

slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland.  Vegetation in the potential

natural plant community is Sandberg bluegrass, Idaho fescue, phlox,

alkali sagebrush, and forbs.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  The series is

moderately extensive.



MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Camas County, Idaho, 1977.



REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series

are:



Ochric epipedon - zone from the soil surface to approximately 2

inches.  Classification needs to be checked on this soil.  It appears

to fit vertisols.
