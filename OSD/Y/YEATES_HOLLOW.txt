YEATES HOLLOW SERIES

The Yeates Hollow series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum from conglomerate, sandstone and quartzite.  These soils are on fan remnants, hills, and mountain slopes and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yeates Hollow gravelly silt loam--native grasses and shrubs.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse granular structure parting to fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few coarse roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent angular gravel and 10 percent cobbles and 3 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt1--11 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to fine subangular blocky; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; thin continuous clay films; 30 percent angular gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 13 inches thick)

    Bt2--18 to 33 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; moderately thick continuous clay films; 35 percent angular gravel and 30 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

     Bt3--33 to 46 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; thin continuous clay films; 65 percent angular cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 19 inches thick)

    R--46 inches; fractured quartzite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cache County, Utah; 1.2 miles east of the mouth of North Cottonwood Canyon in Blacksmith Fork Canyon; 600 feet south and 800 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 16, T. 10 N., R. 3 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the 8 to 24 inch depth for more than 60 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 40 to 47 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 60 to 67 degrees F.
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 10 to 20 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted averages)
Clay content: 35 to 55 percent
Coarse fragment content: 35 to 85 percent; mixed cobbles, gravel and stones of sandstone and quartzite

Some pedons have a BC horizon with weak subangular blocky structure.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birchcreek, Bothwi (T), Derringer, Droem (T), Erakatak, Leevan, McIvey, Ravenswood, Roostercomb, Sharesnout (T), Threek (T) and Yago series.  Bothwi soils are slightly alkaline in the Bt horizon.  Birchcreek, Droem, Erakatak, Leevan, Ravenswood, Roostercomb, and Sharesnout soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Derringer soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  McIvey soils have argillic horizons that have discontinuities.  Threek soils have Bq silica horizons within 40 inches.  Yago soils have Bk horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yeates Hollow soils are on gently sloping to steep fan remnants, hills,  and very steep mountain slopes at elevations of 5,000 to 8,400 feet.  Slope gradients are 2 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium,  colluvium and residuum from conglomerate, sandstone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid, with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average precipitation is 14 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  Freeze-free period is 60 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Deer Creek, Donner Foxol, Harter, Horrocks, Lamondi, Manila, Smarts, St. Marys, Vicking, and Wallsburg soils.  Deer Creek soils have horizons of carbonate accumulation and less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizons.  Donner, Harter, and Manila soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Foxol and Wallsburg soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 inches or less.  Lamondi and St. Marys soils lack argillic horizons.  Horrocks, Smarts, and Vicking soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well and moderately well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used as rangeland, for spring-fall ranges for livestock and wildlife; some small areas are irrigated pastures.  The present vegetation is big sagebrush, oakbrush, bitterbrush, snowberry, serviceberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, slender wheatgrass, oniongrass, bluegrass and mulesear dock.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and northern Utah and southern Idaho.  The series is moderately extensive.
