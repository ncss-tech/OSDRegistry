COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yagercreek soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1150 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from interbedded and sandstone, mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1015 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mailridge, Mountbaldy, and Redwoodhouse soils. Mailridge and Redwoodhouse have a 20 percent increase in clay within 30 centimeters of the eluvial horizon and C horizons with less than 22 percent clay between 100 and 150 centimeters. Mountbaldy soils are less than 100 centimeters to a lithic contact. Redwoodhouse soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Mailridge and Mountbaldy soils are on convex ridge and bench shoulder positions. Redwoodhouse soils are on mountain slope positions dominated by moderately cemented mudstone.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, high runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for commercial timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes coast redwood, Douglas-fir, tan oak, California huckleberry, salal, western swordfern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is moderately extensive.
