MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2004.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Davidson and Hiwassee 
series. Even though these soils typically have a subhorizon with more than 60 percent clay (increasing with depth); overall, they have less than 60 percent clay (weighted average) in the particle-size control section.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 206 centimeters (Bt and BCt horizons)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 15 to 119 centimeters (Bt horizon)
Rhodic color feature--more than 50 percent colors that have hue of 2.5YR or redder and value moist of 3 or less in the upper 75 centimeters of the kandic horizon

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization samples were analyzed and are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (03NC097007)
