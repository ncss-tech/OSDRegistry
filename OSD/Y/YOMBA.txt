YOMBA SERIES

The Yomba series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Yomba soils are on alluvial flats, alluvial plains, fan piedmonts and, inset fans, fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Durinodic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yomba gravelly sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    2Bqk--36 to 51 cm;  light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam , brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard and very hard, friable and firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; very fine tubular pores; few thin silica bridges between sand grains and lining pores; 30 percent gravel; common medium and large distinct white (10YR 8/1) lime masses; few medium and large prominent yellow (10YR 7/6) opal coats on discontinuous laminae; continuous brittle matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (14 to 38 cm thick)

   3C--51 to 152 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) extremely gravelly sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel; very few large distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) iron concretions in 5 cm wide pockets; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yomba soils are on alluvial flats, alluvial plains, fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from rhyolite, basalt, granite, and tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,225 to 1,936 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Belcher, Domez and Stumble soils.  Belcher soils are shallow over tuff.  Domez soils are fine-loamy.  Stumble soils are sandy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very slow to slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally Bailey greasewood, shadscale, Anderson wolfberry, graymolly and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Nevada.  These soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA 29.
