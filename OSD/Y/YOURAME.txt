YOURAME SERIES

The Yourame series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till and colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, moraines, hills, till plains, and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yourame gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed forest litter.

    E1--2 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 15 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.

    E2--6 to 11 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium and coarse granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the E horizons is 8 to 16 inches.)

    E/Bt--11 to 21 inches; E part (about 80 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; which interfingers into B part; B part (about 20 percent) is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; mixed texture is gravelly loam, moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt--21 to 48 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky, and plastic, common very fine, and medium roots; common distinct thick clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent pebbles, neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (17 to 40 inches thick)

    Bk--48 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; 15 percent cobbles; 40 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
