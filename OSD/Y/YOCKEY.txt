YOCKEY SERIES

The Yockey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified, calcareous loamy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, calcareous, mesic Aquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yockey silt loam with a slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches0; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 TO 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) thick)

   AC--20 to 38 centimeters (8 to 15 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 TO 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) thick)

   C--38 to 81 centimeters (15 to 32 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

   Cg--81 to 203 centimeters (32 to 80 inches); stratified, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam and very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) moist iron masses in the soils matrix; massive; slightly hard, very friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Morrill County, Nebraska; about 5 kilometers (3 miles) north and 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) west of Bridgeport; 762 meters (2,500 feet) west and 30 meters (100 feet) south of the northeast corner, sec. 13, T. 20 N., R. 51 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Solum thickness: 10 to 56 centimeters (4 to 22 inches) thick
Free carbonates: typically at the surface, but range from 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) in depth  
Very fine and fine sand fraction: 55 percent volcanic glass, mainly in the control section   

An alkali phase is recognized

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, but include loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and loamy very fine sand 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline 

AC horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 6 or 7, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Textures: typically loam, but include silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and loamy very fine sand 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline 

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 6 to 8, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Textures: typically very fine sandy loam, but include silt loam, loam, and loamy very fine sand 
Weighted average noncarbonate clay in the control section: between 5 and 12 percent, but ranges to 18 percent  
Redox features: distinct or prominent
Textures: below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) can range from fine sandy loam to gravelly sand
Buried surface layers: in the C horizon in some pedons
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: flood plains
Parent material: calcareous, stratified alluvium that is mainly loamy or silty and includes a high percentage of very fine sand
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 51 centimeters (14 to 20 inches)  
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. (47 to 51 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are the Caruso, Craft, Gering, Las Animas, Lisco, McGrew, and Platte soils.  
Craft, Caruso, and Las Animas soils are on similar landscapes. 
Gering soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have mixed sand and gravel between a depth of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches), and are on the same landscape.  
Lisco soils are coarse-loamy and are very strongly alkaline.  
McGrew soils are coarse-loamy, have mixed gravelly sand at depths between 51 to 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches) and are on similar landscapes.  
Platte soils have gravelly sand at depths between 25 to 51 centimeters (10 and 20 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Somewhat poorly drained  
Runoff: slow
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  moderately high  
Flooding: rare or occasional 
Depth to apparent seasonal high water table: 46 to 91 centimeters (1.5 feet to 3 feet) in the spring of most dry years
Water table: highest in late winter or early spring when stream flow is highest, recedes to 91 centimeters (3 feet) by mid summer.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is in cultivated crops and much of this is irrigated.  
A minor acreage is in native grasses.  
The main irrigated crops are corn, sugar beets, alfalfa, and dry edible beans.  A small acreage of dryland winter wheat is grown.  
The dominant species in rangeland are big bluestem, indiangrass, little bluestem, prairie cordgrass, slender wheatgrass, and switchgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Morrill County, Nebraska, 1980.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) (Ap horizon) 
Aquic conditions: saturation and redox features below 81 centimeters (32 inches)

Yockey soils were previously included in the Las series.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Pedon S76NE-123-21 was analyzed in the National Soil Survey Laboratory as sample numbers 76PO787 through 76PO790.

Modified format by LRM in 4/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
