YODER SERIES

The Yoder series consists of deep to very gravelly loamy coarse sand, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in thin sandy medium to moderately fine textured noncalcareous alluvium derived principally from granite bedrock and arkosic deposits.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Yoder gravelly coarse sandy loam in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 15 percent fine and very fine angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches) thick)

  Bt--10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) coarse sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to fine subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; peds are extremely hard, friable; many wax-like patches on faces of some peds and wax-like coatings and fillings on the insides of root channels and pores; 25 percent fine and very fine angular pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 33 centimeters (5 to 13 inches) thick)

  B--30 to 38 centimeters (12 to 15 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to coarse granular; very hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; primary peds are extremely hard; few thin glossy patches on some faces of peds and discontinuous glossy coatings in some root channels and pores; 30 percent fine and very fine angular granite pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches) thick)

  2C--38 to 152 centimeters (15 to 60 inches); very gravelly loamy coarse sand.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elbert County, Colorado; along Highway 24, approximately 0.3 mile southwest of the center of Sec. 16, T. 10 S., R. 58 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to uniformly calcareous material: 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) or more
Depth to the contrasting C horizon: 18 to 61 centimeters (7 to 24 inches)
Depth to the argillic horizon: 5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches)
ESP solum: 0 to 15 percent 
Rock fragments solum: 0 to 35 percent 
Rock fragments 2C horizon: 35 to 80 percent 

The A horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Value:  5 to 7, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 1 to 4.
Texture: gravelly coarse sandy loam
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline 

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 1 to 6
Texture: coarse sandy clay loam, but ranges in 
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent
Silt content: 5 to 40 percent 
Sand content: 40 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: The competing soils are Devargas, Tenorio, and Vernal.
Vernal soils have the sand and gravel substratum at depths of more than 51 centimeters (20 inches) and have hue of 5YR or redder. 
Devargas soils have a lithologic discontinuity of sandy skeletal material at 66 to 102 centimeters (26 to 40 inches).
Tenorio soils have calcareous 2C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: terraces, side slopes and alluvial fans
Slopes: 0 to 6
Parent material: thin sandy medium to moderately fine textured, noncalcareous alluvium derived principally from granite bedrock or arkose deposits
Mean annual precipitation: 33 to 38 centimeters (13 to 15 inches)
Precipitation pattern: peak periods spring and summer
Mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.)
Mean summer temperature is 20 degrees C. (68 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bijou and Truckton soils.
Bijou soils have a moderately coarse textured argillic horizon and have coarse textured C horizons at depths of 51 centimeters (20 inches) or more. 
Truckton soils have mollic epipedons, lack contrasting layers in the substratum and have less clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well to somewhat excessively drained
Runoff: low to very low 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high or very high

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as grazing land and as dry or irrigated cropland.  Native vegetation is fringed sage, cactus, yucca, blue grama, and needle and thread grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Colorado.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: East Elbert County, Colorado, 1964.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile are:
Argillic horizon: 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) (Bt horizon)
Contrasting horizon: 38 to 152 centimeters (15 to 60 inches) (2C horizon)

Soil last updated by the state 4/80. 

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
