YODAL SERIES

The Yodal series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains. These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Yodal soils have moderate permeability. Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 30 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Swifton series. Swifton soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 44 to 46 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - mountain summits, sideslopes and basins above the
forested zone.
Elevation - 7,600 to 9,800 feet.
Slope - 4 to 60 percent.
Parent material - local alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sedimentary bedrock and loess. 
Climate - Precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year. Winter snowpack of 8 to 16 feet in depth and lasting through mid June are common. 
Mean annual temperature - 26 to 34 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation - 30 to 60 inches.
Frost free period - 5 to 30 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fritz and Koffgo series and soils in the fragmental family of Typic Cryochrepts. Fritz soils are on nearby alpine mountain summits. They are derived from limestone and have mollic epipedons over calcic horizons. Koffgo soils are on nearby mountain sideslopes and commonly support forested communities. They average greater than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the particle size control section. The fragmental Typic Cryochrepts are on nearby karst alpine mountain summits. They are derived from limestone and are less than 20 inches deep to fragmental material.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Yodal soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. These soils commonly support subalpine forb communities. The fernleaf licorieroot-duncecap larkspur c.t., nettleleaf giant hyssop-showy goldeneye c.t. are commonly represented. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Wyoming and southeastern Idaho. They are of moderate extent.
