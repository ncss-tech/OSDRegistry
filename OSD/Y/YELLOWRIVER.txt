YELLOWRIVER SERIES

The Yellowriver series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 152 centimeters (20 to 60 inches) of slope alluvium and in the underlying loess. These soils are on base slopes on dissected uplands. Slopes range from 9 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 85 centimeters (33 inches).

argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 122 centimeters (18 to 48 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
