YARDLEY SERIES

The Yardley series consists of very deep soils that were formed in deep alluvial soil material from acid and intermediate igneous rocks. These soils are on gently sloping to sloping alluvial fans and mountain valleys, and steep mountain slopes with slope of 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 19 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Yardley loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    All--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 13 inches thick)

    B21t--10 to 17 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) heavy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium angular blocks; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; moderately continuous clay films; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    B22t--17 to 46 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) heavy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse angular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine angular blocks; very hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; few thin clay films; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 30 inches thick)

    C--46 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/3) heavy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure that parts to weak fine angular blocks; very hard, friable, slightly sticky, plastic; few fine roots; common fine pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7).

TYPE LOCATION: Beaver County, Utah; 2 miles north from Beaver Post Office, 12.6 miles northwest to junction, then 0.9 mile southwest; sec.  34, T.27S., R.8W.

RANGE AND CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is more than 30 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 61 degrees F. The CEC/clay ratio is less than 0.6. These soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. but are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 6 out of 10 years.

The Al horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.

The B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value in the upper part of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The lower part has value of 5 through 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist.  Moist value darker than 4 extends to less than 20 inches. The B2t horizon is heavy clay loam or light clay containing 35 to 60 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. It has strong medium prismatic to moderate fine or medium angular blocky structure. This horizon is very hard, firm, sticky or slightly sticky and plastic or slightly plastic.  It is 24 to 40 inches thick.

The C horizon is heavy loam and contains minor amounts of gravel and cobble in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Harkers, Manila, Maple Mountain, and Rob Roy series. Harkers soils have gravelly or cobbly B2t horizons, and they have montmorillonitic mineralogy Manila soils have a solum that is over 50 inches thick and have montmorillonitic mineralogy. Maple Mountain soils have less than 35 percent clay in the B2t horizons and have 20 to 40 percent cobbles. Rob Roy soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock.

SETTING: Yardley soils are on gently sloping to sloping alluvial fans and mountain valleys, and steep mountain slopes with gradients commonly of 1 to 6 percent, but ranging from 1 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,700 to 7,700 feet. The soils formed in deep alluvial soil material from acid and intermediate igneous rocks. The climate is moist subhumid. Mean annual temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches. The frost-free period is 65 to 85 days.

PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Maple Mountain soils and Wallsburg soils. Wallsburg soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches and contain more than 50 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for watershed, wildlife grazing, spring grazing by sheep and summer grazing by cattle. The present vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, Gambel oak, cheatgrass, and yellowbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountain areas of southwestern Utah. This series is inextensive.
