YORK SERIES

Soils of the York series are deep and moderately well drained with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in the weathered product of acid rock mostly sericite schist.  These soils are on uplands of the Piedmont Province.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is above 59 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Fragiudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  York silt loam - in a mixed hardwood and pine forest. (Colors are for moist soil.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed leaves, pine needles, and twigs and other organic material.

    A--2 to 4 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; 2 percent quartz pebbles up to 1 inch in diameter; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to thick)

    E--4 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; 2 percent quartz pebbles up mm to 1 inch in diameter; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    BE--10 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky; common fine and medium and few large roots; 2 percent quartz pebbles up to 1 inch in diameter; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--14 to 28 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky; common thin films of clay on faces of peds; common fine, medium and few large roots; 2 percent quartz pebbles up to 1 inch in diameter; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bx--28 to 42 inches; olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) silt loam; common fine distinct pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) and light gray (2.5Y 7/2) mottles; weak medium platy structure; firm, brittle, slightly sticky; common vesicular pores; 10 percent quartz pebbles up to 1 inch in diameter; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    BC--42 to 55 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), yellowish brown 10YR 5/8), and yellowish red (5YR 5/8) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky; 5 percent quartz pebbles up to 3 inches in diameter; strongly acid; diffuse boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    C--55 to 82 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), gray (N 6/), and red (2.5YR 5/8) silty clay loam; massive; 15 percent strongly weathered schist fragments; strongly acid.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    R--82 inches; hard light gray sericite schist.

TYPE LOCATION:  Orange County, Virginia; 1 mile west of junction of Highways 725 and 20 in woodland; 3 miles northeast of village of Nason.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is deeper than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from about 18 to 36 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless limed.  Coarse fragments of mostly sericite schist range from 5 to 15 percent in the textural control section.  Flakes of mica are in some pedons.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, chroma of 2 through 6.  The A horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6, mottles with chromas of 2 or less may be present below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  The Bt horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam.  Silt plus very fine sand is more than 40 percent.

The Bx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma 2 through 6.  The Bx horizon is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.

The BC and the C horizons are multicolored and are silt loam, silty clay loam or loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Bourne series is the only member of the same family.  Bourne soils do not have coarse fragments or have rounded quartz pebbles and do not have sericite schist coarse fragments or have rounded quartz pebbles and do not have sericite schist coarse fragments.

The Beltsville, Cane, Colfax, Gills, Fairfax, Ora and Savanna series are in closely related families.  Beltsville soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.  Cane, Ora and Savanna soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Colfax soils have mottles with chromas of 2 or less within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Gills soils have clayey B2t horizons above the fragipan.  Fairfax soils do not have a fragipan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  York soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands.  Slopes are dominantly 2 and 7 percent but ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils developed in medium and moderately fine textured acid.  Weathered mostly from sericite schist or similar fine textured rock.  Mean annual precipitation is ranges from 36 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is ranges from 59 degrees F to 70 degrees F.

PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Alamance, Georgeville, Goldston, Herndon, Lignum, Manteo, Nason, and Tatum series.  Alamance soils do not have a fragipan.  Georgeville, Herndon, Lignum, Nason and Tatum soils have clayey Bt horizons and do not have fragipans.  Goldston and Manteo soils contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the textural control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderate well drained; medium to slow runoff; slow permeability is moderately slow in the fragipan layer.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for forest and pasture with a small acreage in cultivation.  Crops grown include corn, mixed hay, and small grain.  Native vegetation consists of oaks, hickory, sweetgum, Virginia and shortleaf pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  In Virginia and possibly North Carolina.  The series is of small extent.
