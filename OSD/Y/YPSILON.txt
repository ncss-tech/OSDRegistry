YPSILON SERIES

The Ypsilon series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Ypsilon soils are on glaciated mountain slopes and moraines.  Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, isotic Typic Haplocryods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ypsilon gravelly coarse sandy loam, on a north facing, concave, 39 percent slope in coniferous forest at an elevation of 10,375 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 18, 1997 the soil was moist throughout.

    The surface is covered by undecomposed needles, twigs and cones.

(5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bs2--24 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely stony sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky and moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, weakly cemented by iron, brittle, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine to coarse roots; few distinct continuous iron stains on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.7); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 17 inches thick)

    BC--35 to 67 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium roots; 20 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.7).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  The Deception(AK), Dinzer(OR), Homestead(AK), Kniklik(AK), Lastance(OR), Mt. Hood(OR), Remedios(AK), and Whetstone(OR) series are in a closely related family.  Deception, Homestead, and Kniklik soils are silty in the upper part of the profile.  Dinzer soils are assumed to have less than 15 percent mica.  Lastance and Mt. Hood soils have a solum less than 30 inches thick and are assumed to have less than 15 percent mica.  Remedios soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Whetstone soil have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Larimer County, Colorado, Rocky Mountain National Park soil survey area, 1999.  The name was taken from a mountain and lake in the area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Albic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 19 inches.  (E horizons)
Spodic horizon:  The zone from 19 to 35 inches.  (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons)
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 16 to 46 inches.  (part of the E2, Bs1, Bs2, and part of the BC horizons)

This series was projected to be in the paramicaceous family, but laboratory data has not substantiated this to date.
