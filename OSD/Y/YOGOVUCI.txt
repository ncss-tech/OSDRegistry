YOGOVUCI SERIES

The Yogovuci series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone overlying old alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Yogovuci soils are on fan remnants and paleoterraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Chimrock (CO), Fruita (CO), and Fruitvale (CO) series.  Chimrock soils are derived from shale and sandstone and have 2.5Y hue in the lower part of the profile. Fruita soils have more than 15 percent by weight gypsum in the gypsic horizon. Fruitvale soils have clayey substrata.

Parent material: eolian deposits derived from sandstone overlying alluvium derived from igneous materials
Landform:  fan remnants and paleoterraces

Elevation:  4,800 to 5,700 feet
Mean annual temperature:  52 to 56 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  7 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern:  uniform with slight dip in May and June and slight increase in July and August
Frost-free period:  135 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gypsey, Persayo, and Taqoci series.  The Gypsey soils are moderately deep to shale, and the Persayo soils are shallow to shale.  Both are on pediments.  The Taqoci soils have a natric horizon and are on alluvial fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium or high runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  They are used as grazing land and, to a limited extent, irrigated agriculture.  Native vegetation is galleta, shadscale, alkali sacaton, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado; MLRA 35. This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Montezuma County, Colorado, Ute Mountain Area, Colorado and New Mexico, 2005. The name is derived from a Ute word for coyote.
