REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (Ap horizon)

These soils are assumed to have originally classified as fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls.  However, because of severe erosion, these soils no longer have the thick dark surface soil necessary for this classification.  In addition, the part of the soil containing the most clay is now at or near the surface.  These changes have a significant affect on the use and management of these soils.

11/2005 JCR LM changed to semi-tab format, added metric conversion and saturated hydraulic conductivity.
