YORKNORTH SERIES

The Yorknorth series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from chloritic schist and other sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Yorknorth soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1650 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yorknorth soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Yorknorth soils are on concave to linear slopes. Elevations range from 60 to 760 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum. Landscapes dominated by Yorknorth soils have hummocky relief, sag ponds, slips, and intermittent springs. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 11 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 21 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free period is about 240 to 280 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coolyork, Dryfield, and Witherell soils. Witherell soils have fractured bedrock above 50 centimeters and are on convex positions. Dryfield soils contain less than 35 percent clay in the control section and occur on linear to slightly convex positions. Coolyork soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 15 degrees C and are under forest vegetation. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; high to very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for livestock grazing, watershed, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is wild oat, slender oat, ripgut brome, soft brome, dogtsail grass, California oatgrass, blue wildrye, medusahead, rat-tail fescue, common sheep sorrel, hairy catsear, burclover, pale flax, pennyroyal,and western rush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The soils are moderately extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 31 centimeters (A, Bt1 horizons) 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 112 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)

This soil has a moist phase when used in MLRA 4B, where cooler summers are due to a marine layer influence.
