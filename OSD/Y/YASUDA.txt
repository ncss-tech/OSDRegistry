REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 32 to 107 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Redoximorphic iron concentrations--Bng1 and Bng2 horizons
*Redoximorphic iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less--Bng1 horizon
*Reduced matrix--Bng1, Bng2, Bng3 horizons
*Aquic conditions--Bng1, Bng2, Bng3 horizons
At least one horizon between 20 to 50 cm depth must have less than 8 percent clay, or have an n value of 0.7 or less.
Exchangeable sodium percentage of 15 or more in Bng1 and Bng2 horizons are inferred from reaction over 8.5 and lab data from similar pedons; see user pedon IDs S2014AK290010, S2014AK2903052, and S2015AK290009 in the NCSS database for supporting chemical data.
