YODY SERIES 

The Yody series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Yody soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aquinas, Boulflat, Cherry Spring, Eastval, Spasprey, and Zaidy series. 

Aquinas soils do not have calcic horizons and have duripans that formed in lacustrine deposits within 100 cm of the soil surface. Boulflat soils do not have calcic horizons and have duripans overlying lithic contacts within 100 cm of the soil surface. Cherry Spring soils have less than 35 percent sand in the particle-size control section and do not have calcic horizons. Eastval soils do not have calcic horizons.  Spasprey and Zaidy soils do not have calcic horizons and have duripans at depths of 50 to 76 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yody soils are on fan remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,616 to 2,196 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Abgese soil. Abgese soils are fine-loamy, very deep, have argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent fan remnants. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Yody soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada. These soils are extensive with about 102,000 acres of the series mapped to date. The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 28B, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 27.
