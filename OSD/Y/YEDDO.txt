YEDDO SERIES

The Yeddo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess and are underlain by loamy till at a depth of greater than 152 cm (60 inches). Yeddo soils are on till plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are Aptakisic, Caseyville, Creal, Fitchville, Iva, Kendall, Starks, Stronghurst, and Waynetown series. Aptakisic, Fitchville, Kendall, and Starks soils average more than 10 percent sand in some horizon within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Caseyville, Iva, and Stronghurst soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 140 cm (55 inches). Creal soils are more than 61 cm (24 inches) to the top of the argillic horizon. Waynetown soils have rock fragments within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yeddo soils are on loess covered till plains or outwash plains (See REMARKS) that have a slightly convex surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Yeddo soils formed in more than 152 cm (60 inches) of loess and are underlain by loam or silt loam till within a depth of 203 cm (80 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alford, Birkbeck, Camden, Fincastle, Iona, Ragsdale, Reesville, St. Charles, Sylvan, Whitson, and Xenia soils. The well drained Alford and Sylvan soils are typically on steeper slopes. The moderately well drained Birkbeck and Xenia soils, the well drained Camden and St. Charles soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Fincastle and Reesville soils have a thinner loess mantle. The moderately well drained Iona soils have profiles that are less gray. The poorly drained Ragsdale soils have mollic epipedons and are in concave positions. The poorly drained Whitson soils have dominantly gray profiles and are in lower lying areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) during the winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the loess and moderately slow in the underlying till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, and meadow are the main crops. A relatively small proportion is in permanent pasture or in woodland. In areas that are forested, oaks and maple are the most common tree species. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111D and 114B in south-central and western Indiana. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of moderate extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fountain County, Indiana, 1999.

REMARKS: These soils were originally mapped as Reesville series. Results of field investigation indicate the till is not within the solum and is below a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). These properties are outside the concept for Reesville soils. Many other areas of Reesville soils in western Indiana will likely also be converted to Yeddo series. The underlying till material is outside the series control section. In addition to occurring on till plains and outwash plains in the area of the typical pedon, these soils will likely be mapped on lake plains in unglaciated areas in Indiana and in Illinois.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap and E horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 86 cm (Btg, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Aquic conditions: redox depletions and/or redox concentrations in all horizons below a depth of 20 cm.

Representative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153429 in MO 11.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Typical Pedon sampled for Purdue University Lab, West Lafayette, Indiana, Soil No. S80IN107-15-(1-7). Additional laboratory characterization data include; S59IN23-1-(1-9), S59IN23-8-(1-9), S76IN83-11-(1-6), S80IN125-28-(1-6), and S84IN171-11-(1-7).
