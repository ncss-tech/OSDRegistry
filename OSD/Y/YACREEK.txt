YACREEK SERIES

The Yacreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits over alluvium.  These soils occur on fan remnants and lake beds.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Yacreek loam, in rangeland on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 2,029 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 14 cm thick)

 Bt--10 to 31 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; 45 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

 Bk--31 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; 70 percent fine distinct irregular calcium carbonate coats around rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 20 cm thick)

 2BCk--48 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 65 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; 60 percent fine distinct irregular calcium carbonate coats around rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

Slope - 0 to 8 percent
Parent material - alluvium or lacustrine deposits over alluvium
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; short warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 380 to 480 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 4 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately over rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Yacreek soils are used as native rangeland.  Native vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, prairie junegrass, poa (species), threetip sagebrush, and other miscellaneous grasses and forbs.
