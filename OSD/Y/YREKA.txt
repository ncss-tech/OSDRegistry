YREKA SERIES

The Yreka series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from mixed rock sources. These soils are on alluvial fans, ridges, mountains, hills, and moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Yreka gravelly loam, forested, colors are for dry colors unless otherwise noted.

    Oi--to 5 cm; partially decomposed twigs and needles. (2 to 8 cm thick)

    E--5 to 36 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 32 cm thick)

    E/Bt--36 to 50 cm; E part (60 percent) is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; Bt part (40 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium, and few coarse roots; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt--50 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral.
