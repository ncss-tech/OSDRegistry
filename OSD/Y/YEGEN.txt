YEGEN SERIES

The Yegen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick alluvial or eolian deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

(6 to 18 inches thick)

    BC--34 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beartooth (MT), Beeno (WY), Bielenberg (T)(MT), Bookcliff (UT), Bullflat (SD), Cortyzack (CO), Dooley (MT), Empedrado (CO), Fairfield (MT), Farnuf (MT), Felor (SD), Greenway (SD), Gurney (SD), Hangdo (UT), Hyalite (MT), Krem (ND), Lefor (ND), Lininger (CO), Livona (ND), Martinsdale (MT), Maudlin (CO), Moen (CO), Reeder (ND), Sponseller (AZ), Trag (CO), Tschicoma (NM), Ulrant (WY), Vida (MT), Watrous (ND), Wemple (MT), and Williams (ND) series.  The Bielenberg soils do not have carbonates above 60 inches.  Bookcliff soils have hard sandstone between depths of 40 and 60 inches and the depth to carbonates is 20 inches or less.  Bullflat soils have a discontinuity above 40 inches.  Cortyzack, Lairfield, Martinsdale, Trag, and Ulrant soils have a calcic horizon.  Empedrado and Livona soils are more than 20 inches deep to lime.  The Farnuf soils have less than 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Lefor and Greenway soils have a discontinuity in the argillic horizon.  Hyalite soils have a skeletal discontinuity above 40 inches.  The Gurney, Maudlin, Moen, and Watrous soils have a lithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Beeno, Lifor, Lininger, Reeder, and Wemple soils have a paralithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hangdo soils have hues redder than 10YR throughout the profile and are mildly or moderately alkaline.  Krem soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick.  Sponseller soils have hues redder than 10YR throughout the soil and have less than 45 percent sand in the argillic horizon.  Tschicoma soils have rock fragments that are mainly stones to a depth of 40 inches and have argillic horizons that have hues of 7.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Yegen soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Elevations are 1,900 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in thick alluvial or eolian deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist spring; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yegen soils are used mainly for nonirrigated small grains.  Potential native vegetation is mainly needleandthread and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Yegen soils are moderately extensive in central and eastern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carbon County (Bridger Area), Montana, 1971.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0205, MT0257, and MT1102.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 13 inches (Ap, Bt1 horizon); an argillic horizon from 6 to 28 inches of which the upper 20 inches are the particle-size control section (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons); a horizon of carbonate accumulation from 28 to 34 inches (Bk horizon).  Yegen soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
