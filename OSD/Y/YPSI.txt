YPSI SERIES

The Ypsi series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy lacustrine deposits overlying clayey till or lacustrine deposits. Ypsi soils are on lake plains, terraces, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over clayey, mixed, semiactive, mesic Udollic Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Ypsi sandy loam, on a convex, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bw [B1]--23 to 36 cm (9 to 14 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; few dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) concretions; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 Bt1 [B21t]--36 to 53 cm (14 to 21 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few thin discontinuous light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; clay bridging between sand grains; continuous light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) surfaces on faces of peds; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2 [B22t]--53 to 74 cm (21 to 29 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few thin discontinuous light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; clay bridging between sand grains; continuous light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) surfaces on faces of peds; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the B2 horizon is 20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 inches).]

 BC [B3]--74 to 94 cm (29 to 37 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; very few fine roots; ; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) surfaces on peds; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; less than 5 percent rock fragments; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 30 cm (12 inches) thick]

 2Cg1 [IIC1g]--94 to 130 cm (37 to 51 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay; weak medium angular blocky structure; firm; common medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; less than 5 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches) thick]

 2Cg2 [IIC2g]--130 to 152 cm (51 to 60 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay; massive; firm; less than 5 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: No other series are in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ypsi soils are on lake plains, terraces, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in loamy lacustrine deposits overlying clayey till or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Ypsi soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the moderately well drained Seward soils and poorly drained or very poorly drained Wauseon soils. They are associated with the Nappanee and Hoytville soils on ground moraines and the Fulton and Toledo soils on lake plains. The Nappanee, Hoytville, Fulton, and Toledo soils are not loamy sand or sandy loam in the upper part of the control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy part and moderately low in the clayey part. Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy part of the pedon and slow in the clayey part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are cultivated in most areas. Corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume-grass hay are the principal crops. Soils are used for permanent pasture or forest in a few areas. Native vegetation is hardwoods, principally elm, oak, hickory, basswood, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111B in southeastern Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.
