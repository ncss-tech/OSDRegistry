YIPPIN SERIES

The Yippin series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous sources.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on erosional remnants on fan piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

REMARKS: 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bw1, Bw2, Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 2 inches.  (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)

Cambic horizon:  The zone from 2 to 15 inches.  (Bw1 and 
Bw2 horizons)

Calcic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 45 inches.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
