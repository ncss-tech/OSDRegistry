YAPLE SERIES 

The Yaple series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, alluvial fans, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.
