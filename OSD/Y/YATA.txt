YATA SERIES

The Yata series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Yata soils are on cuestas and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 50 to 80 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yata loam, woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine vesicular pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--8 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 - 20 to 40 cm)

    Bt1--25 to 53 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) cobbly silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium and few large roots; few very fine continuous tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  

    Bt2--53 to 79 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine continuous tubular pores; common stress cutans; few moderately thick clay films lining pores, many thick clay films coating rock fragments; 20 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 - 50 to 80 cm)

    Bt3--79 to 152 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very cobbly silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine continuous pores; few moderately thick clay films lining pores and many thick clay films on rock fragments; 30 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  
Beachcanyon (CO) - have a udic soil moisture regime

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - cuestas and mountain slopes
Elevation - 2,470 to 2,960 meters
Slopes - 50 to 80 percent
Parent material - colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks; rock fragments are often well rounded  
Mean annual precipitation - 630 to 710 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 1.5 to 4.4 degrees C.
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yata soils are used for wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is Douglas-fir, white fir, Gambel oak, snowberry, and Arizona fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central New Mexico, Southern Colorado, Wyoming; LRR D, E; MLRA 36, 43B, 48A; moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, 1989.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon and Pachic feature - 0 to 53 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - 25 to 152 cm (Bt horizons)

The moisture regime and subclass is unclear as of the 06/2006 revision. It is assumed to be an ustic regime bordering udic, but may possibly be a udic regime. This series needs further investigation of climate regimes.
