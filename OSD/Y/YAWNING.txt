YAWNING SERIES

The Yawning series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in thin volcanic ash mantles overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Yawning soils are found on slopes of 0 to 65 percent on debris aprons, valley walls, and terraces of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Typic Haplocryods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yawning ashy sandy loam, located on a forested southwest facing valley wall with a slope of 65 percent and an elevation of 1350 meters.  When described on August 28, 2006 the soil was slightly moist throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dinzer, Lastance, Mt. Hood and Ypsilon series.  Dinzer and Lastance soils are deep (100 to 150 centimeters) to a lithic contact and lack andic soil properties.  Mt. Hood soils are formed from glacial till derived from porphyritic andesitic and basaltic rocks.  Ypsilon soils are somewhat excessively drained, lack andic soil properties and range in elevation from 2950 to 3350 meters.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yawning soils are found on slopes of 0 to 65 percent on valley walls, debris aprons, and terraces of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 700 to 1,350 meters.  They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,450 to 2,200 millimeters and mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C. Frost free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilliwack, Spickard and Tepeh soils.  Chilliwack soils are medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have a mantle of andic soil materials 25 to 35 cm thick.  Spickard soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and lack albic and spodic horizon morphology.  Chilliwack and Spickard soils are typically found on more stable and lower slope gradient landscape positions.  Tepeh soils are found on more active landscape positions, have a mantle of andic soil materials 25 to 35 cm thick, and lack albic and spodic horizon morphology.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yawning soils are used for wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Native vegetation consists of Pacific silver fir and western hemlock with an understory of black huckleberry, five-leaf bramble and queenscup beadlilly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
