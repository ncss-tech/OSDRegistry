YERINGTON SERIES

The Yerington series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sand and alluvium derived from mixed rocks or granitic rocks. Yerington soils are on sand sheets, plains, and fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yerington loamy fine sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 20 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 30 cm thick)

    C1--20 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 60 cm thick)

    C2--48 to 69 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Bqkb--69 to 114 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 10 percent large firm durinodes; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 50 cm thick)

    Bkb--114 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada; about 4.5 miles southeast of Yerington; 200 feet south of the northeast corner of section 32, T.13 N., R 26 E..; USGS Yerington NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 57 minutes 12 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 5 minutes 20 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9536111 latitude, -119.0890278 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and early spring, dry for the remainder of the year; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to buried horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates: 30 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Rock fragments: Averages 0 to 15 percent, mainly gravel of mixed or granitic lithology.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Platy or single grain.
Consistence:  Soft or loose.
Reaction - Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Other features:  Some pedons have few lamellae less than 1 cm thick.

C horizons 
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Stratified loamy coarse sand to very fine sandy loam.
Rock fragments:  Up to 20 percent pebbles.
Structure:  Massive or single grain.

Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Stratified loamy coarse sand to very fine sandy loam.
Rock fragments:  Up to 20 percent pebbles in some pedons.
Structure:  Massive or single grain.
Consistence:  Soft or loose.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.
Other features:  Some pedons have horizons with less than 20 percent durinodes 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aneth, Luning, Shumbegay, Soda Lake, and Soolake series.  

Aneth and Shumbegay soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Luning soils do not have buried B horizons in the particle-size control section with texture of sandy loam or finer and have subhorizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments. Soda Lake soils are derived primarily from pyroclastic materials and have appreciable amounts of volcanic glass in the particle-size control section. Soolake soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 9 to 12 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yerington soils are on sand sheets, plains, and fan remnants. They formed in eolian sand and alluvium derived from mixed rocks or granitic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,585 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Malpais, Theon, and Tocan soils. Malpais soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, and have cambic horizons. Theon soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons. Tocan soils are fine-loamy, very deep, and have argillic horizons and underlying Bq horizons with durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low surface runoff; rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yerington soils are used for rangeland, irrigated cropland, and wildlife habitat. Cultivated crops are alfalfa, barley, wheat, potatoes, onions, and garlic. The rangeland vegetation is mainly Indian ricegrass, dalea, Douglas rabbitbrush, fourwing saltbush, and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 27.
