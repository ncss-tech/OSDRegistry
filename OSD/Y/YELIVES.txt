YELIVES SERIES 

The Yelives series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium and stream alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. Yelives soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides and floodplains on valley floors. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Yelives fine sandy loam--on a alluvial fan with 3 percent slope at 5,720 feet elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

    A--0 to 2 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak very fine granular structure; loose, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 2 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    Ck1--2 to 12 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; pockets of very finely stratified silt; 2 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; few very fine masses of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    Ck2--12 to 30 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; few very fine masses of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Ck horizons 0 to 28 inches)

    C1--30 to 41 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loamy fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 1 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C2--41 to 56 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loamy fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 10 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C3--56 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) loamy fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; fine stratification of silts and very fine sands; 1 percent gravel; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 30 to 60 inches) 

TYPE LOCATION: San Juan County, New Mexico; on the Navajo Indian Reservation about 4 miles northwest of White Rock, New Mexico; The Pillar 3 NE Quadrangle; R.13 W. and T.22 N.; UTM's 7-38-200 and 40-02-650; 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: The SMCS is usually dry, in all parts, more than 150 cumulative days from April through October. It is usually moist, in some part, less than 50 cumulative days during the same period. It is intermittently moist in some part November through March. The period of maximum precipitation is July through October. The soil is driest during April, May and June. Typic Aridic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 52 to 57 degrees F.

Particle size control section: 8 to 20 percent clay. 

Rock fragment content: 0 to 10 percent sandstone and porcelanite gravel.

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent; calcareous throughout

Salinity: EC of 0 to 2 mmhos/cm.

Sodicity: SAR of 0 to 4.

Reaction: Slightly to moderately alkaline

A Horizon
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR

Ck and C horizons
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR

COMPETING SERIES: Current competitors are the Cirac (NV), Eghelm (CO), Gilco (NM), Glenton (WY), Ives (AZ), Juva (NV), Neskahi (UT) and Thoroughfare (CO) series.  Cirac and Juva soils are strongly to very strongly alkaline with SARs of more than 13.  Glenton soils are cooler with mean annual air temperatures of 45 to 49. Eghelm, Gilco, Ives, Neskahi, and Thoroughfare do not have hues yellower than 10YR. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yelives soils are on alluvial fans on valley sides and flood plains on valley floors. These soils formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jeddito, Notal, and the Razito soils. Jeddito and Notal soils are on stream terraces of valley bottoms and are moderately coarse and fine textured, respectively. The Razito soils are on dunes on natural levees on low stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, low runoff, moderate or moderately rapid permeability. These soils are subject to occasional, very brief periods of flooding between July and September.

USE AND VEGETATION: Yelives soils are used for rangeland. Present vegetation is alkali sacaton, galleta, Indian ricegrass, fourwing saltbush, and broom snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central, New Mexico. LRR-D; MLRA 35. This series is of small extent.
