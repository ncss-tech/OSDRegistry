YAGGY SERIES 


The Yaggy series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). They formed in stratified loamy alluvium over sand. Permeability is moderate over rapid. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Imano, Saxman, and Willowbrook soils. Imano soils have a mollic epipedon, and are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, and are more than 20 inches (50 centimeters) deep to sand. They are on similar positions. The moderately well drained, Saxman soils are sandy throughout, and are on terraces. Willowbrook soils have a mollic epipedon and are not finely stratified in the upper 19 inches (49 centimeters). They are slightly higher on the floodplain.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow. Permeability is moderate over rapid. A seasonal high water table is at an upper limit of 14 to 24 inches (36 to 61 centimeters). 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is in rangeland. A small acreage is cultivated, both dryland and irrigated. Wheat, grain sorghum, and alfalfa are the main crops. Native vegetation is tall grasses with a sparse stand of trees and brush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is of small extent.
