YETI SERIES

The Yeti series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Yeti soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is approximately 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is approximately 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bentilla, Cunniff, and Klooqueh series. Bentilla soils are less than 100 centimeters (40 inches) to redoximorphic features. The Cunniff and Klooqueh soils have rounded to subrounded rock fragments. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yeti soils occur on broad ridges, hillslopes and upper, mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 30 percent. Elevations are 3 to 395 meters (5 to 1295 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1650 to 2290 millimeters (65 to 90 inches). Mean winter temperature (December, January, and February) is approximately 9 degrees C; mean summer temperature (June, July, and August) is approximately 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sasquatch and Sisterrocks soils. Sasquatch is fine-loamy.  Sisterrocks is loamy-skeletal. The Sasquatch soils are found in concave positions or below Yeti on steeper slopes. The Sisterrocks soils are found below Yeti on convex slopes or on spur ridges above Yeti.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately low to low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for commercial timber, recreation, wildlife, and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of redwood, Douglas-fir, western hemlock, Sitka Spruce, tanoak, Pacific rhododendron, evergreen huckleberry, salal, salmonberry, western sword fern, and redwood sorrel.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
