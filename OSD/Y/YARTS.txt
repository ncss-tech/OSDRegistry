YARTS SERIES

The Yarts series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and shale. Yarts soils are on structural benches, terraces, hills, alluvial flats and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Yarts fine sandy loam on rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A--0 to 3 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak thick platy structure; loose, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and fine roots; strongly effervescent; disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--3 to 10 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 50 inches thick)

    C2--10 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; strongly effervescent; disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Wayne County, Utah; Robbers Roost Flats north of Eckers Cabin, northwest 1/4 of sec. 31, T. 28 S., R. 15 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on ustic
Mean annual soil temperature - 48 to 54 degrees

Particle-size control section: 5 to 18 percent clay (average)

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 (3 to 6 moist)
Chroma: 3 to 8
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent

C horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR to 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 8 (3 to 7 moist)
Chroma: 3 to 8
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cliff, Councelor, Henrieville, Keeline, Nelman, Nelson, Oterodry, Shedado, Turnercrest, Uendal, and Zia series. A potential competitor that does not yet have CEA class assigned is the Pedrick series. Cliff soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y. Councelor, Oterodry, and Zia soils have visible secondary calcium carbonates above 40 inches. Henrieville, Keeline, Pedrick, and Turnercrest soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR.  Nelman, Nelson, Shedado and Uendal soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and shale
Landform: structural benches, terraces, hills, and alluvial flats, and fans
Slopes: 0 to 10 percent
Elevation: 4,900 to 7,000 feet
Mean annual temperature: 44 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 13 inches
Frost-free period: 110 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Begay, Mellenthin, Mespun, Rizno and the competing Shedado soils.  Begay soils have a cambic horizon.  Mespun soils have a sandy particle-size control section. Mellenthin and Rizno soils have a lithic contact of depths less than 20 inches.  Mellenthin soils also have a calcic horizon.  Shedado soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, negligible to medium runoff, moderately slow to moderately rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland, wildlife habitat and irrigated crops.  The potential vegetation is needleandthread, bottlebrush squirreltail, bud sagebrush, fourwing saltbush, and shadscale.  Principal crops are alfalfa and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central and eastern Utah, western Colorado, and southern Wyoming.  LRR D, MLRA 34A, 36.  This series is of moderate extent.
