GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yaney soils are on stream terraces.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,280 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 13.9 to 16.1 degrees C., mean January temperature is about 4.4 degrees C., and the mean July temperature is about 26.7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blindspring, Sabies, and Seaman soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yaney soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is shadscale, black greasewood, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central California in the Owens Valley.  These soils are not extensive with about 2,900 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 29.
