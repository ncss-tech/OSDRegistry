YELLOWLAKE SERIES

The Yellowlake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey lacustrine sediments of the Tahoka Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on lake terraces 5 to 10 feet above the floors of salina basins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the similar Cedarlake series and the Arch, Arvana, Berda, Creta, Drake, Midessa, Portales, Potter, Veal, and Yellowhouse series.
Cedarlake soils are on slightly lower landscape positions, have aquic conditions, and have a calcic horizon.  
Arvana soils are on higher landscape positions and have a petrocalcic horizon.  
Arch and Portales soils are on similar landscape positions and have 18 to 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.
Creta soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a paralithic contact within 60 to 80 inches of the soil surface.  
Berda, Drake, and Midessa soils are on higher landscape positions and have less than 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.  
Potter and Veal soils are on higher landscape positions and have carbonatic mineralogy.
Yellowhouse soils are on slightly higher landscape positions, have a paralithic contact within 20 to 40 inches of the soil surface, and have an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Very slow permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  This is a short and mid grass site with a good variety of forbs and a smaller woody plant component.  Major grass species are black grama, dropseed, western wheatgrass, alkali muhly, inland saltgrass, sideoats grama, and some buffalograss.  Forbs include dotted gayfeather, sensitive briar, and bush sunflower.  Cholla, prickly pear, and mesquite are the major woody species.  In extremely saline areas, vegetation is sparse.  This soil has been correlated to the Wet Saline (077CY689TX) range site in MLRA-77.
			
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Southern High Plains of western Texas (sub-MLRA-77E).  The series is of minor extent.
