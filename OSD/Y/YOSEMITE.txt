YOSEMITE SERIES

The Yosemite series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with moderately rapid permeability.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and are on narrow flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, mesic Fluventic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yosemite gravelly silt loam - on a 1 percent slope in a pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

     Ap--0 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; common fine roots; 33 percent gravel; medium acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

     Bw--10 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam; few fine distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; 37 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 14 inches thick)

     Bg1--17 to 23 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loam; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; 65 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

     Bg2--23 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loam; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; 80 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizons is 11 to 25 inches)

     Cg1--31 to 43 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly clay loam; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; single grain; loose; few distinct dark organic coatings on upper surfaces of rock fragments; 84 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

     Cg2--43 to 64 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; single grain; loose; 83 percent gravel; neutral. (Combined thickness of the Cg horizons is 20 to 40 inches or more).

TYPE LOCATION:  Casey County, Kentucky; 2 miles east of Bethelridge, Kentucky, 250 feet north of Russell Creek; on Science Hill USGS Quadrangle; about 2,297,500 feet east and about 332,500 feet north by the Kentucky coordinate grid system.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 15 to 35 percent in the Ap horizon, 20 to 40 percent in the Bw horizon, 35 to 80 percent in the Bg horizon, and 35 to 85 percent in the Cg horizon.

The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine earth is silt loam or loam.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles are in shades of brown and gray.  Texture of the fine earth is loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam.

The Bg horizon has matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the fine earth is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.

The Cg horizon has matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of gray and brown.  Texture of the fine earth is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Series in closely related families are the Newark, Sensabaugh, Skidmore and Stokly soils.  Newark soils are in a fine-silty family.  Sensabaugh soils are well drained and in a fine-loamy family.  The Skidmore soils are well drained.  Stokly soils are in a coarse-loamy family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yosemite soils are on nearly level flood plains of small streams.  These soils formed in mixed
alluvium of limestone, siltstone, sandstone, and shale origin.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They are subject to occasional and frequent floods of very brief duration.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the closely related Newark and Skidmore soils on the flood plains are the Lindside, Melvin, and Nolin soils.  The Lindside soils are moderately well drained, the Melvin soils are poorly drained, and the Nolin soils are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is medium.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for pasture and hay.  Corn, tobacco, and vegetables are the principle row crops.  Native vegetation was mostly water-tolerant mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Yosemite soils are in south-central Kentucky.  The extent is small.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED:  Casey County, Kentucky, 1988.  Source of name is a small town in Casey County.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - Ap--0 to 10 inches.

Loamy-skeletal feature - greater than 35 percent by volume weighted average rock fragments in the particle size control section.

These soils were formerly mapped as Newark gravelly variant or as gravelly Newark or gravelly Lindside soils.
