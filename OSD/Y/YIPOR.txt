YIPOR SERIES

The Yipor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with admixture of loess.  These soils are on inset fans, fan skirts and lake plain terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yipor silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate thin and medium platy; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine vesicular, and common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear irregular boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 20 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 cm thick)

    C1--20 to 46 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual smooth boundary. (13 to 30 cm thick)

    C2--46 to 97 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and very few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 55 cm thick)

    Cy--97 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common fine rounded gypsum crystals; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 8.5 miles southeast of Battle Mountain, about 2,600 feet west and 0.4 mile south of the northeast corner of section 17, T. 31 N., R. 46 E.; USGS Bateman Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 33 minutes 40 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 48 minutes 52 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.5611111 latitude, -116.8144444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in winter and early spring, dry early May through mid-November; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent throughout the profile.
Salt and sodium: Normally moderately or strongly saline-sodic affected.  Some pedons are commonly non or slightly saline-alkali affected in the surface layer.
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline. 

Particle-size control section  - Clay content:  8 to l8 percent.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

C horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Other features:  Some pedons have strata of loamy sand below 100 cm.  Some pedons have a horizon of 5 to l5 percent carbonate concretions in the particle-size control section.  Some pedons lack gypsum crystals in the lower horizons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Garbutt, Penoyer Smaug and Toano soils.  

Garbutt soils have 20 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the sand and silt fractions and have segregated pedogenic carbonate in the particle-size control section.  Penoyer soils have soil temperatures of 12 to 15 degrees C. and appreciable precipitation during the summer months. Smaug and Toano soils average 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yipor soils occur on inset fans, fan skirts, and lake plain terraces and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with an admixture of loess.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,100 to 1,590 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is l00 to l20 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bubus and Needlepeak soils.  Bubus soils have fine sandy loam particle-size control sections.  Needlepeak soils are somewhat poorly drained and have 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or ponded runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, black greasewood, suaeda and mustard.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are of small extent. MLRA 24.
