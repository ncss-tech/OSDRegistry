YAQUICAN SERIES

The Yaquican series consists of shallow and very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from dacite tuff.  Yaquican soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 55 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yaquican gravelly sandy clay loam - recreation and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to strong very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    E--7 to 10 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine and common fine and medium irregular pores; noneffervescent; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    R--10 inches; hard, slightly fractured dacitic tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Coronado National Memorial; located at a latitude of 31 degrees, 21 minutes, 42 seconds North and longitude of 110 degrees, 16 minutes, 35 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F.

Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent

Reaction:  slightly acid or neutral

Clay content:  20 to 25 percent

Organic matter:  1 to 5 percent in the surface layer

Depth to unweathered bedrock:  10 to 20 inches

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry
Chroma:  1 through 3, dry or moist

E horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arbol (NM), Faraway (AZ), Oro Grande (NM), Seralin (NV), and Rotagilla (NM) series.
Arbol soils have a paralithic contact above the lithic contact. Faraway soils are neutral to moderately acid. Oro Grande soils are neutral to moderately alkaline. Seralin soils are derived from limestone and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and receive most of their precipitation in the winter. Rotagilla soils receive less than 16 inches of precipitation. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yaquican soils are on hills and mountains at elevation of 6700 to 7800 feet.  Slopes range from 55 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from dacitic tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is 23 to 25 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Morgamine soil.  Morgamine soils are moderately deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for recreation and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes silverleaf oak, Arizona white oak, cholla, beggartick threeawn, bull grass, and sideoats gramma.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Yaquican soils are of limited extent.  MLRA is 41.  The name is from nearby Yaqui Canyon.
