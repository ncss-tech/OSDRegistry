YELLOWBAY SERIES

The Yellowbay series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash or alluvium.  These soils are on outwash plains, dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, escarpments, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yellowbay very gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and grass; neutral (pH 6.6).  (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A--1 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine and medium pores; 35 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear irregular boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 23 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine and medium pores; 60 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual boundary. (15 to 25 inches)

    BC--23 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots in upper part of horizon, few below; common fine pores; 60 percent pebbles; 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6).

COMPETING SERIES:

Wagontown (ID) - have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches; have more than 35 percent medium and coarse sand.

Watony (WA) - have more than 35 percent medium and coarser sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - dissected alluvial fans, outwash plains, hills, escarpments and stream terraces.
Elevation - 2,300 to 4,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 30 percent.
Parent material - glacial outwash or alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs and falls; warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 25 inches, most of which falls as snow or as rain late in fall and early in spring. 
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 90 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability to a depth of 22 inches and rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yellowbay soils are used as woodland, for orchards, and as pastureland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine and Douglas fir in the overstory with an understory mainly of pinegrass, snowberry, mallow ninebark, and kinnikinnick.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Yellowbay soils are of small extent in the northwestern valleys and foothills of Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1979.  Yellowbay is a place name.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0553, MT7041.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 1 to 8 inches (A, part of Bw horizon); a cambic horizon from 4 to 23 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 11 to 41 inches (Bw, BC horizons).  Yellowbay soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
