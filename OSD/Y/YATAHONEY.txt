YATAHONEY SERIES

The Yatahoney series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Yatahoney soils are on tableland summits and in basins on fan terraces with slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Durixeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yatahoney silt loam -- on a northwest-facing slope of 3 percent, in native rangeland at 1,710 meters elevation.  (When described on July 18, 1979, the soil was dry to 23 cm and slightly moist below.   Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 8 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 18 cm thick)

    AB--8 to 23 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine, few fine tubular and vesicular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt1--23 to 56 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong very fine and fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.1); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 33 cm thick)

    Bt2--56 to 66 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong very fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; continuous prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 36 cm thick)

    Bkqm--66 to 97 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/4) continuous, indurated siliceous laminae over pale brown (10YR 6/3) continuous, indurated duripan; massive; brittle; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 46 cm thick)

    2R--97 cm; fractured basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Owyhee County, Idaho; about 12 1/2 miles west and 5 1/2 miles north of Riddle; 575 feet south and 80 feet east of the northwest corner of section 33, T. 13 S., R. 1 E.; USGS Shoofly Springs 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 15 minutes 24.3 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 21 minutes 14.7 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 42.2567500 latitude, -116.3540833 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Willho series.  The Willho soils lack bedrock above 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yatahoney soils occur on nearly level to sloping tableland summits and fan terraces at elevations of 5,200 to 6,150 feet.   Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 330 to 410 mm, and the average annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackleg, Boulder Lake, Deunah, Lostvalley, Nicholflat, Northcastle, Thacker, and Wickahoney soils.  Blackleg soils have a Mollic epipedon and more than 35 percent rock fragments in the texture control section.  Boulder Lake soils have deep wide cracks at some time of the year.  Deunah, Lostvalley, Nicholflat, and Thacker soils have an abrupt texture change.   Northcastle soils have a Mollic epipedon and less than 35 percent clay in the textural control section.  Wickahoney soils lack a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PSATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yatahoney soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is alkali sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and less commonly big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and northern Nevada.  Yatahoney soils are moderately extensive.
