YATES SERIES

The Yates series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, stony soils formed in residuum derived from Cambrian age limestone. These gently sloping to steep soils are on backslopes, shoulders and summits of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, thermic Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Yates very flaggy fine sandy loam--in rangeland.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very flaggy fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common roots; about 30 percent of the surface is covered with nearly flat-lying limestone flagstones, stones, and boulders 25 to 150 mm (1 to 6 in) thick and up to 1.2 m (4 ft) across the long axis; about 45 percent of the soil is limestone flagstones of same size as on surface and common fragments less than 76 mm (3 in) in diameter; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 36 cm [4 to 14 in])

     R--15 to 152 cm (6 to 60 in); indurated, coarsely fractured limestone bedrock, mostly 30 to 150 mm (1 to 6 in) thick and up to 3 m (10 ft) along the long axis, and common fragments less than 7.6 cm (3 in) in diameter.

TYPE LOCATION: McCulloch County, Texas; From the intersection U.S. Highway 87 and U.S. Highway 377 in Brady, 4.1 miles south on U.S. Highway 377, 7.5 miles southeast on Texas Highway 71, 2 miles east and 0.2 mile north on Long Valley Road, and 75 feet east in rangeland.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils include Eddy, Harmon, Loving, Maloterre, and Nebgen soils.
Eddy and Harmon soils: Are shallow to a paralithic contact.
Loving soils: Have less than 35 percent rock fragments and are shallow to a paralithic contact.
Maloterre soils: Have less than 35 percent rock fragments and carbonatic mineralogy.
Nebgen soils: Have less than 35 percent rock fragments and formed in parent material weathered from sandstone bedrock

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy residuum derived from Cambrian age limestone bedrock
Landscape: Dissected plateaus 
Landform: summits, shoulders and backslopes of ridges
Other features: The limestone typically is the hardest member of the associated calcareous rocks in the landscape.
Slopes: 1 to 40 percent, mainly less than 5 percent 
Slope shape: convex to plane
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly amount occurs during the fall and spring months. The winter and summer months are normally drier.
Mean annual precipitation: 660 to 762 mm (26 to 30 in)
Annual Thornthwaite P-E index: 30 to 52
Mean annual temperature: 17.8 to 19.4 degrees C (64 to 67 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 215 to 235 days
Elevation: 304.8 to 640.1 m (1,000 to 2,100 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cho, Mereta, Nebgen, and Tarrant soils.
Cho and Mereta soils: Have a mollic epipedon and occur on lower positions.
Nebgen soils: Are derived from sandstone and typically occur on lower positions.
Tarrant soils: Have mollic epipedons and occur on higher positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; Permeability is moderately rapid or moderate. Runoff is very low to low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, low to medium on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and medium to high on slopes greater than 20 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for rangeland. Vegetation is mainly short grasses. In some areas there are a few midgrasses, low growing shrubs, forbs, and a few scrubby trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-Central Texas; Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LLR-I: MLRA 81B-Edwards Plateau, Central Part; MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region, LRR-H: MLRA 78B-Central Rolling Red Plains, Western Part. This series is of moderate extent.
