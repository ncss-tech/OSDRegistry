YEATON SERIES

The Yeaton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation. These soils have been leveled for rice irrigation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Liberty County, Texas; 1986.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Bernard and Morey series. Classification was changed during the update of MLRA 150A. Soil moisture monitoring and field observations indicate these soils do not have aquic conditions for some time in normal years. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 33 to 83 cm (13 to 33 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in). (Ap and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 33 to 203 cm (13 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, Btk2, and Btkg horizons)
Calcic horizon of more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent: 84 to 203 cm (33 to 80 in). (Btk1, Btk2,and Btkg horizons)

Additional Comments:  Linear extensibility is greater than 6 between the mineral soil surface and 100 cm.
