YAMPA SERIES

The Yampa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, alluvium, and colluvium derived from limestone and sandstone.  Yampa soils are on mountains, alluvial fans, structural benches, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yampa very cobbly loam, on a northwest facing, convex, 10 percent slope in pinyon pine and Utah juniper at an elevation of 6,600 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on May 12, 1994 the soil was moist from 0 to 13 inches.

The surface is covered by 15 percent limestone or sandstone gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones.

    A--0 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; common fine irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; strongly effervescent; 19 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk1--7 to 13 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) extremely gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, many medium and coarse roots; few very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; many medium and coarse irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; violently effervescent; 33 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 45 to 57 inches thick)

    Bk2--13 to 31 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) very cobbly loam, pink (7.5YR 7/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; many medium and coarse irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; violently effervescent; 39 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0) gradual smooth boundary.

    Bk3--31 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; many fine and medium irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; violently effervescent; 24 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barkelew, Bronec, Tabyago, and Wildmount series.
Barkelew and Wildmount: have cambic horizons with less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and the top of the calcic horizon starts below 10 inches deep
Bronec:  has hue of 10YR or yellower
Tabyago: has a lithic contact with sandstone between 20 and 40 inches deep

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium, alluvium, and colluvium derived from limestone and sandstone
Landform:  mountains, structural benches, alluvial fans, and fan remnants
Slopes:  3 to 65 percent
