YOTES SERIES

The Yotes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite and welded tuff. Yotes soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Yotes gravelly ashy sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with approximately 15 percent gravel.

(48 to 53 cm thick) 

 Bqk2--104 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly ashy sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; hard, firm and brittle, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 50 percent durinodes; 18 percent gravel; many secondary calcium carbonate concretions around rock fragments and pendants on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; about 15 miles northwest of Atlanta; about 1,700 feet north and 2,200 feet west of the southeast corner of section 11, T. 9 N., R. 67 E.; USGS Indian Springs Knolls 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 39 minutes 08 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 25 minutes 34 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.6522222 latitude, -114.4252778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall and intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. 
Mollic epipedon thickness: 23 to 38 cm. 
Depth to base of cambic horizon: 43 to 64 cm. 
Depth to horizons with durinodes: 43 to 64 cm. 
Volcanic glass content: 40 to 60 percent in the 0.2 to 2.0 mm fraction.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 5 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 15 to 35 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 mm diameter) gravel. Lithology of fragments is volcanic rocks such as welded tuff and rhyolite.

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent in the material less than 2 mm.

Bk horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Gravelly ashy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.
Other features: This horizon has slightly higher clay content than the overlying horizon and is a cambic horizon. 

Bqk horizons
Value: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Gravelly ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy loam.
Durinodes: 30 to 50 percent.
Rupture resistance: Some pedons have a matrix which is firm and brittle when moist.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bitner, Brays, Chelan, Deskamp, Dryhollow, Emagert, Kester, Surprise, Weezweed, Winblow, Yellowhills, and Zark.

Bitner and Zark soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Brays, Deskamp, Kester, and Winblow soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Chelan soils are deep to dense compact till.
Dryhollow soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September and contain pumice gravel. Emagert soils have mollic epipedons greater than 60 cm thick. Surprise soils are noncalcareous throughout. Weezweed soils contain 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Yellowhills soils contain 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yotes soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite and welded tuff. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,135 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Plegomir and Zoda soils. Plegomir soils are loamy, very shallow and shallow to indurated duripans, and have ochric epipedons. Zoda soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to duripans, and have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Yotes soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native potential vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, and blue grama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County, Nevada, North Part 1993. 

REMARKS: The revision of March 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Aridic Duric Haploxerolls and recognized the presence of a cambic horizon. The revision of March 2006 updated the taxonomic class from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Duridic Haploxerolls and recognized the presence of volcanic ash weathered from the parent material.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A1 and A2 horizons). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 30 to 53 cm (Bk horizon). 
Duric feature - The zone from 53 to 152 cm (Bqk1 and Bqk2 horizons). 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bk horizon and parts of the A2 and Bqk1 horizons).
