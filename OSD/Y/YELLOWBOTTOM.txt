YELLOWBOTTOM SERIES

The Yellowbottom series consists of very deep, well-drained soils, with moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity, on uplands in the northern piedmont province. The soils formed in residuum of sericite schist, phyllonite, and metamonzagranite. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees f.

COMPETING SERIES: Buffstat, Casville, Clover, Danripple, Mount Rush (tentative), Spears Mountain, Totier, and Warminster soils in the same family and Diana Mills, Littlejoe, Lodi, Penhook, and Strawfield soils in closely related families. Buffstat soils are deep to paralithic contact.  Casville soils formed in residuum from felsic or intermediate igneous or metamorphic rock.  Clover soils formed in residuum from Triassic age materials. Danripple soils formed in old alluvium on stream terraces of the piedmont.  Diana Mills soils are deep to paralithic contact.  Littlejoe and Mount Rush (tentative) soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.  Lodi soils form in residuum from limestone.  Penhook soils have a redder subsoil.  Strawfield soils are moderately deep to lithic contact.  Warminster soils are deep to paralithic contact and formed in residuum of Triasic red shale.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Summits and backslopes on ridges and hills in the mesic Southern Piedmont. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Soils form in residuum from sericite schist, phyllonite, phyllite, and metamonzagranite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 45 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Buffstat, Littlejoe, Penhook, and Strawfield soils, these are the Bugley and Happyland soils.  Bugley soils are shallow to paralithic contact.  Happyland soils have less clay in the subsoil.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic
conductivity is moderately low to moderately high in the upper solum, low and moderately low in the lower solum. Runoff is low through very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for cropland, hay, pasture, and woodland.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Virginia. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Culpeper County, Virginia, 2006.

REMARKS: Yellowbottom soils were previously included in Buffstat map units. Variegation in C horizon may include neutral hues in some pedons. C horizons may have subhorizons of silty clay or clay in some pedons.  The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
1) Ochric epipedon - from the surface to 9 inches (O, Ap and E horizons) 
2) Argillic horizon - from 9 to 37 inches.
