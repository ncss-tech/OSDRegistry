YETULL SERIES

The Yetull series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium or eolian deposits or glacial lakeshore sediments.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, dunes, till plains, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Aridic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yetull loamy sand, in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 5 inches, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; single grain; soft, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 15 inches, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine and few medium roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    C2--15 to 35 inches, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    C3--35 to 66 inches, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common roots in upper part and few below 50 inches; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:

Dearjosh (CO) - Precipitation is distrubuted evenly throughout the year.

Marthaspeak (CO) - Moderately deep to a lithic contact.

Trey (SD) - Moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

Tusler (ND) - has a paralithic contact of sandstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

Zeona (SD) - greater than 36 inches to carbonates; has less than 35 percent medium and coarse sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans; stream terraces; hills; dunes; till plains; escarpments.

Elevation - 1,900 to 6,500 feet.

Slope - 0 to 70 percent.

Parent material - sand, alluvium, eolian deposits or glacial lakeshore sediments.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 15 inches, most of which falls in the spring and in the early part of summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 70 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Busby, Chinook, Fleak and Twilight soils.  Busby, Chinook and Twilight soils are below Yetull soils on the landscape.  They are coarse-loamy.  In addition, Busby and Twilight and have a calcic horizon, Twilight soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and Chinook soils have a mollic epipedon.  Fleak soils occur on similar landscape positions as Yetull.  They are shallow to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yetull soils are used mainly for range.  The potential native vegetation is mainly prairie sandreed, little bluestem, Indian ricegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, sand bluestem, forbs and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Yetull soils are of moderate extent east of the mountains in Montana.  These are also in the states of Colorado, North Dakota and Wyoming.
