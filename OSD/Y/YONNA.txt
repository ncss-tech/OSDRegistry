YONNA SERIES

The Yonna series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with layers of volcanic ash and pumice.  Yonna soils are on flood plains and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Yonna soils are on narrow aggrading flood plains and low terraces.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,400 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sediments weathered mainly from diatomite, tuff and basalt, over alluvium derived from ash and mixed sediments, over alluvium derived from mixed sediments.  The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dilman, Klamath, and Ontko soils.  Dilman, Klamath and Ontko soils are on a lower flood plain position than Yonna soils, are poorly or very poorly drained and have a mollic epipedon. Dilman soils have depths to the lower, loamy material of greater than 40 inches.  Klamath soils are fine-silty.  Ontko soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately slow permeability. The soil is saturated throughout in March.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 0 to 40 inches from February to June, at a depth of 40 to 120 inches in July and August and November to January, and over 120 inches in September and October.  This soil is subject to occasional periods of brief flooding from March to May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for irrigated pasture, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation on noncultivated areas is mainly silver sagebrush, green rabbitbrush, inland saltgrass, basin wildrye, and Nevada bluegrass.  In areas with altered hydrology, the saline conditions and salt-tolerant vegetation is lacking.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Stream valleys near the southern fringe of the pumice-mantled region in south-central Oregon; MLRA 21. The soils are inextensive.
