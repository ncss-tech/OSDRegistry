MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: City of Virginia Beach, Virginia; 1982.

REMARKS: 
In the past, Yeopim soils have been included with Dogue and Altavista soils.  However, Dogue soils are in a clayey family and Altavista soils are in a fine-loamy family.  Particle size data is available for this pedon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (the Ap horizon)

Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 8 inches to a depth of 42 inches  (the Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)

MLRA(s): 153A, 153B, 133A
