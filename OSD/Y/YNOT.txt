YNOT SERIES

The Ynot series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or eolian material.  Ynot soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ynot sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--6 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8) clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2--13 to 18 inches; light yellow brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 10 to 21 inches.)

    C--18 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) sandy loam; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and common fine pores; neutral (pH 7.2).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fallon County, Montana, 1991.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1269.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from 0 to 13inches (A, Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 13 to 18 inches (Bw2 horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2, C horizons).  Ynot soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
