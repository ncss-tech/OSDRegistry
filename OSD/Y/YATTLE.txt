YATTLE SERIES

The Yattle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from red sandstone.  Yattle soils are on fans and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yattle fine sandy loam, on a southeast facing, 5 percent slope in grass at an elevation of 4,550 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 13, 1984 the soil was moist from 0 to 33 inches.

(7 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk2--43 to 70 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium irregular soft carbonate masses; 5 percent pebbles; violently effervescent, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County Area soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (part of the Bw1, Bw2, and part of the Bk1 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 33 inches.  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 33 to 43 inches.  (Bk1 horizon)
Other features:  Ustic aridic moisture regime

Remarks:  Calcium carbonate equivalent was obtained from field measurements. This soil was originally considered to be in the Yarts series.  Changes in soil taxonomy and the identification of consistent visible calcium carbonate in the control section resulted in a change to Ustic Haplocalcids.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
