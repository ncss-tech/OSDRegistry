YAMACALL SERIES

The Yamacall series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, escarpments, drainageways, sedimentary plains, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yamacall loam, in grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

Soil temperature - 5.6 to 8.3 degrees C (42 to 47 degrees F).  Range mean annual soil temperature to 3.3 degrees C (38 degrees F) in MLRA 44.
Moisture control section - between 10 and 30 centimeters (4 and 12 inches), dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 centimeters (about 20 inches) is 5 degrees C (41 degrees F) or higher.
Depth to Bk horizon - 25 to 50 centimeters (about 10 to 20 inches).
Depth to carbonates - 0 to 50 centimeters (about 0 to 20 inches).
Percent rock fragments - 0 to 5.
A BC horizon is present in some profiles.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y
Value:  5 or 6 dry; 3, 4, or 5 moist
Chroma:  2, 3, or 4
Texture:  loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam
Clay content:  18 to 35 percent

Clay content:  18 to 35 percent with 15 to 35 percent fine sand and coarser
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent--0 to 5 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent pebbles
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 15 percent
Effervescence:  none to strongly
Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 8.4

Bk horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - alluvial fans; fan remnants; stream terraces; escarpments; sedimentary plains; hills; ridges.

Frost-free season - 80 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Delpoint soils and the Busby, Cabbart, Cambeth, and Havre soils.  Busby soils occur on similar landscapes as Yamacall soils.  They are coarse-loamy.  Havre soils occur on floodplains below the Yamacall soils.  Delpoint and Cambeth soils occur on sideslopes above Yamacall soils.  They have soft bedrock at 50 to 100 centimeters (about 20 to 40 inches).  Cabbart soil occur on summits and shoulders of ridges.  They have soft bedrock at 25 to 50 centimeters (about 10 to 20 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Yamacall soils are used for nonirrigated and irrigated crops and for range.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, little bluestem, forbs and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Yamacall soils are of moderate extent in the eastern part of Montana and possibly in adjacent states.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hill County, Montana, 1994.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0138.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 18 centimeters, 7 inches (Ap, Bw horizons); cambic horizon - from 10 to 28 centimeters, 4 to 11 inches (Bw horizon); accumulation of lime - from 28 to 152 centimeters, 11 to 60 inches (Bk horizons).  Yamacall soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

The soil was previously called Yamac.
