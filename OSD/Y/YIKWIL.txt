SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yakama Nation, Yakima County, Washington; 2014

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 3 to 28 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 28 to 86 cm
*Argillic horizon--zone from 86 to 160 cm
*Andic soil properties--zone from 3 to 86 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 3 to 103 cm

Values for andic soil properties, including glass content, acid oxalate aluminum and iron, and 15-bar water retention, were estimated based on laboratory data from similar soils.

Yikw'il is the Yakama word for muddy. The type location for this series is in the vicinity of Swamp Creek. In 2004, the series originally was named the Pulu series.
