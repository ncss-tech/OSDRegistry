YELM SERIES

The Yelm series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial outwash. They are in relict glacial lacustrine lakes and drainageways on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,150 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Elwha and Roche series. The Elwha soils have a densic horizon between 50 and 100 cm and are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following.  Roche soils have a densic horizon between 50 and 100 cm and are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 days following.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Yelm soils are on glacial outwash terraces at elevations of 10 to 100 meters. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in sandy glacial outwash. Yelm soils are in a marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1,067 to 1,219 mm. Mean January temperature is 2 degrees C; mean July temperature is 24 degrees C. Mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C. The frost-free season is 170 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Steilacoom, Everett, and McChord series. The Everett and McChord series are on convex glacial features such as kames, eskers, and till plains. Everett soils are sandy-skeletal. and McChord soils are loamy-skeletal. Steilacoom soils are in concave areas of relict glacial lakes and drainageways and are coarse-silty.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; slow to medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consisted of Douglas-fir, red alder, western redcedar and bigleaf maple with an understory of salal, Oregon-grape, trailing blackberry, red huckleberry, western brackenfern, western swordfern, salmonberry and vine maple. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Washington; MLRA 2. The series is of small extent.
