YOMONT SERIES 

The Yomont series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvial sediments of Permian age redbeds. These soils are on nearly level flood plains of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and Mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Ustifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Yomont very fine sandy loam--cultivated.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

     Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. Thickness is 18 to 46 cm (7 to 18 in)

     C--23 to 203 cm (9 to 80 in); light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; bedding planes evident; thin strata of silt loam and loamy very fine sand with few silty clay loam strata less than 1/2 inch thick; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Stonewall County, Texas; about 14 miles east of Aspermont, Texas; in cultivated field, from the intersection of U. S. Highways 83 and 380 in Aspermont, about 10 miles east on U. S. Highway 380 to the intersection with State Highway 283, then about 4.6 miles southeast on State Highway 283 to the bridge over Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River, then about 0.2 mile south and east from the bridge, then about 800 feet north.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in the same family.  Closely similar soils include the Clairemont, Colorado, Lincoln, Westola, and Wheatwood series.  
Clairemont and Wheatwood soils: have fine-silty particle-size control sections 
Colorado soils: have fine-loamy particle-size control sections  
Lincoln soils: have sandy particle-size control sections  
Westola soils: have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:    
Parent material: calcareous, stratified, silty and loamy alluvium derived from Permian age silty and sandy redbeds
Landscape: dissected plains
Landform: flood plains of streams
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 533 to 762 mm (21 to 30 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 31 to 44
Mean annual air temperature: 13.9 to 17.8 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 190 to 230 days
Elevation: 228.6 to 762.0 m (750 to 2500 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clairemont, Colorado, Deepwood, Enterprise, Lincoln, and Westola soils 
Clairemont, Colorado, Lincoln, and Westola soils: occur on similar positions
Deepwood and Enterprise soils: have cambic horizons and occur on higher colluvial and eolian mantles 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is negligible. These soils are frequently or occasionally flooded for very brief or brief duration.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major use is cropland with cotton and grain sorghum as the main crops.  Some areas are used for native range. Native vegetation includes short and mid grasses.  A moderate amount of mesquite occurs in some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C) of Texas and Oklahoma.  The soil is of moderate extent.
