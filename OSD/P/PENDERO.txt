PENDERO SERIES

The Pendero series consists of very deep, excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils formed in eolian sands.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on sand sheets on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pendero fine sand -- rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Btk2--45 to 66 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) crushed, loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) crushed, moist; 8 percent clay; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; 30 percent distinct clay bridging between sand grains and 35 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 1 percent fine threadlike carbonate masses; 2 percent nonflat angular 0.1- to 0.4-inch fragments; slightly effervescent, by HCl, 1 normal;  moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Btk horizons is 30 to 48 inches)

    Bk--66 to 80 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) crushed, loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) crushed, moist; 8 percent clay;  massive;  nonsticky, nonplastic; 1 percent fine threadlike carbonate masses; 2 percent nonflat angular 0.1- to 0.4-inch  fragments; slightly effervescent, by HCl, 1 normal; moderately  alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Otero County, New Mexico; approximately 3.1 miles north and 3.7 miles east of Oro Grande; 2,150 feet east and 1,950 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 4,  T.  22 S. , R. 9 E.  UTM zone 13, 403425E, 3587477N; NAD 27; USGS Oro Grande North topographic quadrangle; latitude 32 degrees 25 minutes 18.85 seconds north  and longitude 106 degrees 01 minutes 37.59 seconds west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts more than three-fourths of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing soils.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian sands
Landform: sand sheet on basin floors
Slope: 2 to 5 percent
Mean annual temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 200 to 240 days
Elevation: 3,900 to 4,200 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Copia, Elizario, Foxtrot, Hueco, Mcnew, and Nations soils.
Copia soils do not have argillic horizons and are on sand sheets on the basin floor.
Elizario soils have calcic horizons and are on slightly depressed alluvial flats of the basin floor.
Foxtrot, Hueco, and Nations soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on the basin floor.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:   Excessively drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is very low .

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is of the desert shrub type consisting of mesa dropseed, spike dropseed, sand dropseed, threeawns, sand sage, broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush, and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Trans-Pecos of Texas and southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42; small extent.
