(14 to 20 inches thick)

    R--27 inches; bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lower Kenai Peninsula Area, Alaska; about 1 mile southwest of Port Graham, 500 feet north and 1400 feet east of the SW corner of section 32, T. 9S., R. 15W., Seward Meridian; USGS Seldovia B-5 quadrangle; lat. 59 degrees 15 minutes 55 seconds N. and long. 151 degrees 50 minutes 56 seconds W.

O horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 2 to 4
Reaction class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

E and Eb horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: extremely acid or strongly acid

Bs and Bsb horizons:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Diobsud and Seldovia series. Diobsud soils lack bedrock. Seldovia soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: silty volcanic ash over glacial till and/or colluvium over bedrock
Landform: mountain slopes
Slopes: range from 15 to 35 percent
Elevations: 20 to 1000 feet.
Climate: is maritime with mild winters and cool summers
Mean January temperature: is about 25 degrees F.
Mean July temperature is 54 degrees F.
Mean annual temperature: 36 to 39 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 70 to 120 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Jakolof, Koyuktolik, Kasitsna, Nanwalek, and Tutka soils. Jakolof soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock and are on stream terraces. Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic matter accumulated in depressions. Kasitsna and Seldovia soils occur on moraines and slopes with thick deposits of glacial till and colluvium. Nanwalek soils are on metastable mountainslopes with thick colluvial deposits. Tutka soils have bedrock within 20 inches and occur on glacially abraded bedrock ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, subsistence, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is Sitka spruce, devils club, alder, salmonberry, fern, and moss.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 223 Cook Inlet Mountains, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
