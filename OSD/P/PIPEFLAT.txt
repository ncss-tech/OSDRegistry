PIPEFLAT SERIES

The Pipeflat series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand over alluvium derived from granite. The Pipeflat soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Arenic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Pipeflat sand on a north-facing, smooth, 1 percent slope at an elevation of 2300 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by approximately 10 percent gravel.

    2Btk2--34 to 46 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to strong coarse subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots between peds; many very fine tubular pores; few faint brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay bridging between sand grains; 3 percent very fine very pale brown (10YR 8/2) soft carbonate threads; 8 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the 2Btk horizons is 12 to 22 inches.)

    2C--46 to 59 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 8 percent gravel; strongly effervescent matrix; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.1) clear wavy boundary.

    2Ck--59 to 66 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 2 percent coarse irregular very pale brown (10YR 8/2) soft masses of calcium carbonate; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Maljamar (NM) and Olympus (CA) series. Maljamar and Olympus soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pipeflat soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in eolian sands over alluvium derived from granite. Elevations are 1,900 to 2,800 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 64 to 69 degrees F., and the frost free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluepoint and Cajon soils. Bluepoint and Cajon soils have sandy particle-size control sections and do not have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; negligible to low runoff; moderately rapid over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Pipeflat soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly big galleta, Indian ricegrass and creosotebush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
