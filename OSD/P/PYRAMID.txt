USE AND VEGETATION:  
On slopes of less than 45 percent the soils are used as rangeland.  The native vegetation is tall grass, dominantly bluejoint reedgrass, and associated plants including fireweed, salmonberry, and alder.  A few patches of white spruce, Sitka spruce, and paper birch occur in places.
