PALON SERIES

The Palon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from rhyolite.  Palon soils are on mountain slopes and summits.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Palon very cobbly sandy loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; leaves, needles, twigs, and bark.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    A1--5 to 10 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) very cobbly sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots and common medium roots; 10 percent stones, 30 percent cobbles, and 5 percent pebbles; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 18 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 25 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots and common medium roots; 20 percent stones, 40 percent cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

    E--25 to 81 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many medium, common fine, and few coarse roots; 25 percent stones, 40 percent cobbles, and 5 percent pebbles; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (25 to 60 cm thick)

    E/Bt1--81 to 134 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly  sticky and nonplastic; lamellae are 0.5 to 3 cm thick; total thickness of lamellae is 15 cm or more in this horizon; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; clay bridging sand grains;) few fine and medium roots; 2  percent stones, 30 percent cobbles, and 5 percent pebbles; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 65 cm thick)

    E/Bt2--134 to 170 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; lamellae are 0.5 to 3 cm thick, total thickness of the lamellae is 15 cm or more in this horizon; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; clay bridging sand grains;) few fine roots; 15 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent pebbles; neutral.
