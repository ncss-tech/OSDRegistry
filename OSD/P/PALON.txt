PALON SERIES

The Palon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from rhyolite.  Palon soils are on mountain slopes and summits.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Palon very cobbly sandy loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(7 to 26 inches thick)

    E/Bt2--51 to 65 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (7.5Y  5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; (lamellae are 1/4 to 1 inch thick, total thickness of the lamellae is 6 inches or more in this horizon; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; clay bridging sand grains;) few fine roots; 15 percent stones, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent pebbles; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sandoval County, New Mexico; Baca Location No. 1. South side of Cerro Seco.  New Mexico state plane coordinates N. 1,798,000 feet and E. 405,392 feet; 106 degrees, 34 minutes, 16 seconds west longitude;  35 degrees, 56 minutes, 44 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Usually moist in at least some part of the moisture control section December through April and moist in some part of the moisture control section July through October.  The soil is driest during May and June.

Soil Temperature: 43 to 47 degrees F.

Reaction:  The profile is generally neutral to slightly acid but E and Bt may range to medium acid.

A horizon - Value:  4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist. Chroma:  1 through 3. Texture:  cobbly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam with 15 to 70 percent rock fragments.

E horizon - Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR. Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist. Chroma:  2 through 6. Texture:  very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.

E/Bt horizon:

E horizon part - Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR. Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist. Chroma:  1 through 4. Texture:  very cobbly sandy loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam, very gravelly loamy sand with 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments.

Bt horizon part - Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR. Value:  4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist. Chroma:  2 through 6. Texture:  very cobbly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy clay loam, extremely cobbly sandy loam and extremely cobbly sandy clay loam with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments

The argillic horizon is based on lamellae 1 cm thick with a combined thickness of over 15 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Marquette(MN) and Pelan(NM) series in the same family and the closely related Origo(NM).  Marquette and Pelan soils are calcareous in some horizon above 40 inches.  Origo soils have cryic temperatures.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Palon soils are on mountain sides slopes and summits. Slopes range from 15 to 80 percent.  Elevations are 7,200 to 10,000 feet.  The soils formed in material weather from rhyolite.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 to 46 degrees F. and the frost-free season is about 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Origo soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for woodland.  Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, quaking aspen, and mountain brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral mountains of New Mexico.  The series is inextensive.
