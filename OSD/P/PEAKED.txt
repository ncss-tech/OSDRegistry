PEAKED SERIES

The Peaked series consists of very deep, moderately-well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Peaked soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1525 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peaked soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex summit, shoulder, and backslope positions on ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 0 to 1100 meters. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1270 to 2030 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dolason, Forhaux, and Oceanhouse, soils. Dolason soils lack redoximorphic features. Forhaux soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on convex summit and shoulder positions. Oceanhouse soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, have redoximorphic features between 0 to 10 centimeters, and are on concave backslope positions.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately-well drained; high to very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation is annual and perennial grasses and forbs including wild oat, slender oat, bristly dogstail grass, plantain, manroot, buttercup. Some sites have scattered coyotebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
