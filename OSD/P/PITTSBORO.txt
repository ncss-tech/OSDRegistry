SERIES ESTABLISHED: Chatham County, North Carolina; 2005

REMARKS: This series was formerly included with Zion, Orange, and Wynott soils. Zion soils are well drained and have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Orange soils have redoximorphic features in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Wynott soils are well drained.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone between depths of 16 and 38 inches (Btss, BCt, and Ct horizons)
Paralithic contact--the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 38 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)
Lithic contact--the occurance of unweathered bedrock at a depth of 43 inches (upper boundary of the R horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data will be available from the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon number S98NC-037-00?
