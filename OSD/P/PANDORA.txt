PANDORA SERIES

The Pandora series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in moderately fine textured till. These soils are on nearly level to slightly depressional till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Typic Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Pandora silt loam, on a nearly level area in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) rubbed, silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium and coarse granular structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bg--18 to 28 cm (7 to 11 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 18 cm (7 inches) thick]

 Btg1--28 to 58 cm (11 to 23 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky; firm; faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) coatings and common faint clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct brown (10YR 4/3) and common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; few rock fragments; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 Btg2--58 to 96 cm (23 to 38 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure; firm; faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) coatings and common faint clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and distinct brown (10YR 4/3) masses of iron accumulation; about 2 percent rock fragments; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 51 to 89 cm (20 to 35 inches).]

 BC--96 to 140 cm (38 to 55 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; common faint gray (10YR 5/1) coatings on faces of peds; many medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions and common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; about 5 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent in lower part; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. [25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick]

 C--140 to 152 cm (55 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; massive; firm; common medium faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation and distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; about 5 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Seneca County, Ohio; about 6 miles southwest of Tiffin, in Hopewell Township; 2000 feet north of Township Road 98 and 750 feet east of County Road 591; sec. 33, T. 2 N., R. 14 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum: typically 127 to 152 cm (50 to 60 inches) and ranges from 102 to 178 cm (40 to 70 inches)
Depth to carbonates: typically are in the lower part of the solum and at depths of less than 178 cm (70 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 35 to 40 percent clay, with some subhorizons ranging as high as 45 percent
Rock fragments: mainly shale and limestone with smaller amounts of sandstone and crystalline rocks
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent throughout; commonly gravel or stones, but boulders may be present

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 (3 or 4 uncrushed and 6 dry)
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

A horizon, where present:
Thickness: 5 to 13 cm (2 to 5 inches)
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

Btg horizon:
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, or is neutral
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 0 to 2; some pedons have Bt horizons 13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 inches) thick below a depth of 76 cm (30 inches) that have chroma of 3 to 6
Texture: silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: silty clay loam or clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 20 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Series in closely related families are the Condit, Latty, and Wetzel soils. Condit soils have illitic mineralogy and are typically more acid than slightly acid in the solum. Latty and Wetzel soils have illitic mineralogy and average more than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section. In addition, Latty soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pandora soils are in slight depressions on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in moderately fine textured till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 965 mm (32 to 38 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Blount, Glynwood, and Pewamo soils on till plains, and the Digby, Haney, Haskins, and Shoals soils. The somewhat poorly drained Blount soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. Glynwood soils are moderately well drained and on higher landscape positions. Pewamo soils are on similar landscape positions but have mollic epipedons. Digby, Haney, and Haskins soils are on nearby terraces and outwash plains. Shoals soils are on nearby flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. These soils have frequent, brief surface ponding in late winter or early spring. An apparent seasonal high water table is at or within 30 cm (1 foot) of the surface during part of the same period. The potential for surface runoff in negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay. A few areas are in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is forest of soft maple, elm, ash, swamp, white oak, and basswood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and western Ohio and possibly Indiana; MLRA 111B. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Putnam County, Ohio, 1930.

REMARKS: Classification was adjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 22 Sept 94 by CLG. The Pandora series was inactivated in 1966. It was reactivated for use in Seneca County, Ohio, in January 1978, and the classification was changed from Mollic Haplaquepts to Typic Ochraqualfs. Pandora soils in modern surveys had been previously mapped with the Wetzel series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 96 cm (Btg horizons).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 18 cm.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for one site in Seneca County (SA-33).
