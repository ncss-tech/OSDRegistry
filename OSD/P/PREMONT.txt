PREMONT SERIES

The Premont series consists of very deep, moderately permeable, well drained soils that have formed in loamy sediments over calcareous loamy alluvium of Quaternary age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on crests on paleoterraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kleberg County, Texas; 2007.

REMARKS:  The Premont soils were formerly included in the Delfina series.  Future study is needed to verify the calcic horizon of these soils.  The calcium carbonate masses appear to be degrading petrocalcic fragments and are being removed from the soil matrix.  This is characterized by the sharp boundaries of the soft material surrounding, in some cases, nodules that vary in size.  These are mostly in the lower materials below the lithologic discontinuity.
Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: 21 to 71 cm (8 to 28 in). (Bt horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 21 cm (0 to 8 in).
Argillic horizon: 21 to 153 cm (8 to 60 in). (Bt and 2Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon: 95 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in). (2Btk horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: 95 to 203 cm (37 to 80 in.) (2Btk horizons) Data shows the lithologic discontinuity is weakly expressed.  Very fine to fine sand ration shows a significant decrease at 95 cm.  The presence of coarse, spherical, moderately cemented, nodules indicate a deposition of alluvium with a different lithology than the recent alluvium in the upper part of the solum.
