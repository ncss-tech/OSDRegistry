POPCORN SERIES

The Popcorn series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from limestone. Popcorn soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 10 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic Aridic Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Popcorn very gravelly clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3), moist; 32 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky parting to moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine and common medium pores; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles comprised of limestone; violently effervescent, 44 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 8 inches thick)

    AC--3 to 13 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2), moist; 34 percent clay; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and common medium roots; common very fine and fine and few medium pores; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles comprised of limestone; violently effervescent, 44 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 16 inches thick)

    R--13 to 60 inches; limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Popcorn soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from limestone and occur on hills and mountains. Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet. Slope ranges from 10 to 50 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 160 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Oversight and Yarbam soils.
Oversight soils occur on lower foot slopes and alluvial fans and are very deep. Yarbam soils occur on similar positions and have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate or moderately slow permeability; medium or high runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is one-seed juniper, pinyon, turbinella oak, Emory oak, manzanita, mountain mahogany, catclaw, agave, beargrass, sideoats grama, hairy grama, three-awn, and bullgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Arizona.  The Popcorn series is of small extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 38.
