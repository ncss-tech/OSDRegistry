PULCAN SERIES

Pulcan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from mudstone.  Pulcan soils are on terrace side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Pulcan soils are on side slopes of old terraces, at elevations of 1,680 to 1,985 meters. Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tertiary mudstone, sandstone, and interbedded tuff.  The summers are hot and dry and the winters are cold and wet.  Precipitation is mostly snow in winter months and rain during spring months.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 95 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Indian Creek, Puett, and Uhaldi soils. Indian Creek soils have a duripan within 50 cm.  Puett soils lack an argillic horizon and are shallow over tertiary sediments. Uhaldi soils have a gravelly clay loam argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:   Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:   Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally low sagebrush, littleleaf horsebrush, Thurbers needlegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:   Western Nevada.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 26.
