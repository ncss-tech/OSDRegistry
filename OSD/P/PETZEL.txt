PETZEL SERIES

The Petzel series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in outwash with loess influence.  Petzel soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Petzel silt loam on a fan remnant with 7 percent slope at an elevation of 1920 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A1 --- 0 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent granitic gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.

	A2 --- 15 to 56 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and roots; common very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent granite gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 20 to 56 cm)

	Bt --- 56 to 75 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent granitic gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt irregular boundary. (19 to 45 cm thick)

	2Bk --- 75 to 120 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly loam; pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores;  60 percent carbonate coats on rock fragments; 40 percent masses of calcium carbonate in matrix; 20 percent granitic gravel; 43 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 2 percent krotovinas; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (45 to 65 cm thick)

	2Btk --- 120 to 152 cm; 60 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and 40 percent white  (10YR 8/1) gravelly loam; 60 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist and 40 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak thick platy; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; prominent clay films on all faces of peds; 20 percent granitic gravel and 5 percent granitic cobbles; 48 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

COMPETING SERIES:
These are the Akbash, Burchert, Clegg, Despain, Gross, Jensen, and Lize series.  Akbash soils are deep to bedrock.  Burchert and Gross soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Clegg soils have no discontinuity and have 0 to 25 percent fragments in the calcic horizon.  Despain and Lize soils have 20 to 35 percent fragments in the argillic horizon.  Jensen soils have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 6.7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: outwash plain
Landform: fan remnant
Elevation: 1882 to 1981 meters
Slope: 0 to 8 percent
