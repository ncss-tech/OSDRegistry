PAGESPRINGS SERIES

The Pagesprings series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum on limestone hills and mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Pagesprings very gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 60 percent or more surface cover of cryptogams.

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy parting to weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobble; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary (1 to 3 inches thick).

    Bk--2 to 7 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very cobbly silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through medium roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; 20 percent cobble and 20 percent gravel; many thick coats and pendants of calcium carbonate on undersides of rock fragments; weakly cemented with calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary (4 to 8 inches thick).

    R--7 inches; white (10YR 8/1) limestone.

TYPE LOCATION: Yavapai County, Arizona; approximately 2 miles west of Cornville; 200 feet west and 100 feet north of the southeastern corner of section 7; T.15 N., R.4 E; 111 degrees, 57 minutes, 25 seconds west longitude and 34 degrees, 42 minutes, 22 seconds north latitude.

Soil Temperature: 62 to 65 degrees F.

Rock fragments: 40 to 75 percent gravel and cobble

Clay content: 15 to 25 percent

Value: 3 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist

Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist
Organic matter: 0.1 to 0.5 percent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Bissett (TX) and Lozier (TX) series. Bissett soils have 25 to 35 percent clay.  Lozier soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pagesprings soils are on hills and mesas at elevations of 3,500 to 4,500 feet.  They formed in residuum from limestone of the Verde Formation.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days and occur on the Edwards Plateau.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gyberg and Bilgray soils.   Gyberg soils are very deep and have argillic horizons.  Bilgray soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and urban land.  Vegetation consists of creosotebush, ratany, snakeweed, mimosa, and canotia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Arizona.  Pagesprings soils are of small extent.  MLRA is 38.  Named after the nearby town of Pagesprings.
