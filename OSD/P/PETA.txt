PETA SERIES

The Peta series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial flats.

Elevation - 2,000 to 3,000 feet.

Slope - 0 to 3 percent.

Parent material - alluvium.

Climate - cool, with long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 

Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 16 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amor, Lehr, Parshall, Reeder, Regent, Tally and Wabek soils.  Amor and Reeder soils are on side slopes of uplands.  Regent soils are on upland plains.  Amor, Reeder and Regent soils have soft bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Lehr and Wabek soils are on outwash plains and dissected terraces.  They have gravel within 20 inches of the surface.  Parshall and Tally soils are on similar landscapes, but have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.    

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Moderate permeability.  The soil has a seasonal high water table at depths of 2 to 4 feet at some time during the period of April through June.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used as cropland.  Some areas are used for range.  The potential native plant community is mainly big bluestem, switchgrass, western wheatgrass, and green needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern North Dakota. Peta soils are of small extent.
