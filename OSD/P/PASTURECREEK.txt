PASTURECREEK SERIES

The Pasturecreek series consists of deep and very deep, well-drained soils on backslopes of mountains. Pasturecreek soils formed in mixed volcanic ash, loess and colluvium overlying colluvium from argillite, metavolcanic rocks or rhyolite. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature about 38 degrees F.
