PADONIA SERIES

The Padonia series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over clayey residuum weathered from calcareous shales. Padonia soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Padonia silty clay loam - on a 6 percent slope in native pasture.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, hard; sticky and plastic; common fine roots throughout; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

  A2--15 to 28 centimeters (6 to 11 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay loam; brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm, very hard; sticky and plastic; common fine roots throughout; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined A horizons are 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) thick.)

  Bt--28 to 56 centimeters (11 to 22 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay; brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very firm, very hard; very sticky and very plastic; few faint continuous clay films; few fine roots throughout; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) thick)

  Btk--56 to 81 centimeters (22 to 32 inches); 70% dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), and 30% olive gray (5Y 4/2) silty clay; 70% yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), and 30% olive gray (5Y 5/2) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very firm, very hard; very sticky and very plastic; few faint continuous clay films; few fine roots throughout; few fine rounded carbonate nodules; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches) thick)

  BCk--81 to 94 centimeters (32 to 37 inches); olive gray (5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm, hard; sticky and plastic; few fine roots throughout; strongly effervescent; few fine rounded carbonate nodules; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) thick)

  Cr--94 centimeters (37 inches); light olive gray (5Y 6/2) dry; partially weathered calcareous shale.

TYPE LOCATION: Brown County, Kansas; about 5 miles west and 4 miles north of Morrill; 381 meters (1250 feet) east and 121 meters (400 feet) north of the southwest corner of section 6 T. 1S, R. 15E

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section; Udic moisture regime.
Depth to paralithic contact: 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to calcareous shale
Depth to argillic horizon: 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches)
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 30 to 61 centimeters (12 to 24 inches)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches)
Carbonate concretions: depths less than 71 centimeters (28 inches).
Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 35 to 50 percent

Carbonates are in the form of concretions, films, or threads. 

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry
Chroma: 1 to 3

Btk horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y
Value: 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry
Chroma: 2 to 6
Texture: Silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam
Clay content: 35 to 50 percent
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

BCk horizon if present:
Hue: 2.5Y or 5Y
Value: 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry
Chroma: 2 to 4 moist or dry
Texture: Silty clay loam
Clay content: 27 to 40 percent
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline
The wide range of color is considered to be inherent of the varicolored
shale.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Romona and Wamego soil.
Romona and Wamego soils do not have carbonates in the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Loess over clayey residumm weathered from calcareous shales.
Landform: Uplands
Slopes: 3 to 25 percent
Mean annual temperature: 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 55 degrees F)

Frost-free period: 165 to 185 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Martin, Mayberry, Morrill, Oska, Pawnee, Shelby, and Sogn soils.
Mayberry, Morrill, Pawnee, and Shelby soils are deep and occur on higher landscape positions.
Oska soils are moderately deep.
Sogn soils are shallow.
Oska and Sogn soils are on lower landscape positions.
