PICKRELL SERIES

The Pickrell series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and material weathered from sandstone.  Pickrell soils are on mesas and benches and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Lithic Haplocalcids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Loamy fine sand, rangeland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grained; loose; few fine roots; moderately calcareous, lime disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (O to 3 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 5 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine end very fine pores; moderately calcareous, lime disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 12 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and common fine roots; few fine pores; moderately calcareous, lime disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 18 inches; pink (5YR 7/4) gravelly loamy fine sand, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine pores; 30 percent lime nodules; strongly calcareous, with nodular, weakly to strongly cemented lime; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick)

    R--18 inches; sandstone

TYPE LOCATION: San Juan County, Utah; one mile north and 3 miles west of Oljeto Trading Post; SW1/4 SW1/4 section 35, T.42S., R.14E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Depth to bedrock: 12 to 20 inches

Mean annual soil temperature: 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.

Soil moisture: The soils are dry in all parts above the base of the moisture control section for 75 to 85 percent of the time. Typic aridic moisture regime.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pickrell soils are on mesas and benches at elevations of 4,800 to 5,500 feet.  Slope gradients are 1 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in eolian deposits and residuum from sandstone.  The climate is arid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 degrees to 56 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 72 degrees to 77 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nepalto and Neskahi soils.  Nepalto and Neskahi soils lack a lithic contact within 60 inches of the surface and lack calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability above the bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used as rangeland.  Vegetation is blackbrush, galleta grass, Indian ricegrass, Mormon tea, and a few scattered juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Utah.  Pickrell soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 35.
