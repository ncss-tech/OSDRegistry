PAGINA SERIES

The Pagina series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian sands and alluvium from sandstone on rolling plateaus and low hills on structural benches. Slopes are 0 to 16 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Pagina fine sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

       A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grain; loose; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

       Bk1--2 to 13 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent lime coated gravel with thicker coatings on the bottom than on the top; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 11 inches thick)

       Bk2--13 to 22 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent lime coated gravel with thicker coatings on the bottom than on the top; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick)

       Bk3--22 to 38 inches; pinkish white (5YR 8/2) sandy loam, pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent lime coated gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 21 inches thick)

       2Cr--38 inches; partially weathered calcareous sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bluechief (UT), Boreham (UT), Hiko Springs (UT), Kaito (AZ), Kinan (AZ), McCutchen (NV), Moffat (UT), Nakai (UT), Nakoy (UT), Nolova (UT), Nuahs (NV), Riemod (UT), Teabrush (T)(UT), and Trook (WY) series. Bluechief soils have a lithic contact. Boreham, Hiko Springs, Kaito, Kinan, McCutchen, Moffat, Nakai, Nakoy, Nolova, Nuahs, Riemod, Teabrush, and Trook soils are deeper than 40 inches. In addition, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, 29) and have precipitation that is more evenly distributed throughout the year.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pagina series are on rolling plateaus and low hills on structural benches. These soils formed in eolian sands and alluvium from sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 3,500 feet to 5,310 feet. Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F. Frost-free period is 150 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wahweap and Sheppard soils. 
Wahweap soils are shallow. Sheppard soils are sandy and very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; moderately rapid to rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing. Vegetation is mainly blackbrush, Mormon-tea, broom snakeweed, Indian ricegrass, yucca, and annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. The Pagina series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
