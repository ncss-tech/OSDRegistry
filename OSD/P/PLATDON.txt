PLATDON SERIES

The Platdon series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Platdon soils are on drainageways, flood plains, and flood plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Cumulic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Platdon loam, in wetland grasses at an elevation of 9,060 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on June 16, 1982.

     A--0 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

     Ag--8 to 18 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron, and common fine faint gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons is 10 to 24 inches)

     Cg1--18 to 30 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) very gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, nonplastic; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron, and many medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; 15 percent cobbles and 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 16 inches thick)

     2Cg2--30 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron, and many medium faint gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions; 20 percent cobbles and 50 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hovarka, Kilgore, and Lemhi series.
Hovarka, Lemhi, and Kilgore soils have less than 20 percent (weighted average) rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section. In addition, Hovarka and Lemhi soils border a xeric moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium from mixed sources
Landform:   drainageways, flood plains, and flood plain steps
Slopes:  0 to 3 percent
Elevation:   8,200 to 10,000 feet
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 40 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hodden, Adderton, and Spinth soils. Hodden soils have argillic and calcic horizons and are on outwash terraces. Adderton soils do not have endosaturation and are on more elevated positions of flood plains. Spinth soils have calcic horizons and accumulations of sodium and are on similar landforms as Platdon soils.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for grazing and recreation.  Native vegetation consists of sedges, western wheatgrass, foxtail barley, prairie junegrass, slender wheatgrass, alkali sacaton, Sandberg bluegrass, alkali bluegrass, inland saltgrass, plantain, Rocky Mountain iris, and Baltic rush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48B; moderate extent.
