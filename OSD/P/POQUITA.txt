POQUITA SERIES

The Poquita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived from "redbed" formations. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Poquita very fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 6 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 15 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 inches thick)

    Bk1--15 to 24 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/8) clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/8) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common fine masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--24 to 53 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common fine masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (11 to 29 inches thick)

    2Bk3--53 to 60 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine
pores; few fine masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Conchas, Hoban, Quay, Reagan, and Stovall series. Conchas soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Hoban soils have a gypsic horizon at 40 to 60 inches. Quay soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Reagan soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the particle-size control section. Stovall soils have a calcic horizon between 6 and 15 inches of the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Poquita soils are in broad valleys or on rolling hills. They formed in calcareous alluvium derived from "redbed" formations. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches; average annual temperature ranges from 58 to 62 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 180 to 210 days. Elevation ranges from 3,700 to 4,700 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alama, Conger, Holloman, Reeves, and the competing Reagan soils. Alama soils do not have a calcic horizon. Conger soils are less than 20 inches to a petrocalcic horizon. Holloman and Reeves soils have gypsic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland. Present vegetation includes tobosa, blue grama, burrograss, broom snakeweed, walkingstick cholla, small soapweed, and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern New Mexico. Poquita soils are not extensive.
