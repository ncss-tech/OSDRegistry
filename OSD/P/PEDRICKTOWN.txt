COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain lowlands
Landform: Broad flats and depressions along major streams and flood plains and backswamp areas of small rivers and streams
Elevation: 0 to 90 feet
Parent Material: Loamy and sandy alluvial sediments
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 42 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 180 to 215 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Askecksy soils--poorly drained with a sandy particle-size control section, on slightly higher positions
Berryland soils--spodosol with a sandy particle-size control section, on low-lying uplands
Hammonton soils--moderately well drained with an argillic horizon, on uplands
Mullica soils--with an umbric epipedon, on slightly higher-lying positions

MAJOR USES: Woodland

VEGETATION: Dominantly red maple, American Holly and sweet gum.

DISTRIBUTION: Inner Coastal Plain of New Jersey along the lowest terrace of the Delaware River and in flood plains of its tributaries.

EXTENT: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Salem County, New Jersey, 1998.

REMARKS: Pedricktown soils were previously mapped as swamps, Fluvaquents, and other poorly or very poorly drained thermic soils.

Diagnostic horizons and diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ag horizon).
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously saturated (endosaturation).
