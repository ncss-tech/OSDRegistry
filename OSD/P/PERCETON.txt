PERCETON SERIES

The Perceton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sedimentary rocks.  Perceton soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes. Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Perceton sandy loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed organic material principally needles, bark, twigs, and leaves.

    Oe--3 to 6 cm; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above.

    E--6 to 31 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak thick platy structure that parts to fine granules; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel with some cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 50 cm thick)

    E/Bt--31 to 56 cm; mixed colors including very pale brown (10YR 7/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) heavy sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist weak coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to medium subangular blocks and coarse granules; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; some of the more clayey peds are hard, very friable; thin glossy patches on some faces of the more clayey peds and in some root channels and pores; 5 percent gravel; this horizon consists of nodules and seams of clayey material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a light colored matrix like that of the overlying horizon; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt--56 to 81 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to medium and fine subangular blocks; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; peds are very hard, firm; continuous wax-like coatings on faces of peds and in roots channels and pores; wax-like bridges between sand grains; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 120 cm thick)

    BC--81 to 91 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few thin glossy patches on some faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 18 cm thick)

    Cr--91 to 157 cm; soft noncalcareous sandstone and interbedded loamstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Edloe, Grimstone, Indart, Lick, Peeler, Sapphire, Swapps, Swifton, Tahoma, Tongue River, Trapper, Uinta, Whitefish, and Woodrock series.  Edloe, Sapphire, Swapps, and Woodrock soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm.  Grimstone and Tongue River soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent fine or coarser mica of sufficient size to influence the soils physical character.  Indart soils developed in parent material weathered from redbeds, shales, and sandstones and have lithochromic hue of 5YR or redder.  Lick, Peeler, Swifton, Trapper, Uinta, and Whitefish soils lack a paralithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm.  Tahoma soils lack E or E/Bt horizons and have strongly or very strongly acid Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--hills, ridges, and mountain side slopes
Elevation--2400 to 2900 meters
Slope--4 to 60 percent
Parent material--moderately thin, moderately coarse textured noncalcareous material weathered from soft sedimentary sandstone and interbedded loamstone
Mean annual precipitation--510 mm with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer
Mean annual air temperature--2 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--11 degrees C
Frost-free period--20 to 50 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing or timber production.  Native vegetation is lodgepole pine, spruce, fir, wild rose, and juniper.
