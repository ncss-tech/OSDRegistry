PATTENBUTTE SERIES

The Pattenbutte series consists of shallow, well drained soils on backslopes and shoulder slopes of mountains. Pattenbutte soils formed in colluvium from granite with a minor influence of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and mean annual air temperature about 33 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic Lithic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pattenbutte very stony ashy sandy loam - rangeland, on a 60 percent north-facing slope at an elevation of 7,260 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise indicated.)

  A--0 to 8 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very stony ashy sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

  Bw1--8 to 12 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) very stony loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

  Bw2--12 to 16 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) extremely stony loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt irregular boundary. (3 to 4 inches thick)

  R--16 inches; granitic bedrock
