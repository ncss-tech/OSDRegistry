PINALENO SERIES

The Pinaleno series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed rock.  Pinaleno soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pinaleno very gravelly clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent subrounded gravel and 5 percent cobble; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt--1 to 5 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent subrounded gravel and 5 percent cobble; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Btk1--5 to 12 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 55 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; common calcium carbonate filaments; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.   (3 to 31 inches thick)

    Btk2--12 to 24 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel; violently effervescent; many soft calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

    C--24 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Maricopa County, Arizona; 2,400 feet west and 330 feet south of the northeast corner of section 1, T. 6 N., R. 8 W.

Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 70 percent gravel and cobble in the control section

Soil temperature: 59 to 72 degrees F.

Thickness of solum: 15 to 40 inches

Depth to calcic horizon: 5 to 40 inches

Chroma:  2 through 4 dry, 2 through 6 moist
Texture:  sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam, loamy sand  (10 to 25 percent clay)
Calcium carbonate: 8 to 25 percent or more calcium carbonate equivalent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Oldwoman (T)(CA) series. Oldwoman soils have durinodes and less than 18 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinaleno soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Elevations range from 1,500 to 5,400 feet.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature is 58 to 70 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and falls as rain mainly in July and August and much of the remainder in December, January, and February.  The frost-free period is 180 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anthony, Queencreek, Brazito, Continental, and Gila soils.  Queencreek soils are sandy-skeletal.  Continental, Gila, Anthony, and Brazito soils are not skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is a sparse cover of creosotebush, cacti, mesquite, sixweeks grama and annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico.  MLRAs 40, 41, 42. The Pinaleno soils are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Eastern Maricopa-Northern Pinal Counties Area, Arizona; 1971.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 1 inch (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 1 to 24 inches (Bt, Btk1, Btk2 horizons)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 12 to 24 inches (Btk2 horizon)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010

The classification was changed from loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids to loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calciargids in 2003 due to changes in soil classification
