POWDERRIVER SERIES

The Powderriver series consists of shallow, well-drained soils on backslopes of mountains.  Powderriver soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks mixed with a small amount of volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Lithic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Powderriver gravelly ashy sandy loam - forested, on a 40 percent southwest slope at 4,790 feet elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)

(3 to 7 inches thick)

 Bw--4 to 10 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) very gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

 C--10 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear irregular boundary.
