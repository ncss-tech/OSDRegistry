PORONTO SERIES

The Poronto series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, floodplains and depressions. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Poronto loam, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 8 cm; slightly decomposed organic matter. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A--8 to 33 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redox concentrations; moderate medium granular structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 40 cm thick)

    Bg1--33 to 48 cm; dark gray (5YR 4/1) very gravelly silty clay loam, light gray (5YR 7/1) dry; many medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bg2--48 to 78 cm; dark gray (5YR 4/1) very gravelly clay loam, light gray (5YR 7/1) dry; many fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral; (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bg1 and Bg2 horizons - 30 to 60 cm)

    Bg3--78 to 159 cm; dark gray (5YR 4/1) very gravelly sandy loam, gray (5YR 6/1) dry; few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).
