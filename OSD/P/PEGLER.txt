PEGLER SERIES

The soils of the Pegler series are shallow, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks over residuum from soft tuff. They are on rock pediments. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, mesic, shallow Vitrixerandic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pegler ashy fine sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partly covered with 10 percent volcanic and obsidian gravel.

    A--0 to 5 cm, light gray (10YR 7/2) ashy fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick).

    Bw1--5 to 13 cm, pale brown (10YR 6/3) ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak, medium prismatic and moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; common faint colloidal clay coatings on sand grains; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 18 cm thick).

    2Bw2--13 to 25 cm, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) paragravelly ashy sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate, medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine through coarse roots, medium and coarse roots are horizontal at the lower boundary; many very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; 20 percent paragravel; common faint colloidal clay coatings on sand grains; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear irregular boundary.(10 to 15 cm thick).

    2Crk--25 to 36 cm, fractured tuff, slightly curved fracture planes; many 0.5 millimeter thick carbonate coats in fractures; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary.

    2Cr--36 to 76 cm, fractured, weathered tuff. 

TYPE LOCATION: Washoe County, Nevada; about 1,820 feet south and 1,920 feet east of the northwest corner of section 10, T.36 N., R.19 E.; USGS Juniper Springs, NV 7.5 minute quadrangle; 41 degrees, 1 minute, 3.53 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees, 50 minutes, 18.88 seconds west longitude; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.0176472 latitude, -119.8385778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture -  Usually dry; dry summer and fall, moist in late winter and spring. Aridic bordering xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature - 8.3 to 10.0 C.
Depth to a paralithic contact - 25 to 36 cm.
Mineralogy -  40 to 75 percent volcanic glass in the 0.2 to 2.0 mm fraction.

Control section:  Clay content - 18 to 24 percent.
Rock fragments - 0 to 10 percent volcanic gravel; 0 to 30 percent paragravel, usually less than 10 percent in all horizons except immediately above the paralithic contact.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Sodicity: SAR is 0 to 5.

Bw horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture: Dominantly ashy sandy clay loam or ashy sandy loam, subhorizons of ashy loam are in some pedons.
Other features: few or common collodial stains on sand grains and gravel in the lower part.
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Sodicity: SAR is 0 to 5.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jackpot and Weash series. Jackpot soils have 5 to 10 percent clay in the control section. Weash soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the A horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pegler soils are on rock pediments at elevations of 1,375 to 1,525 meters. These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium from mixed volcanic and sedimentary rocks over residuum from soft tuff. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of about 200 to 250 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.3 degrees C. The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Nopeg and Old Camp soils. Nopeg soils have Bw horizons with SAR greater than 13 and have a typic aridic soil moisture regime. Old Camp soils have lithic contacts, loamy-skeletal control sections and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is principally Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Washoe County, Nevada, Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area; MLRA 23. These soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California and Nevada, 1974.

REMARKS: The classification of the series is changed (5/2000) based on optical grain counts of volcanic glass and field investigation of the series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 18 cm (A, Bw1 and part of 2Bw horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 25 cm (The Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizons).
Paralithic contact - The contact at 25 cm (2Crk horizon).
The particle size control section - The zone from 0 to 25 cm (The A, Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizons).
Mineralogy - Glass content of the .2 to 2 millimeter fraction is more than 30 percent.
