PIERVIEW SERIES


The Pierview series are well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from slate and other sedimentary sources. Pierview soils are on remnant alluvial fans and terraces, often in urban areas where surface modification is common. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 410 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Haplic Palexeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Pierview loam, on a city park lawn at an elevation of 63 meters. When described the soil was moist at the surface and dry in the subsurface. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 2Bt3--130 to 170 centimeters; dull yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).

 2Bt4--170 to 185 centimeters; dull yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on all faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.1). (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 115 to 178 cm thick)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: highly weathered alluvial fan remnants. 
Slopes: 0 to 12 percent and may be modified with construction equipment. Parent material: alluvium weathered from slate and other related sedimentary sources underlying a thin discontinuous layer of human-transported materials at the surface.
