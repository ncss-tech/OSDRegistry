PERECHENEY SERIES

The Perecheney series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy outwash underlain by stratified loamy and sandy glaciofluvial deposits. These soils are on ground moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Durkeelake series. Durkeelake soils do not have a sandy substratum in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Perecheney soils are on ground moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The Perecheney soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy and sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Croswell, Graycalm, Grayling, Klacking, Leafriver, and Tawas soils. The moderately well drained Croswell soils formed entirely in sandy material. The somewhat excessively drained Graycalm soils, the excessively drained Grayling soils, and the well drained Klacking soils are on similar or slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Leafriver and Tawas soils are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Water is perched on the 2Bt horizon. Potential for surface runoff is very low to medium depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately high in the underlying loamy material. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and moderately slow in the underlying loamy material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. A small percentage is cultivated and used for growing hay.  Common tree species include red oak, red maple, jack pine, red pine, quaking aspen and black cherry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 98 in northern Lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
