PRUITTON SERIES

The Pruitton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy and gravelly alluvium. The soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Fluventic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Pruitton silt loam in a nearly level cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 5 percent by volume chert fragments 1/4 to 1 inch across; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--9 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; 2 percent by volume chert fragments 1/4 to 1 inch across; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    Bw2--26 to 38 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; 5 percent by volume chert fragments 1/4 to 1 inch across; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 16 to 45 inches)

     2C1--38 to 45 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; 15 percent by volume chert fragments 1/8 to 1 inch across; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 30 inches thick)

     2C2--45 to 52 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam; common fine distinct dark brown (10YR 3/3) mottles; massive; very friable; 35 percent by volume chert fragments 1/8 to 1 inch across; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Lauderdale County, Alabama; 3/4 mile northwest of Pruitton in SW1/4NE1/4 sec. 6, T1 S., R. 10 W. in crop field west of Butler Creek. USGS Pruitton Quad; (Latitude: 34 degrees 59 minutes 55 seconds N; Longitude: 87 degrees 37 minutes 24 seconds W)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid, except for the surface layer, where limed. Coarse chert fragment ranges from none to 15 percent by volume in the A and Bw horizons and from 15 to 75 percent by volume in the C horizon. The thickness of the surface epipedon with value of 3 and chroma of 3 is less than 10 inches.

The Ap and A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam.

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and
chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is dominantly silt loam or loam, but the range can include clay loam or silty clay loam.

The 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3
to 6. Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and gray range from
none to many. Texture of the fine earth fraction is dominantly silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam, but the range can include sandy loam and silty clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES: These include Ennis series in the same family.
Ennis soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the 10 to 40 inch control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pruitton soils are on flood plains primarily in narrow strips along drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in alluvium washed from soils derived from limestone, shale, sandstone, and loess. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 59.9 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 55.6 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Ennis series and Lobelville, Bodine, Dickson, Sengtown, Humphreys, Minvale, and Mountview series. Bodine, Sengtown, Humphreys, Minvale, and Mountview soils have argillic horizons. Dickson soils have a fragipan. Lobelville soils have redox depletions of chroma two or less within 24 inches of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low to negligible runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cleared and used for growing corn, cotton, soybeans, small grain, grain sorghum, and pasture. The native vegetation was mixed bottomland hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Limestone Valley and Highland Rim of Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lauderdale County, Alabama; 1973.

REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped in the Ennis series. Ennis series has been reclassified and the range in characteristics requires a weighted average of 15 to 35 percent fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section. When the OSD was updated in 2001 the lithological discontinuity was inadvertently left off of the C1 and C2 in the OSD description and range of characteristics.
Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)

Cambic horizon - from 9 to about 38 inches (Bw horizons)
