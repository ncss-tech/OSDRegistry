PARDEEVILLE SERIES

The Pardeeville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous loamy sand or sandy loam glacial till on uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pardeeville fine sandy loam - on a 4 percent slope in a once cultivated area at an elevation of about 253 meters (830 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

   E--20 to 23 cm (8 to 9 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/3) loamy sand with few tongues of dark brown (7.5YR 3/2); weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  [0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches) thick]

   BE--23 to 38 cm (9 to 15 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  [10 to 18 cm (4 to 7 inches) thick]

   Bt1--38 to 64 cm (15 to 25 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; faint patchy clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.[15 to 28 cm (6 to 11 inches) thick]

   Bt2--64 to 86 cm (25 to 34 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure, peds break to plates; friable; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) organic coatings on faces of peds at lower boundary; few faint clay films on faces of subangular blocky peds and clay bridging between sand grains distinctive toward lower boundary where structure weakens; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

   C--86 to 173 cm (34 to 68 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam; massive; friable; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Marquette County, Wisconsin; about 7 miles south and 3 miles east of Montello; about 1,500 feet north and 1370 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 14, T. 14 N., R. 10 E. USGS Observatory Hill, Wisconsin Topographic Quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 41 minutes 28 seconds N., and long. 89 degrees 16 minutes 15 seconds W.,  NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Depth to carbonates: more than 102 cm (40 inches)
Particle-size control section:  averages 10 to 18 percent clay, 45 to 75 percent fine sand or coarser
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum; neutral in the upper part, when  limed; slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum
Volume of gravel in the upper part of the solum: 0 to 10 percent; 2 to 20 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the 
substratum

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: fine sandy loam

E horizon (where present):
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sandy loam or loamy sand

BE horizon:
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: sandy loam

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: loam or sandy loam; thin horizons of sandy clay loam are in some pedons

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: sandy loam or loamy sand or the gravelly analogues

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Forkhorn, Hazen, Kevilar, and Rusktown series. Forkhorn and Hazen soils have more than 75 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Kevilar and Rusktown have redox features and saturation in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pardeeville soils are on ground and end moraines.  Slopes are undulating to rolling and range from 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in thick deposits of reddish-colored loamy sand or sandy loam glacial till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 815 mm (28 to 32 inches).  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 7.8 to 10.6 degrees C (46 to 51 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coloma, Lapeer, Locke, and Wyocena.  All of these soils are on similar landscape positions and are distinguished from the Pardeeville soils, principally on the development of the B horizon or thickness and color of the A horizon.  Coloma soils have thinner, lighter-colored A horizons and coarser-textured sola.  Lapeer soils have somewhat thinner and lighter-colored A horizons.  Locke soils are on contiguous lower-lying sites or depressions where drainage is impeded.  Wyocena soils have lighter-colored surface horizons and coarser textures within depths of 102 cm (40 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) . Permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of this soil has been cleared and is used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Ome areas are used for pastureland or woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed grass and forest vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 95B in central Wisconsin. This soil is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Marquette County, Wisconsin, June, 1969.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 38 to 86 cm (15 to 34 inches) (Bt1, Bt2);  Mollic subgroup - have an Ap horizon with color value moist of less than 4 and color value of less than 6.

05/06  The location for the typical pedon (TP) in the OSD does not agree with the location given for the same pedon (TUD) in the published soil survey. The location in the OSD appears to be incorrect since it places the site in a wooded area and the TP has a plow layer. The location for the TUD has been used in the OSD.
