PENNEY SERIES

The Penney series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in thick beds of sandy eolian or marine deposits.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 69 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, uncoated Lamellic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Penney fine sand--on a 2 percent north facing slope in a wooded area.

     A--0 to 3 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) fine sand; single grained; loose; few fine and medium roots; many uncoated sand grains; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

     E1--3 to 17 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sand; single grained; loose; few fine roots; common black (10YR 2/1) charcoal fragments; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     E2--17 to 45 inches yellow (10YR 7/6) fine sand; single grained; loose; few fine and coarse roots; many uncoated sand grains; few black (10YR 2/1) charcoal fragments; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     E3--45 to 57 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sand; single grained; loose; few medium roots; many uncoated sand grains; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the E horizons ranges from 47 to 72 inches.)

     E&B--57 to 80 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) (E) fine sand; single grained; loose; many uncoated sand grains; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loamy fine sand lamellae (B) about 3 to 6 mm in thickness and 3 to 8 inches in length; individual lamellae are discontinuous; sand grains are well coated; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Clay County, Florida; approximately 1,600 feet north and 1,600 feet east of the southwest corner of Sec. 6, T. 6 S., R. 26 E.; about 1.5 miles north of State Road 16 and about 800 feet west of dirt road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 80 inches or more.  Content of silt plus clay is less than 5 percent between depths of 10 to 40 inches.  Lamellae occur in the soil at depths below 50 inches, generally increasing in thickness with depth.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is fine sand or sand.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Streaks or pockets of uncoated sand grains range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.

The E part of the E&B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is 2 to 8 inches thick between the lamellae.  Small pockets of clean sand grains in shades of gray or white in the E part of this horizon range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.

The B part of the E&B horizon is discontinuous lamellae with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lamellae range from 2 to 8mm in thickness and 1/2 to 24 inches in length.  Texture of the lamellae is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam. 
 
COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known series in the same family.
   
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Penney soils are on uplands.  They formed in thick beds of eolian or marine deposits of coarse-textured materials.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The climate is humid semitropical.  The average annual temperature ranges from 67 to 72 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Albany, Blanton, Centenary, Ortega, and Troup soils.  Albany, Blanton, and Troup soils have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 40 to 80 inches thick underlain by Bt horizons.  In addition, Albany soils are on lower positions and are somewhat poorly drained, Blanton soils are on lower positions and are moderately well to somewhat excessively drained, and Troup soils are on similar positions and are somewhat excessively drained.  The well to somewhat excessively drained Centenary soils are on lower positions and have a Bh horizon below 50 inches.  The moderately well drained Ortega series are on lower positions and do not have lamellae.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Penney soils are in natural vegetation.  Some areas have been cleared and are in pasture.  The natural vegetation is dominantly turkey oak, bluejack oak, post oak, scrub live oak, and longleaf pine.  The understory is chiefly a sparse growth of pineland threeawn, indiangrass, creeping bluestem, and panicums.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is of moderate extent and is extensive in northeast Florida.
