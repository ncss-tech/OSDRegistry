PROPOSAL SERIES 

The Proposal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on high stream terraces and outwash plains in intermountian valleys.  These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Proposal silt loam, in irrigated grass hay (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and partially decomposed matted roots; abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - Stream terraces and outwash plains
Elevation - 5,900 to 6,500 feet. 
Slope - 0 to 2 percent. 
Parent material - Mixed alluvium

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

These are the Cowcamp and Bighole soils.  The Cowcamp soils are loamy skeletal and are in concave positions; the Bighole soils have an argillic horizon and are on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Proposal soils are used for irrigated grass hay and irrigated pasture.  The vegetation is mainly Garrison creeping foxtail, meadow foxtail, timothy, tufted hairgrass, and other miscellaneous sedges, rushes and forbs.
