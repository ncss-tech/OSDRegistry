PAREHAT SERIES

The Parehat series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on bottomlands, alluvial fans and low terraces.  Parehat soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources influenced by loess.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Parehat silt loam - pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 9 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown  (10YR 3/2) moist; upper 2 inches weak fine and medium platy structure parting to weak very fine granular, lower part weak very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores in the upper 2 inches and tubular pores in the upper 2 inches and tubular pores in the lower part; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (9 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 17 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak very fine  and medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; very few hard (cicada) krotovinas; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

    Ab1--17 to 27 inches; gray (N 6/) silt loam, very dark gray (N 3/) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine, fine and medium granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; common hard (cicada) krotovinas; strongly effervescent, few streak and lime spots; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Ab2--27 to 36 inches; gray (N 5/0) and gray (N 6/0) crushed, silt loam, very dark gray (N 3/) moist; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk1--36 to 42 inches; gray (N 6/0) and light gray (N 7/0) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; few fine distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) mottles; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine and fine and few medium tubular pores; strongly effervescent, few fine veins, streaks and lime splotches; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--42 to 53 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many very fine and common fine and medium tubular pores; violently effervescent, common streaks and lime splotches; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    C--53 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).  (0 to 20 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Power County, Idaho; SW 1/4 SE 1/4 section 20, T.7s., R.33E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The soils are not saturated throughout, but are saturated within 40 inches of the surface for 90 to 120 days unless artificially drained.  Buried A horizons are common and the organic matter content does not decrease regularly with increasing depth.
Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are at a depth of 20 to 30 inches.
Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 19 inches
Average annual soil temperature - 47 to 53 degrees F.
Average annual summer soil temperature - 64 to 70 degrees F.
Control section average - Percent clay: 18 to 27

A horizon
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 1 through 3 dry or moist
Effervescence - noneffervescent to strongly effervescent
Reaction - Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline

Bk horizon
Hue - 2.5Y, N or 10YR
Value - 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma - 0 through 2 dry or moist

C horizon
Hue - 2.5Y, N or 10YR
Value - 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma - 0 through 2, dry or moist
Texture: Silt loam or loam
Some pedons are salt and alkaline affected
Some subhorizons are noncalcareous

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Kirkham series.  Kirkham soils do not have a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Parehat soils are on level to very gently sloping bottomland, alluvial fans, or low terraces.  They formed in alluvium from mixed sources influenced by loess.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation is 2,200 to 4,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 15 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Penoyer, Tickason and Baldock soils.  Penoyer and Tickason soils lack mottles above a depth of 40 inches.  Baldock and Penoyer soils lack a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  A high water table is at 2 to 4 feet sometime during the months of May through September. Most areas may be flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture, hayland and some irrigated potatoes and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Idaho.  These soils are not extensive (about 8,300 acres).  MLRAs 11 and 28A.
