PARAJE SERIES

The Paraje series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and loess.  Paraje soils are on shoulders and beveled summits of eroded fan remnants and backslopes of low hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Paraje soils are on shoulders and beveled summits of eroded fan remnants and on backslopes of low hills.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; and from Quaternary loess.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 7,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golondrina and Agua Fria soils.  Golondrina soils have mollic epipedons, argillic horizons that have moderate increase in clay from the surface, and occur on adjacent backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Agua Fria soils are fine-loamy and are on adjacent summits of eroded fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; permeability is slow in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Paraje soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, galleta, black grama, sideoats grama, New Mexico feathergrass, twoneedle pinyon, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Gravelly(R036XB114NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Paraje soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
