PUNG SERIES

The Pung series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from tertiary sediments.  Pung soils are on terrace side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:   These are the Simas and Steerlake series.  Simas soils have more than 50 percent clay throughout the argillic horizon. Steerlake soils have slickensides, wedge-shaped aggregates, or vertical cracks in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Pung soils are on side slopes and summit areas of terraces at elevations of 1,830 to 2,135 meters.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from tertiary sediments.  The summers are hot and dry and the winters are cold and wet.  Precipitation is mostly snow in winter months and rain in spring months. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 cm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 90 to ll0 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chalco, Puett, Phing, Pulcan, Uhaldi, and Verdico soils.  Chalco, Puett, Phing, and Verdico soils lack a mollic epipedon.  In addition, Chalco soils are shallow; Puett soils are shallow and lack an argillic horizon; and Verdico soils are moderately deep.  Pulcan soils have a very gravelly argillic horizon.  Uhaldi have a fine-loamy argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Thurbers needlegrass, Canby bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are inextensive. MLRA 26.
