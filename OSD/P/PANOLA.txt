PANOLA SERIES
The Panola series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from calcareous clay beds and thin layers of limestone of Cretaceous
age.  These soils are on broad nearly level to very gently sloping coastal prairies.  They have a perched water table at a depth of
0.5 to 1.0 foot late in the fall and early spring.  Water runs off the surface slowly.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Vertic Epiaqualfs
TYPICAL PEDON:  Panola silty clay loam--pasture.
       (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)
     A1--0 to 8 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky and moderate medium and fine blocky structure; firm; strongly acid; clear
smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)
     B21t--8 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), silty
clay loam; common fine faint brown mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky and moderate fine blocky structure; very firm; common brown and black concretions 1 to 4 mm in diameter; thin
dark gray (10YR 4/1) coatings of clay films on faces of peds;
clean sand and silt grains on faces of peds; strongly acid;
graudal wavy boundary.  (5 to 18 inches thick)
     B22t--13 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam;
common fine faint yellowish brown and light brownish gray mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very firm; thick coatings of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam on faces of peds; clean sand grains and silt coatings on faces of peds; clay films
on faces of peds; common brown and black concretions 1 to 10 mm in diameter; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 8 inches
thick)
     B23tg--20 to 35 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) and grayish
brown (10YR 5/2) clay; many fine and medium distinct yellowish
brown (10YR 5/6) and few fine distinct strong brown mottles;
moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse blocky structure; extremely firm; thin silt coatings on top
of prisms; clay films on surfaces of peds; few brown and black concretions and stains; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (15
to 25 inches thick)
     B24tg--35 to 51 inches; mottled gray (10YR 6/1) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay; common fine prominent yellowish red, brown, and red mottles; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine blocky structure; extremely firm; clay
films on surfaces of peds; gray coating in the matrix; many slickensides, few intersecting below 40 inches; few dark gray
(10YR 4/1) streaks and pockets; few gypsum crystals; medium acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 40 inches thick)
     B3g--51 to 72 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) clay; many coarse
distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; moderate fine blocky structure; very firm; common brown and black concretions and
stains; few gypsum crystals; mildly alkaline.
Type Loation:  McCurtain County, Oklahoma; about 1 1/2 miles southeast of Millerton, Oklahoma, on U. S. Highway 70; about 1,500 feet north and 50 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 3, T.
7 S., R. 22 E.
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 70 inches.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 through
3.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.  The boundary between the A
and B horizon is wavy or smooth.
The B21t horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1
or 2.  It has grayish, brownish, or reddish mottles.  The B21t horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and
ranges from very strongly acid through neutral.
The B22t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6,
and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has grayish, brownish, or reddish mottles.  It has the same texture and reaction as the B21t
horizon.
The B23tg or B24tg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma 1 through 4, or it has a mottled reddish, brownish, or grayish matrix.  It ranges from medium acid through mildly alkaline.  Some pedons contain a few fine calcium carbonate nodules.
The B3g horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 through 6,
and chroma of 2 through 4, or the matrix is mottled reddish,
brownish or grayish.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.
COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acadia, Baldwin, Forestdale,
Mayhew, Midland, Sessum, Tensas, and Wilson series.  Acadia and Forestdale soils do not crack in dry seasons.  Baldwin, Mayhew, Midland, Sessum, and Wilson soils have grayer Bt horizons to 30 inches.  Tensas soils have a solum thickness of less than 50
inches.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Panola soils are on nearly level very gently sloping uplands of the coastal prairies.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is 43 to 50 inches; Thornthwaite P-E indices are 72
to 80.
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crowley,
Hollywood, Kipling, and Lake Charles series.  Crowley soils have
an abrupt textural change between the A2 and Bt horizons.
Hollywood and Lake Charles soils have 30 percent or more clay in
all horizons and intersecting slickensides below 20 inches.
Kipling soils lack dominant chroma of 2 or less in the Bt horizon.  DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow or
medium runoff; very slow permeability.  A perched water table is
at a depth of 0.5 to 1.0 foot during November through April.
USE AND VEGETATION:  The principal use is pasture and native
range.  A few areas are cultivated and used for sorghums,
soybeans, cotton, and wheat.
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Oklahoma, possibly
