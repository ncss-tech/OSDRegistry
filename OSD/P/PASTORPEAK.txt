PASTORPEAK SERIES

The Pastorpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartz diorite and sandstone.  Pastorpeak soils are on backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 50 to 95 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adellern (NM), Braziel (MT), Fessler (MT), Mapache (NM), Pastorius (AZ) and Zillion (UT) series.  Adellern soils are deeper than 40 inches to accumulations of calcium carbonate.  Mapache soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from latite and dacite of the Tertiary age Tschicoma Formation and are slightly acid or neutral throughout. Pastorius soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Zillion soils have clay contents in the particle-size control section ranging from 27 to 35 percent and the base of the argillic horizon is less than 30 inches.  Braziel and Fessler soils are moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pastorpeak soils are on backslopes of mountains.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Tertiary quartz diorite and Jurassic sandstone.  Slopes are 50 to 95 percent.  Elevation ranges from 7,500 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bigpaw, Ligai, and Zibetod soils.  Bigpaw soils are fine-silty and occur on footslopes.  Ligai soils are moderately deep and occur on adjacent backslopes.  Zibetod soils are shallow and occur on footslopes and shoulders of domes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the fragmental substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pastorpeak soils are used for livestock grazing and timber production.  Present vegetation is Douglas fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of nodding bromegrass, mountain snowberry, Gambel oak, western chokecherry, Utah serviceberry, rockspirea, and littleleaf mockorange.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Pastorpeak soils are of small extent on the Carrizo Mountains portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona.  MLRA is 35.
