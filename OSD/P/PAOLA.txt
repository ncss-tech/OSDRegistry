PAOLA SERIES

The Paola series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy marine sediments.  Paola soils are on hills, ridges, and flats on marine terraces. Slopes are linear to convex and range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Hyperthermic, uncoated Spodic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Paola sand, in a linear to convex forest at elevation of 16 meters (53 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil.)

	A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) sand; single grain; loose; organic matter and white (10YR 8/1) sand on the surface give the appearance of salt and pepper; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; very strongly acid pH 4.7; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 18 centimeters (2 to 7 inches) thick] 

	E--8 to 64 centimeters (3 to 25 inches); light gray (10YR 7/1) sand with few splotches of brown (10YR 5/3) and very dark brown (10YR 2/2) stains along old root channels; single grain; loose; common fine and medium roots; very strongly acid pH 4.7; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 152 centimeters (6 to 60 inches) thick] 

	B/E--64 to 119 centimeters (25 to 47 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand (Bw); single grain; loose; few tongues filled with light gray (10YR 7/1) sand  (E) ; outer edges of the tongues are stained with grayish brown (10YR 5/2) organic material that, in places, are weakly cemented; few to common, coarse to fine soft spherical very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) concretions throughout; thin layers of reddish brown (5YR 4/3) weakly cemented sand occur at irregular intervals at the contact between the E horizon and the B horizon; few fine roots; very strongly acid pH 4.7; gradual wavy boundary. [30 to more than 127 centimeters (12 to more than 50 inches) thick] 

	C--119 to 203 centimeters (47 to 80 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose; very strongly acid pH 4.7.
