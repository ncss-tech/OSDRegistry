PAPAGUA SERIES

The Papagua series consists of deep, moderately well drained, nearly level, slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy eolian sediments of Holocene age over loamy alluvial sediments of Quaternary age.  These nearly level soils are in depressions.  The soil is ponded for short periods after heavy rains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).

Papalote soils: are on convex shoulder positions and do not have an aquic moisture regime in most years.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is negligible.  The soil ponds for short periods after heavy rains.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing and forage production.  A few areas are used for crop production, mostly grain sorghum.  Native grasses include plains bristlegrass, lovegrass tridens, witchgrass, and threeawns.  Woody vegetation is mainly mesquite, huisache, and spiny hackberry.  The ecological site is Lakebed, (R083EY721TX).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jim Wells County, Texas; 1976.

REMARKS:  Papagua soils were formerly included in a depressional phase of the Papalote series.  The typifying pedon was moved to the Brooks County type location in 2006.  Local lab data is available at this site.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: 30 to 81 cm (12 to 32 in). (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in). (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 30 to 178 cm (12 to 70 in). (Btg1, Btg2, Btgk, and Btk horizons)
