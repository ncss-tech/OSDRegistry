PERUROSE SERIES

The Perurose series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Perurose soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Perurose soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Elevations range from 290 to 780 meters (951 to 2,560 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coxpin and Pintobasin soils. Coxpin soils are on similar landscape positions and Pintobasin soils are on adjacent fan aprons. Coxpin soils are 36 to 50 centimeters deep to a weakly to moderately cemented duripan. Pintobasin soils are very deep and have no diagnostic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above and below the duripan and moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity within the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Perurose soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush and burrobush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
