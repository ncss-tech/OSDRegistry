Cg--72 to 84 inches; gray (N 5/) clay; massive, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Washington County, North Carolina; approximately two miles northwest of Pungo Lake, 0.4 mile north of Property Line Canal, and 200 feet east of the Canal. (Approximate location of Dolman site No. 5--see additional data.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the Organic Layers: 51 to more than 80 inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 12 inches, November to May
Soil Reaction: Ultra acid to extremely acid in the organic horizons and extremely acid to neutral in the underlying mineral horizons
Other Features: Logs, stumps, and roots occupy up to 35 percent of the surface area and subsurface volume. Unrubbed fiber content ranges from 2 to 60 percent throughout the profile. Rubbed fiber content of middle and lower tiers ranges to 12 percent in some pedons. Charcoal content ranges from common in surface layers to few in subsurface layers. 

Oa horizons:
Color--The surface layer has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Subsurface layers have hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 4, or have neutral with value of 2 or 3. Ten inches or more of the subsurface tier is in hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.
Texture--muck or woody muck. The organic material is massive and is paste-like and has a slick feel when wet. After drainage and subsidence, the organic material forms weak subangular blocky structure if allowed to aerate slowly. When this material dries over a short period of time, it shrinks and does not rewet.

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, or is 5GY to 5BG, value of 3 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 3 to 7
Texture--loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay. Some pedons may have thin layers of loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam textures.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Agricultural Drainage: Very poorly drained
Permeability: Slow

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Mostly woodland
Dominant Vegetation: Some areas are vegetated with scattered pond pine (Pinus serotina) and a dense undergrowth of large holly and small gallberry (Ilex spp.) and huckleberry (Gavlussacia spp.), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), scattered maple (Acer spp.), red bay (Persea borbonia), sweetbay magnolia (Magnolia Virginiana), and switch cane (Arundinaria tecta). Areas with a history of severe burning usually have a smaller population of these species and contain large amounts of broomsedge (Andropogon spp.) and other grasses and briers. These soils also support mixed hardwood forests dominated by tupelo (Nyssa spp.), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), and other hydrophytic species 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Virginia
Extent: Small 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, North Carolina; 1979.

REMARKS: The organic matter in the Pungo soils consists of very finely decomposed sapric material.
