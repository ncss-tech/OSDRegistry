PORSER SERIES

The Porser series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, outwash and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Porser soils are on outwash plains, fan remnants, and benches. Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 36 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atrac, Chupadera, and Hernandez series, which have an aridic moisture regime bordering ustic. The Atrac soils are fine-loamy and do not have a calcic horizon. The Chupadera soils are coarse-loamy. The Hernandez soils are fine-loamy.  In Emery County, Utah, these are the fine-loamy Notter and Whitesage soils, which are on alluvial fans under Wyoming big sagebrush.  Notter soils have a mollic epipedon and an argillic horizon.  Both Notter and Whitesage soils have a frigid temperature regime.

USE AND VEGETATION: Native vegetation includes birchleaf mountain mahogany, Salina wildrye, needleandthread, black sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, Mormon tea, bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Utah serviceberry. This soil is correlated to Upland Stony Loam (Pinyon-Utah Juniper) RO34XY33OUT ecological site at the type location.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah, Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; moderate extent; about 14,500 hectares (36,000 acres) in Carbon and Emery Counties, Utah.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carbon County, Utah, Carbon Area soil survey area, Utah, 2011. The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 13 cm.  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 119 cm.  (Bk horizons)
Outwash plain needs to be investigated.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
