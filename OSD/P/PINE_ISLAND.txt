COMPETING SERIES:
These are the Fort Caswell and Whalehead soils.
Fort Caswell soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms, formed in estuarine deposits, sometimes contain relict spodic horizons, and are in estuaries that have a water salinity between 15 and 30 parts per thousand.
Whalehead soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms and have a lithologic discontinuity.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape--Barrier-island lagoons
Landform--Relict flood-tidal delta flats and slopes, or shoals
Parent material--Sandy lagoonal deposits with origin from marine and eolian sands
Slope--0 to 1 percent
Water depth range--0 to 2 meters (0 to 7 feet) below mean sea level
Water salinity range--0.5 to 5 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Kill Devil, Kitty Hawk, Lost, Trinity Harbor soils.
Kill Devil soils--are on fluviomarine bottoms, mainland coves, and low-energy lagoon bottoms and formed in fine-loamy estuarine deposits.
Kitty Hawk soils--are on washover fans and contain hypersulfidic materials.
Lost soils--are on submerged tidal marshes and formed in loamy estuarine deposits.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately high to very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by brackish water. The water level is primarily driven by wind tides.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--The area is used for recreational fishing, swimming, hunting, and boating. Uses also include commercial fishing and crabbing.
Typical vegetation--Vegetation includes widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata), wild celery (Vallisneria americana), southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis), stonewort (Nitella sp.), and invasive Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). Vegetation coverage is generally greater than 50 percent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Region

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Currituck County, North Carolina, 2026

REMARKS:
The series is named after the historic Pine Island Hunt Club located in Corolla, North Carolina. This location is now known as the Pine Island Audubon Sanctuary and provides critical habitat for waterfowl along the Atlantic Flyway. Pine Island soils were previously mapped as water in North Carolina and Virginia soil surveys.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022):
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 23 centimeters.
Fluidity--The zone from 119 to 157 centimeters has a fluidity class of slightly fluid.
Hyposulfidic materials--The zone from 0 to 67 centimeters has an initial pH that decreases by 1 or more units but remains at a value of 4.0 or more after 16 weeks of moist aerobic incubation.
Peraquic feature--Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface (permanently submerged).
