PYOTE SERIES

The Pyote series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy and loamy sediments that have been modified by wind.  These soils are on nearly level to gently undulating uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Arenic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pyote fine sand - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry conditions unless specified otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sand, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose, very friable; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    E1--4 to 21 inches, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grain; loose, very friable; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (12 to 24 inches thick)

    E2--21 to 36 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grain, loose, very friable; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick).

    Bt1--36 to 44 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable; few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine continuous tubular pores; faint clay films between sand grains; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2--44 to 55 inches, yellowish red (5YR 5/8) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; hard, very friable; few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; clay bridging between sand grains; faint clay films on surfaces of peds; few black (10YR 2/1) manganese stains on surfaces of peds; common fine and medium irregular masses of iron-manganese; slightly alkaline; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick).

    Bt3--55 to 63 inches, yellowish red (5YR 5/8) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; hard, very friable; few coarse roots; common fine continuous tubular pores; faint clay bridging between sand grains; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

    BCt--63 to 74 inches, yellowish red (5YR 5/8) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to medium subangular blocky; few medium and coarse roots; hard, very friable; few medium continuous tubular pores; faint clay bridging between sand grains; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    BCK--74 to 80 inches; white (10YR 8/1) gravelly fine sandy loam; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; 20 percent caliche pebbles from 1/4 inch to 2 inches across; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Winkler County, Texas; from the junction of Texas Highway 115 and Texas Highway 18 in Kermit: 1.25 miles north on Texas Highway 18; 0.45 mile west on oiled road; 0.5 mile north on caliche road; 45 feet east in range. (Latitude: 31 degrees, 52 minutes, 37 seconds North; Longitude: 103 degrees, 06 minutes, 35 seconds West.)

Some pedons are leached of calcium carbonate below 80 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pyote soils are on nearly level to undulating uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in reddish sandy unconsolidated sediments of eolian or alluvial origin.  The climate is arid to semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches and mean annual temperatures ranges from 57 to 66 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 210 to 240 and elevation ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are less than 24.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Elgee series and the Kermit, Mentone, Penwell, Sharvana and Wickett series.  Elgee soils are in similar positions.  Kermit and Penwell soils do not have argillic horizons and are in similar positions.  Sharvana soils have petrocalcic horizons within 20 inches and are in similar or slightly higher positions.  Mentone soils do not have argillic horizons and are in playas in lower positions.  Wickett soils have petrocalcic horizons between 20 and 40 inches and are in similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 3 percent, and very low on 3 to 5 percent slopes.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for native rangeland.  Dropseeds, perennial threeawns, hooded windmill, and black grama are the principal grasses.  Sandsage, and mesquite trees are the woody plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Trans-Pecos of Texas (MLRA 42) and southeastern New Mexico. The series is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Ward County, Texas; 1969.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 36 inches.  (A and E horizons)

Argillic horizon - 36 to 74 inches.  (Bt and BCt horizons)

Calcic  horizon - The zone from 74 to 80 inches (BCK horizon)

Classification change from loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Ustollic Haplargids to loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Ustalfic Haplargids based on NSSL data (S91TX-495-038) from the type location, and reference samples from Crane, Loving and Ward counties, Texas.  The sand/clay ratio is >13 and organic carbon is less than 0.15.
