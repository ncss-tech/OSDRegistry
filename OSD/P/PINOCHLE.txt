PINOCHLE SERIES

The Pinochle series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from rhyolite.  Pinochle soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pinochle gravelly loam, on a west facing, convex, 48 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,950 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones.

 A--0 to 12 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1), moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (12 to 33 cm thick)                                                                                          

 AB--12 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly silt loam, very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common medium and coarse, and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 28 cm thick)                                            

 Bw1--30 to 42 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely flaggy silt loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and medium and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 10 percent channers, and 45 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.          

 Bw2--42 to 55 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely flaggy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common medium roots in cracks and a continuous root mat at the contact between Bw2 and R horizons; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent channers and 60 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 25 to 38 cm)            

 R--55 cm; rhyolite bedrock.
