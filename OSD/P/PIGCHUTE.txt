PIGCHUTE SERIES

The Pigchute series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, residuum, and till derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks. The Pigchute soils are on mountain slopes and lateral moraines of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 25 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Merkel and Roop soils. Merkel soils have a densic contact at 50 to 100 cm and have ashy surface horizons. Roop soils have hard andesite bedrock at 50 to 100 cm and have an umbric epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pigchute soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes and lateral moraines. Slopes range from 25 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium, residuum, and till derived from granitic and metamorphic rocks. Elevation is 1600 to 3000 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 2 to 9 degrees C. The frost free season is 70 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lackey, Tuohy, and Windowpeak soils. The Lackey soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes, have an umbric epipedon, and are sandy-skeletal. The Tuohy soils are on linear to convex backslopes of structural benches and mountain slopes, and are shallow to hard bedrock. Windowpeak soils are on linear backslopes and footslopes of mountain slopes and moraines in glacial valleys, and have an umbric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is red fir, Sierra lodgepole pine, western white pine, greenleaf manzanita, and various perennial grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are not extensive.
