POLICH SERIES

The Polich series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone, granite, and limestone. Polich soils are on valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Polich silt loam-pastureland on a linear-concave, 1 percent slope at an elevation of 7,910 feet. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A2--5 to 13 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; strongly effervescent; 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the A horizons is 5 to 16 inches.)

    Bw--13 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk2--40 to 48 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; common very fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; slightly effervescent; few very fine masses and concretions of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 10 to 30 inches.)

    2BCkl--48 to 58 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; common very fine and fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations and few very fine manganese concretions; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; few very fine masses and concretions of calcium carbonate; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

    2BCk2--58 to 70 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; few very fine faint yellowish red (5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly, plastic; apparent water table at 58 inches; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). (The combined thickness of the 2BCk horizons is 12 to 18 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION: McKinley County, New Mexico; about 2 miles east of Page, New Mexico; Page Quadrangle; about 1,950 feet north and 200 feet west of the southeast corner of section 34, T.13 N., R.15 W.; 108 degrees 24 minutes 19 seconds west longitude, 35 degrees 18 minutes 40 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: The SMCS is usually moist, in some part, for more than 90 cumulative days from May through October. It is usually dry, in all parts, for less than 90 cumulative days during the same period. It is continuously moist in some part November through April. The period of maximum precipitation is July through August. The soil is driest during May and June. Typic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 42 to 47 degrees F

Particle size control section: 25 to 35 percent clay.

Mollic epipedon: 20 to 45 inches thick

Reaction: Slightly to moderately alkaline

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent.

Depth to water table: 15 to 60 inches; water table is highest during March and April (after snow melt) and during August and September after the summer rains.

Depth to redox concentrations: 20 to 35 inches; few to common, faint to distinct, yellowish red redox concentrations.

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3

Bk horizons:
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam

2BCk horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: clay loam, clay, silty clay loam, or loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Breezebasin (CO), Brycan (UT), Cordeston (WY), Dalmatian (CO), Enbar (MT), Jode (CO), Jodero (CO), McGaffey (NM), Nutrioso (AZ), Pinridge (CO), Staad (MT), and Straw (MT) series. Brycan soils have argillic horizons. Cordeston, Jodero, McGaffey, Nutrioso, Staad, and Straw soils are all well drained. Dalmatian and Enbar soils have gleyed horizons. Additionally, the Cordeston, Jodero, and Straw soils are in LRR-E or LRR-G and are moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Polich soils formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from mixed sources on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 7,600 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40to 45 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cinnadale, Ligocki, Losegate, Owlrock, and Robolata series. The Cinnadale and Owlrock soils are shallow to sandstone and limestone respectively, and are on cuestas and ridges. The Losegate soils are moderately deep to limestone and are on cuestas. The Ligocki and Robolata soils do not have water tables within 60 inches of the surface and are on fan remnants and stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, negligible to low runoff, and moderately slowly permeability. Intermittent water table between 15 and 60 inches. These soils will flood during spring runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for livestock grazing and pasture. The present vegetation is sedges, lovegrass, bluegrass, and iris.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central, New Mexico. MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: McKinley County (Zuni Mountain Area), New Mexico, 1964. The series name is that of a ranch near the original type location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: The zone from the surface to 48 inches. (Al, A2, Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons)

Cumulic feature: Mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick, less than 25 percent slope, and a concave shape.

The type location was moved to the McKinley County Area and the particle-size class was changed from Fine-silty to Fine-loamy in December 2000.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Partial particle size analysis was done by the field survey lab.
