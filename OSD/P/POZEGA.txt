POZEGA SERIES

The Pozega series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium. These soils are on low stream terraces and glacial outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Aquic Calciustepts

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pozega soils are used mainly for pasture, rangeland grazing and as wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, alkali cordgrass and alkali sacaton, with small amounts of Nevada bluegrass, aster and greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Pozega soils are of small extent in Western Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1431. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 5 inches (Az1, and Az2 horizons); a calcic horizon from 22 to 54 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 and Ckg horizons); a lithological discontinuity at 54 inches (2C horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 and Ckg horizons). Pozega soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
