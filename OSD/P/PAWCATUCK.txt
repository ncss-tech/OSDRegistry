SERIES ESTABLISHED: New London County, Connecticut, 1977.

REMARKS: This revision reflects general updating, reformatting, and inclusion of blue carbon data. Pawcatuck soils have been mapped as Tidal marsh, undifferentiated. Some of the Pawcatuck soils were classified and mapped at the Great Group or Subgroup level. Pawcatuck series was originally described as consisting of fibric organic materials. Current procedures for estimating fibers indicate that the materials are dominantly hemic. These soils become extremely acid when drained.

The lab and/or field method for total salts in the Typical Pedon is not known but is retained for historical purposes. Total salt content previously reported in the RIC is generally more than 10,000 ppm, but total salt content ranges from 1,000 to 40,000 ppm.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
1. Histosols--have organic materials that total 40 centimeters or more between the soil surface and a depth of 50 centimeters - the zone from a depth of 0 to 117 centimeters (Oese horizons).
2. Hypersulfidic materials--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters;
3. Reaction (pH value) is more than 4.5 throughout the control section.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Type location taken from 2008CT011008 in Stonington, CT.
