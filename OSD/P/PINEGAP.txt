PINEGAP SERIES

The Pinegap series consists of deep, well-drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum weathered from limestone. They are on hillsides and mountainsides. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Pinegap very gravelly loam, rangeland-47 percent slope on a west/northwest aspect at an elevation of 6,220 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described in November 1984, the profile was moist throughout.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chausse (T) and Sprollow soils.   Chausse soils are less than 40 inches deep to limestone bedrock, and are located on convex upper hillsides.  Sprollow soils have greater than 40 percent calcium carbonate in the control section, and are located on linear hillsides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The important native vegetation is black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, phlox, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008.  The name is taken from a local canyon.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Aand Bw horizons)
Calcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 50 inches  (Bk1, Bk2, and 2Btk)
Lithic contact - 55 inches (2R horizon)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bk1,Bk2, and part of the 2Btk horizons)
The 2Btk horizon does not meet the requirements for an argillic horizon.
