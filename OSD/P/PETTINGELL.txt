PETTINGELL SERIES

The Pettingell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium  and slope alluvium from mixed granite, schist and gneiss rocks. Pettingell soils are on mountain slopes and footslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  loamy-skeletal, micaceous Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pettingell gravelly sandy loam, on a northwestern facing, convex 38 percent slope under Rocky mountain Douglas fir, lodgepole pine and grasses at an elevation of  8755 feet. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.) 

The surface is covered by 1 percent stones, 3 percent cobble and 10 percent gravel.

	A1--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist;  moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; common, visible mica as fine and medium sand sized particles; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble; neutral; clear smooth boundary. ( 1 to 4 inches thick) 

	A2--4 to 11 inches;  brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky parting to moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; common, visible mica as fine and medium sand sized particles; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble and 5 percent stone; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 12 inches thick) 

	Bw--11 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam,  brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few coarse, common very fine roots and few fine roots; common, visible mica as fine and medium sand sized particles; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble and 1 percent stone; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

	BC--18 to 37 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very cobbly coarse sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common, visible mica as fine and medium sand sized particles; 30 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble and 10 percent stone; slightly acid, gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 20 inches thick) 

	C--37 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) extremely stony sandy loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; many, visible mica as fine and medium sand sized particles; 30 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble and 20 percent stone; slightly acid.  (15 to 30 inches thick)
