PUZZLEBARK SERIES

The Puzzlebark series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from tuff and tuff-breccia. Puzzlebark soils are on structural benches. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid, shallow Vitrixerandic Haplodurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Puzzlebark gravelly ashy fine sandy loam--on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 1,367 meters--forest land. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface has a discontinuous layer of undecomposed pine needles.

    Bqkm2--43 to 53 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) cemented material, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate and strong medium and thick platy structure; rigid; very strongly cemented by secondary silica; very few fine and very few medium roots between plates; secondary carbonates segregated as few fine coats on faces of peds; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick) 

    2R--53 cm; basaltic tuff; few coats of opal on upper surface of bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Puzzlebark soils are on structural benches. They formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium derived from basaltic tuff and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,485 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, with an annual snowfall of about 530 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lostforest, Morehouse, and Sandrock soils. Lostforest soils are ashy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have cambic horizons. Morehouse soils are ashy, very deep, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on adjacent dunes. Sandrock soils are ashy, shallow to lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Puzzlebark soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Prior to designation as a Research Natural Area by the Bureau of Land Management, ponderosa pine was commercially harvested in the Lost Forest. The present vegetation is a forest canopy of ponderosa pine and western juniper with an understory of antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, and Sandberg's bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 600 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lake County (Northern Part), Oregon, 2006. The named is coined from the bark of ponderosa pine. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A horizon and part of the Bw horizon). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 36 cm (Bw and Bqk horizons). 
Duripan - The zone from 36 to 53 cm (Bqkm1 and Bqkm2 horizons). 
Lithic contact - The boundary at 53 cm to underlying hard bedrock (2R layer). 
Particle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A, Bw, and Bqk horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Volcanic glass percentages determined locally by optical grain count using a polarizing petrographic microscope. Temperature and precipitation means based on climate data observed at Silver Lake Ranger Station (43 degrees, 7 minutes N, 121 degrees, 4 minutes W; 1,335 meters elevation) between 1953 and 1999.
