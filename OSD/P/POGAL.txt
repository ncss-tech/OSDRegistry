POGAL SERIES

The Pogal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and lacustrine deposits derived from limestone and sandstone.  Pogal soils are on mounds on lake plains.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Box Elder County, Utah; about 9.4 miles west-northwest of Corinne in the state public shooting grounds; approximately 700 feet east and 400 feet north of southwest corner of section 27, T. 10 N., R. 4 W.; USGS Public Shooting Grounds 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 33 minutes 57 seconds north latitude and 112 degrees 17 minutes 30 seconds west longitude, NAD83; UTM zone 12N 392309E, 4602391N, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Typically moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; the soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice; Xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Stingal series.

Stingal soils have electrical conductivities less than 8 mmhos/cm within 40 inches of the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pogal soils are on rounded or elongated mounds on lake plains.  The mounds are about 6 to 20 feet high and have short, abrupt sides.  The soils formed in loess and lacustrine deposits derived mainly from limestone and sandstone.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,250 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eimarsh, Lasil, Pintailake, and Saltair soils.  Eimarsh and Pintailake soils are fine textured and are poorly drained and very poorly drained, respectively.  Lasil soils are fine-silty and have natric horizons.  Saltair soils are fine-silty and have salic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pogal soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Small areas have been leveled and used for nonirrigated cropland.  The vegetation is black greasewood, alkali sacaton, Wyoming big sagebrush, basin wildrye, tall wheatgrass, and annual mustard.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 214-215, Table 9 of the Soil Survey of Box Elder County, Utah, Eastern Part.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from the original field description.
