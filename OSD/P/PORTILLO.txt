PORTILLO SERIES

The Portillo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from granitic sandstone, siltstone, and fanglomerate.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Portillo soils are on backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  They formed in colluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from Tertiary granitic sandstone, siltstone, and fanglomerate.  Slopes are 25 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,900 to 7,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.    The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free  period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Encantado, Junebee, and Pedregal soils.  Encantado soils are sandy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons and calcic horizons, and occur on backslopes of eroded fan remnants generally below Portillo soils.  Junebee soils are coarse-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Pedregal soils are loamy-skeletal, have ochric epipedons, and occur on adjacent narrow beveled summits and  shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high runoff; permeability is slow in the upper part and moderately rapid to rapid  in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Portillo soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, Gamble's oak, oneseed juniper, and twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma/Quercus gambleii/Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB134NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Portillo soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
