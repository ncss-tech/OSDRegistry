COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pharoah soils are on paleoterraces on plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in old clayey alluvium over residuum weathered from shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.9 to 17.2 degrees C. (57 to 63 degrees F.).  Elevation is 160 to 297.2 meters (525 to 975 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dennis, Taloka, Okemah, and Parsons soils.  Dennis soils occur on higher landscape positions and contain a mollic epipedon 25 to 38 cm thick (10 to 15 in).  Taloka soils occur on higher landscapes and have a combined A horizon and E horizon 41 to 102 cm thick (16 to 40 in).  Okemah soils occur on higher landscape positions and do not have an exchangeable sodium percentage of more than 2 in any horizon.  Parsons soils occur on higher landscape positions and contain an abrupt textural change.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 centimeters (6 to 18 inches) during December to May.  Potential for surface runoff is high to very high.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  About half of these soils are in pasture or hay, and the remainder is used to grow crops.  Principal crops are corn, wheat, soybeans, and sorghums.  Native vegetation was tall prairie grasses and scattered hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 84A, 112, 117 and 118 in northern Oklahoma, southeast Kansas and southwest Missouri.  The type location is in MLRA 112.  The series is moderately extensive.
