PIUTESPRING SERIES

The Piutespring series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on backslopes of mountains. Piutespring soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rock with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature about 40 degrees F.
