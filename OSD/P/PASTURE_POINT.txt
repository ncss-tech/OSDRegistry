COMPETING SERIES:  
Cottman soils--are located on lagoon bottom on barrier island side

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain estuaries
Landform: Submerged wave-cut platforms
Parent Material: Sandy Holocene sediments underlain by loamy pre-Holocene sediments
Slope: 0 to 1 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Broadkill soils--are silty and are not permanently submerged; on adjacent tidal marshes
Figgs soils--have N values of less than 1 throughout its profile
Mispillion soils--are not permanently submerged; on adjacent tidal marshes
Tingle soils--are fine silty and have N values of less than 1 throughout its profile
Transquaking soils--are not permanently submerged and have organic surface layers more than 20 inches (51 centimeters) thick; on adjacent tidal marshes
Trappe soils--are sandy throughout; on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Agricultural Drainage Class: Subaqueous (permanently submersed)
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high to moderately low

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Most areas are un-vegetated and function as estuarine benthic habitat. Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish use these areas.
Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima). Vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 5 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and possibly Virginia. This series is of small extent.
