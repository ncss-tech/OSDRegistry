PEOGA SERIES

The Peoga series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy lacustrine or alluvial sediments. They are on lake plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Peoga soils are dominantly on flats of lake plains and to a lesser extent on treads of stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying paleosol from loamy lacustrine sediments, or loess and the underlying alluvial sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1168 mm (38 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 190 days. Elevation is 122 to 244 meters (400 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Dominantly, these are the Dubois, Haubstadt, and Otwell soils on lake plains. The somewhat poorly drained Dubois soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits and shoulders. The moderately well drained Haubstadt soils and the moderately well drained Otwell soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes. To a minor extent, Peoga soils are associated with the Bartle and Pekin soils on stream terraces. The somewhat poorly drained Bartle soils are on slightly higher lying parts of treads. The moderately well drained Pekin soils are on dominantly on gently sloping parts of treads and on risers.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. In undrained areas, the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 feet) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 feet) below the surface between November and June in normal years. In drained areas, the depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high in the upper part of the solum and low to moderately high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for growing cultivated crops, mainly corn and soybeans. Several areas are in forest. A few areas are used to grow wheat, or used for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 114A, 114B, 115A, 120B, 122, 124, and 126 in southern Indiana, southwestern Kentucky, and southern and east-central Ohio. The type location is in MLRA 114A. This series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Morgan County, Indiana, 1937.

REMARKS: Undrained and clayey substratum phases are recognized. The clayey substratum phase will become a new series when the subsets containing it are updated. In 1995, the type location was moved to Scott County to better represent the series concept.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface of the soil to a depth of 48 cm (19 inches) (Ap, BEg horizons).
Argillic horizon: from 48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, Btgx1, Btgx2, 2Btb horizons).
Redoximorphic features: from 0 to 203 cm (80 inches).
