PILEPOINT SERIES

The Pilepoint series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in eolian sand over glacial outwash and dense glaciomarine deposits. Pilepoint soils are on hills of glacial drift plains. Slopes are 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean temperature is about 50 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Argialbolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Pilepoint loam, pasture, on a northwest-facing slope of about 10 percent at 120 feet elevation. When described on October 14, 2003 the soil was moist below 38 inches. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

(7 to 10 inches thick)

 2Cd1--36 to 46 inches, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots in cracks greater than 4 inches apart; prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) iron masses in cracks; few distinct very dark brown (10YR 2/2) organic stains along crack faces; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3). (10 to 20 inches thick) 

 2Cd2--46 to 60 inches, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots in cracks greater than 4 inches apart; few distinct very dark brown (10YR 2/2) organic stains along crack faces; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Tensed series. Tensed soils are very deep, do not have a densic contact, are formed from colluvium mixed with loess, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pilepoint soils are on hills of drift plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. These soils formed in eolian sand over glacial outwash and dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations range from 0 to 300 feet. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. The average annual air temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coveland, Haro, Mitchellbay, and San Juan soils. Coveland soils are in valleys, have a densic contact at 40 to 60 inches and have redoximorphic features at 9 to 20 inches. Haro soils are on adjacent hillsides and have a lithic contact within 20 inches. Mitchellbay soils are also on glacial drift plains but lack a mollic epipedon. San Juan soils are on hill slopes and glacial outwash plains and lack an albic horizon, an argillic horizon, and a densic contact. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid in the upper part (A, Bw and E horizons) and moderately slow to very slow in the lower part (Btg and Cd horizons). 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for pasture, forage crop production, and home sites. Potential natural vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, Oregon white oak, pacific madrone, Roemers fescue, snowberry, bracken fern, trailing blackberry, bald hip rose, and oceanspray. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Washington; MLRA 2, Northern Part. Series is of small extent.
