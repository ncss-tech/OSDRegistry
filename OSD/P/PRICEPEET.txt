PRICEPEET SERIES

The Pricepeet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slide deposits and colluvium derived from mixed igneous and interbedded sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on landslides and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Eutric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Pricepeet gravelly loam, in forest on a 32 percent north slope at an elevation of 2228 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 5 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 cm thick)

   A--5 to 16 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 24 cm thick)

   E--16 to 44 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

   Bt1--44 to 68 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine and  medium, and few coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; 60 percent prominent continuous clay films on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. 

   Bt2--68 to 94 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium, and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 60 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; 30 percent distinct continuous clay films on all faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 45 to 100 cm) 

   BC--94 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; 65 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6).
