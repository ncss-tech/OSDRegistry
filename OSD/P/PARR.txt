PARR SERIES

The Parr series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. The Parr soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loam till. A cap of fine sandy loam sediments is at the surface in some areas. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Parr silt loam, on a 4 percent slope in a hay field at an elevation of 262 meters (860 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. [25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 inches) thick]

 Bt1--25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; few fine pores; few distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; 3 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Bt2--46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common fine pores; few distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 7 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt3--61 to 86 cm (24 to 34 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few roots; few fine pores; common distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 36 to 76 cm (14 to 30 inches).]

 BC--86 to 94 cm (34 to 37 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few faint dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches) thick]

 Cd--94 to 152 cm (37 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; massive; very firm; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Clinton County, Indiana; about 1 mile west and 2 miles south of Frankfort; 200 feet west and 1350 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 17, T. 21 N., R. 2 W.; USGS Frankfort, Ind. topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 15 minutes 41.7 seconds N. and long. 86 degrees 39 minutes 26.2 seconds W., NAD 83; UTM Zone 16, 529142 easting and 4456846 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Depth to densic contact: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam; clay loam is allowed in severely eroded pedons
Rock fragment content: 0 to 4 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: dominantly loam or clay loam, but ranges to silty clay loam in the upper part where the silt cap is at the maximum thickness
Rock fragment content: 0 to 10 percent
Reaction: moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper part, and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part

BC or Cd horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 7
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: commonly loam and less commonly fine sandy loam in the Cd horizon
Rock fragment content: 0 to 14 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and carbonates are present

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corwin, Foresman, Pacer, Prairieville, and Tippecanoe series. Corwin soils have 2 chroma iron depletions within a depth of 76 cm (30 inches). Foresman soils are stratified with textures coarser than sandy loam in the lower part of the series control section. Pacer, Prairieville, and Tippecanoe soils have sola more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parr soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. The soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loam till of Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 13 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Corwin soils, and the Chalmers, Drummer, Octagon, Odell, and Wolcott soils. Corwin soils are on similar to slightly higher lying landscape positions. The poorly drained Chalmers and Drummer soils and the very poorly drained Wolcott soils are in depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Odell soils are on lower lying, less sloping landscape positions. Octagon soils have thinner dark colored epipedons and are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow to very slow in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Largely cropped to corn and soybeans. Small grain and legume hay are also grown. Native vegetation is tall prairie grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Indiana, Illinois, and western Ohio; MLRAs 95B, 108A, 110, 111A, 111B, 111C, and 111D. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of moderate extent.
