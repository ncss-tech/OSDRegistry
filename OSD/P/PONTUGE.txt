PONTUGE SERIES

The Pontuge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and conglomerate material.  Pontuge soils are on terrace sides, hillsides and mountainsides and have slopes of 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cokeville (T), Boundridge (T) and Slan (T) series. The Cokeville series are 40 to 60 inches to weathered sandstone and lack a mollic epipedon. The Boundridge series has a duripan at 14 inches, and has a loamy-skeletal family.  Boundridge soils are on ridgetops and on terrace summits. The Slan series lacks a mollic epipedon and is moderately deep to weathered sandstone.  Slan soils are located on smoother terrace side slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.	 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is dominantly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheat grass, Columbia needlegrass, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Idaho.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 43B.
