PLEMONS SERIES

The Plemons series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy sediments derived from the upper part of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These soils are on gently to strongly sloping valley sides, draws, or broad erosion remnants. The slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (18 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (58 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability. Surface runoff is very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 12 percent slopes.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Primarily used for livestock grazing. Where cultivated, the principal crops are grain sorghum, small grains, and forage crops. Climax vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairieclover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the Limey Upland (R077EY057TX) range site in MLRA-77E.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA-77E in LRR H) of Texas and Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.
