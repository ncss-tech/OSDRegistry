TYPE LOCATION:  Duval County, Florida; about 0.2 mile east of U. S. 1, 0.3 mile south of Greenland Road in NW1/4SE1/4SW1/4, Sec. 7, T. 4 S., R.  28 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 24 inches, February to September or December to May. On typical flatwoods sites the water table is a depth of 6 to 12 inches for 1 to 4 months and at a depth of 12 to 40 inches for 4 months or longer during most years. On higher flatwoods sites, the water table is at 12 to 24 inches for 1 to 4 months and at a depth of 24 to 40 inches for 3 months or longer during most years.
Soil Reaction: extremely acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and E horizon and from extremely acid to moderately acid in the Bh horizon 

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

A horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral (N) with value of 2 to 5
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand or fine sand 

E horizon (upper part):
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand or fine sand 

E horizon (lower part):
Color--hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand or fine sand 
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)-none to common iron masses in shade of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray

EB, BE, E/B horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4 or is neutral (N) with value of 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand 
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)-none to common iron masses in shade of red, yellow, or brown and iron depletions in shades of brown, yellow, olive, or gray
Other features-- Discontinuous lenses or spodic bodies, thinly to moderately coated with colloidal organic matter are in some pedons 

Bh horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4, hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4; and hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4, or is neutral (N) with value of 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand 
Other features-- Sand grains are well coated with organic matter and are weakly cemented in parts. It is massive or has blocky or subangular blocky structure.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Duval County, Florida; 1977.

REMARKS:  This revision changes the series classification to recognize the amendments to Soil Taxonomy that introduces changes in classification of Spodosols.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typifying pedon include:
Ochric epipedon - the zone extending from the surface to a depth of 57 inches (A, E1, E2, and E3 horizons).
Albic horizon - the zone extending from 10 to 57 inches (E2, and E3 horizons).
Spodic horizon - the zone extending from 57 to 80 inches (Bh horizon).
Aquic condition - endosaturation throughout in most pedons.
