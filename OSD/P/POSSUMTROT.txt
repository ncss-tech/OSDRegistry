POSSUMTROT SERIES

The Possumtrot series consists of very deep, well drained soils on low stream terraces and flood plains. These soils formed in loamy stream alluvium. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, superactive, mesic Fluventic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Possumtrot fine sandy loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes, occasionally flooded, in a fescue pasture at an elevation of 980 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 9 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (thickness of the Ap horizon is 7 to 12 inches)

   Bw1--9 to 22 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.

   Bw2--22 to 31 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; many fine pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.

   Bw3--31 to 40 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many fine pores; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 23 to 60 inches)

   2C1--40 to 45 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand; massive; friable; many fine pores; 70 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

   2C2--45 to 58 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) gravelly loamy sand; massive; friable; many fine pores; 25 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

   2C3--58 to 80 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; many fine pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0). (combined thickness of the 2C horizons is 0 to 30 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  Series in similar families are the Gladden, Kaintuck and Pope series.  Gladden soils have a lighter color surface layer and higher base saturation.  Kaintuck soils are stratified below the surface horizon.  Pope soils have mixed mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Possumtrot soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces. They formed in loamy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Kaintuck and Pope soils and the Bender, Lily, Midco, and Razort series. Kaintuck and Pope soils are on similar positions. Bender and Lily soils are moderately deep and are on uplands. Bender soils are loamy-skeletal and Lily soils are fine-loamy. Midco soils are loamy-skeletal and are on flood plains. Razort soils are fine-loamy and are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is negligable to low. Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for pasture and hayland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks region (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of south central Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. The series is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Osage County, Missouri, 1996.

REMARKS: This series was originally classified as an Umbric Dystrochrept, and was changed to the current classification based on the 1998 edition of the Keys to Taxonomy.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

1)  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches. (Ap
    horizon)
2)  Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 40 inches.(Bw horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA: This soil is being mapped in the Roubidoux and Gasconade geologic formations in Missouri.
