PRESTO SERIES

The Presto series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Presto loamy sand, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--8 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk1 --20 to 43 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2--43 to 71 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    2Bk3--71 to 86 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent threadlike calcium carbonate masses and 2 percent irregular calcium carbonate masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    2Bk4--86 to 127 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent threadlike calcium carbonate masses and irregular masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    2Bk5--127 to 150 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent threadlike calcium carbonate masses and 2 percent irregular calcium carbonate masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)
