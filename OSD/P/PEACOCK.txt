PEACOCK SERIES

The Peacock series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist, metasedimentary rocks, and sandstone. Peacock soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peacock soils occur on broad ridges and upper slopes of mountains. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 28 to 805 meters (90 to 2640 feet). The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist and sandstone. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2030 to 2550 millimeters (80 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rockysaddle and the Wiregrass soils. Rockysaddle and Wiregrass soils are 10YR to 7.5YR throughout and, Rockysaddle soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and Wiregrass soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. The Rockysaddle and Wiregrass soils are in broad hollows and on steeper slopes below the Peacock soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; moderately low to low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber and is used for recreation, wildlife and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of Douglas fir, red alder, redwood, tanoak, huckleberry, and Pacific rhododendron.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt Del Norte area, California 2012. Source of name is from Peacock Creek, a tributary of the Smith River in Del Norte County.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 22 centimeters (A1 & A2 horizons)
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 200 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5 & BCt horizons)
3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of 20 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon
4. Palehumult features - Clay remains at least 93 percent of its maximum to a depth of 200 centimeters
5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 22 to 72 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3), averages 41 percent clay, by weight, and 12 percent rock fragments, by volume.
5. Parasesquic mineralogy - There is 24 percent dithionite-extractible sesquioxides in the clay fraction of the particle size control section.

ADDITIONAL DATA: A similar soil, the Trailhead series type pedon is field sample number S83-CA-12-01, analyzed at Oregon State University and at NSSL. Backup samples S83-CA-12-02 and S83-CA-12-03 were analyzed for mineralogy class at NSSL. University of California samples 60-CA-12-17X and 60-CA-12-18X was collected for the Soil-Vegetation Survey in Redwood National Park.
