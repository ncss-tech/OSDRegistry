SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Thermic region of Piedmont in the Triassic Basin of North Carolina and possibly Virginia
Extent: Small

SERIES PROPOSED: Montgomery County, North Carolina, 2000

REMARKS: Peakin soils were previously mapped as Mayodan soils. Mayodan soils do not have iron depletions within 60 inches of the surface.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 61 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Reference particle-size data is available from the project soil survey staff, Troy, North Carolina.
