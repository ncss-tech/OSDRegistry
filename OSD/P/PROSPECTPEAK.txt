COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Prospectpeak soils are on shield volcanoes in the Southern Cascade mountains. Slopes are 10 to 30 percent. These soils formed in tephra from Cinder Cone over tephra from Chaos Crags mixed with residuum from andesite. Elevation is 6445 to 7990 feet (1965 to 2436 m). Mean annual precipitation is 31 to 43 inches (787 to 1092 mm). The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F (6 degrees C). Frost free season is 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearrubble, Buttelake and Badgerflat soils. The Bearrubble soils are very deep and have more stones and boulders at the surface and in the upper profile due to a thinner mantle of tephra on the surface. The Buttelake soils are deep to dense till and are on moraines that are covered with a mantle of tephra from Cinder Cone. The Badgerflat soils are moderately deep to dense till and are on moraines with a mantle of tephra from Chaos Crags.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the A horizon, very high in the C and 2Ab horizons, high in the upper 2Bwb horizon and high to very high in the lower 2Bwb horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat, recreation, ecosystem management and watershed. Vegetation is California red fir, Jeffrey pine, pinemat manzanita and bush chinquapin.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 22B  Southern Cascade mountains
