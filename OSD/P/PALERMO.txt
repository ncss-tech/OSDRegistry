PALERMO SERIES

The Palermo series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in thick loess. These soils are on strongly dissected loess hills and bluffs bordering the Missouri River Valley and its tributaries. Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 91 centimeters (36 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Palermo silty clay loam is on a 7 percent convex slope.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak very fine granular structure; friable; many roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) thick) 

  Bt1--13 to 28 centimeters (5 to 11 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many roots; few distinct continuous clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) thick)

  Bt2--28 to 58 centimeters (11 to 23 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many roots; few distinct continuous clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (43 to 86 centimeters (17 to 34 inches) thick)

  Bt3--58 to 104 centimeters (23 to 41 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few distinct discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; few fine irregular strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation throughout and few fine irregular black (N 2/0) masses of iron-manganese accumulation throughout; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 79 to 145 centimeters (31 to 57 inches) thick) 

  C--104 to 203 centimeters (41 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; massive; friable; few fine irregular strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation throughout and few fine irregular black (N 2/0) masses of iron-manganese accumulation throughout; neutral.

Some pedons contain redoximorphic features with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4-6, are within the range of the series. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bertrand, Blackhammer, Camden, Dodge, Dubuque, Fayette, Flagg, Greenridge, Hackers, Jackson, Jemerson, Knowles, LaFarge, Lambeau, Lomira, Martensburg, Menfro, Middletown, Navlys, Palsgrove, Pepin,
Piscasaw, Ridgway, Rozetta, Ruma, Rush, Russell, Seaton, St, Charles, Stookey, Sylvan, Thebes and Yellowriver series. 
Dubuque, Knowles, and Palsgrove soils have lithic contact within 60 inches.
Bertrand, Blackhammer, Camden, Dodge, Flagg, Jackson, Lomira, Ridgeway, Rush, Russell and Thebes soils have a lithological discountinuity with material that contains more the 15 percent sand.  
Fayette, Martinsburg, Menfro, Piscasaw, Rozetta, Ruma, Seaton, St. Charles, Stookey, Sylvan and Yellowriver have an E horizon.
Greenridge and Lambeau soils allow a paralithic contact at 45 inches. 
Hacker soils have redder hue in the series control section.
Jemerson soils formed in alluvium and/or loess on high floodplains. 
LaFarge and Marseilles soils have paralithic contact within 40 inches. 
Middletown has loamy sand at 40 inches.
Navyls soils are in cooler temperature and lessor precipitation regimes.
Pepin soils have clayey pedisediment at 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: strongly dissected hills and bluffs bordering the Missouri River Valley and its tributaries
Slope: 7 to 27 percent but range to 35 percent
Parent material: thick loess
Mean annual temperature: 12 to 13 degrees C. (53 to 55 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 91 to 97 centimeters (36 to 38 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Marshall and Ladoga soils.  
Marshall and Ladoga soils contain mollic colors in the A horizon, and occur on ridges and slopes farther back from the river bluffs.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: medium to rapid
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high or high. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are cropped to corn and soybeans.  
Some of the steeper slopes are used for hay and pasture.  
Native vegetation is hardwood trees and prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Kansas.  (MLRA 107 - Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills)

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Doniphan County, Kansas, 1997. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this series are: 
ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: 13 to 104 centimeters (5 to 41 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
The redoximorphic features that occur in some pedons are not indicative of the current drainage conditions.  

Modified format by LRM in 7/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
