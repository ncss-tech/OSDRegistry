PARISA SERIES

The Parisa series consists of moderately deep over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  The Parisa soils are on fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Xeric Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Parisa gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 35 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Bk--10 to 41 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots, few coarse; common very fine tubular pores; thin carbonate coatings on underside of coarse fragments; 35 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 50 cm thick)

    Bqk--41 to 66 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard to hard, friable to brittle, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine through medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; weak discontinuous carbonate and silica cementation; thin to moderately thick carbonate coatings on undersides of coarse fragments; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (18 to 50 cm thick)

    2Bqkm--66 to 119 cm; indurated duripan with a continuous 1 to 2mm thick laminar cap; massive to coarse platy structure; 70 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; clear wavy boundary.  (46 to 76 cm thick)

    2Bqk--119 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; weak discontinuous carbonate and silica cementation; thin carbonate coatings on tops and sides and moderately thick on bottoms of coarse fragments; 60 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, dominantly gravel.

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.

Chroma: 2 through 4.
Consistence: Slightly hard to hard dry, very friable to friable moist.
Silica cementation: 20 percent discontinuous weak to continuous weak silica cementation.
Other features: Some pedons have thin strata of non-cemented very gravelly sandy loam, and/or thin strata of strong silica cementation.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parisa soils are on off shore bars and summits of fan piedmont remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,590 to 1,140 meters. The climate is cool, semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Debab, Palinor and Shabliss series. Debab soils have argillic horizons and fine loamy. Palinor and Shabliss soils are shallow to the duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East Central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  White Pine County, Nevada, West Part, 1990.

REMARKS:  The name is coined from the nearby Paris Ranch. The Type Location was moved to better reflect series concepts.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 18 cm (A and part of Bk horizons).
Indurated duripan - The zone from about 66 to 119 cm (2Bqkm horizon).
Xeric feature - Meets the organic carbon requirement for Xeric.
Particle-size control section - The zone from a depth of about 25 cm to 66 cm (part of the Bk and Bqk horizons).
