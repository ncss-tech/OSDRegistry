PUUONE SERIES

The Puuone series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material derived from coral seashells. Puuone soils are on sand hills and have slopes of 7 to 30 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Carbonatic, isohyperthermic Typic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Puuone sand - pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

     C1--0 to 20 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grained; loose; many fine roots; porous; violent effervescence with hydrochloric acid; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (20 to 40 inches thick)

     C2cam--20 to 40 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) cemented sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; very hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots in cracks; breaks down under treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid but not with water; violent effervescence with hydrochloric acid; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

TYPE LOCATION:  Island of Maui, Maui County, Hawaii; Wailuku Quadrangle - 20 degrees 54' 40" north latitude and 156 degrees 29' 30" west longitude; 150 feet southwest of Waiehu Beach Road and 1.6 miles from the Main Street intersection near the community of Paukukalo.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the cemented horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 75 degrees F.  It is common to fine old root channels filled With a hard white material that effervesce violently with dilute hydrochloric acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Jaucas series.  Jaucas soils are uniform sand without cementation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Puuone soils are on sand hills.  Slope is 7 to 30 percent.  Exposure of the cemented horizon at the surface is common on moderately steep slopes and ridgetops.  Elevation ranges from 50 to 350 feet.  The soils formed in wind-deposited sand from coral and seashells.   Annual rainfall is 20 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.; average January temperature is 72 degrees F.; average July temperature is 78 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Iao soils and the competing Jaucas soils.  Iao soils have a fine-textured control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability above the cemented horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for pasture and urban development.  The natural vegetation is bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), kiawe (Prosopis pallida), koa-haole (Leucaena glauca) and lantana (Lantana camara).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Island of Maui, Maui County, Hawaii.  This series is approximately 4,600 acres in extent.
