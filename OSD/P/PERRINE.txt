2R horizon: weakly to strongly cemented porous rippable oolitic limestone.  
Solution holes several inches to several feet in width, and up to 1 meter in depth can occur. They are filled with sand, silt loam, or soft carbonatic material.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lignumvitae and Pennsuco series. 
Lignumvitae soils: have limestone bedrock at similar soil depths of less than 100 centimeters but are subjected to flooding by tides, storm surges, and hurricanes, and occur in low broad tidal flats.
Pennsuco soils: have bedrock at depths greater than 100 centimeters and are on similar landform positions.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: calcareous freshwater silty marl deposits over oolithic limestone bedrock
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): freshwater marshes, swamps, and low broad coastal flats on marine terraces
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 27 degrees C (73 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1570 millimeters (37 to 62 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Dade and Pennsuco soils.
Dade soils have a sandy particle-sized control section, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, have bedrock at depths less than 100 centimeters, are better drained, and occur on slightly higher landform positions.
Pennsuco soils have bedrock at depths greater than 102 centimeters (40 inches) and are on similar landform positions.
