COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Borda, Campo, Gooding, Mahala, Sorf, Twickenham and Verdico series.

Mahala, Sorf and Verdico soils have paralithic contacts within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Borda soils have lithic contacts within 150 cm of the soil surface. Gooding soils have duripans within 150 cm of the soil surface and lithic contacts within 200 cm of the soil surface. Campo soils do not possess an albic horizon. Twickenham soils formed in colluvium and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments below the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Phing soils are on fan remnants and terraces.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,500 to 2,000 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chalco, Buffaran, Pung, Zephan, Boondock, Springmeyer and Reno soils. Chalco soils are shallow to paralithic contacts and are formed in pedisediment or colluvium over residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Buffaran soils are shallow to duripans. Pung soils have mollic epipedons. Zephan soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and have lithic contacts within 150 cm of the soil surface. Boondock soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks and are shallow to paralithic contacts. Springmeyer soils have mollic epipedons. Reno soils have duripans within 100 cm of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Phing soils are used for wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush and Thurber's needlegrass. Single leaf pinyon and Utah juniper may be present. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
