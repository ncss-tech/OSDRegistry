SERIES ESTABLISHED: Queen Anne's County, MD, 1995.

REMARKS: Pineyneck soils were previously mapped as the Woodstown series. It is distinguished from Woodstown by having a particle size control section that is coarse-loamy rather than fine-loamy
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 36 centimeters (0 to 14 inches) (Ap and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 36 to 69 centimeters (14 to 27 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions with a value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less with concentrations in the upper 60 centimeters (24 inches) of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 152 centimeters (0 to 60 inches)
