MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, North Carolina; 1979.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in the typical pedon are:
Histic epipedon -the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches
Cambic horizon -the zone between 26 and 36 inches (Bg2 horizon)
Aquic soil conditions -indicated by the presence of dominant colors in shades of gray that are iron depletions (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and 2Cg horizons)
