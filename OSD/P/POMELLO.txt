POMELLO SERIES

The Pomello series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy marine sediments.  Pomello soils are on ridges, hills, and knolls in the flatwoods on marine terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Oxyaquic Alorthods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pomello fine sand--rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil).

    A--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [3 to 15 centimeters (1 to 6 inches) thick]

    E--10 to 107 centimeters (4 to 42 inches); white (10YR 8/1) fine sand; single grain; loose; common fine and medium roots; few coarse roots; few strata of dark gray in root channels; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  [66 to 142 centimeters (26 to 56 inches) thick]

    Bh1--107 to 119 centimeters (42 to 47 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) black (5YR 2/1), and dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) fine sand; weakly cemented; massive; friable; common fine and medium roots; sand grains are located with organic matter; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

[Combined thickness of the Bh horizon ranges from 15 to 89 centimeters (6 to 35 inches)]

    Bw--137 to 168 centimeters (54 to 66 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) fine sand; common medium faint dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) masses of dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic matter bodies; single grain; loose; very strongly acid.  [0 to 76 centimeters thick (0 to 30 inches) thick)]

    Cg--168 to 203 centimeters (66 to 80 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) sand; single grain, loose; very strongly acid.
