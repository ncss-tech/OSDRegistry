COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains and outwash plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly outwash
Elevation: 2,667 to 3,812 feet (813 to 1,162 m)
Slope: 6 to 65 percent
Annual precipitation: 31 to 37 inches (776 to 940 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Basaltlake and Castnot soils. Basaltlake and Castnot soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the upper part of the solum and high to very high in the lower part of the profiles.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is shrub birch-dwarf ericaceous scrub mosaic.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
