POTTER SERIES

The Potter series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvium from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. Potter soils are on very gently sloping to steep draws, escarpments, or valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 150 to 225 days, cumulative, in normal years. The soil is intermittently moist April through September. October through March are the driest months. As a result of very high runoff the soil moisture control section is dry for longer periods than normal for the climate zone. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 16 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F). 
Depth to calcic horizon: 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in). 
Solum thickness: greater than 203 cm (80 in). 
Particle-size control section: 15 to 26 percent silicate clay, and averages more than 35 percent coarse fragments. 

A horizons: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4

Bkk horizon:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Kimberson, Kimbrough, Tascosa, and Yellowhouse series and the Berda, Mansker, Mobeetie, Tulia, and Veal series. 
Berda and Mobeetie soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and do not have over 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. 
Kimberson and Kimbrough soils: are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains. 
Mansker and Tulia: soils are on higher landscape positions and have an argillic horizon. 
Tascosa soils: are on similar landscape positions. 
Veal soils: are on similar landscape positions and does not have over 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. 
Yellowhouse soils: are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately slow permeability. Runoff is moderate on 1 to 5 percent slopes and high on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and very high on slopes of more than 20 percent. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used entirely for livestock grazing. Vegetation is dominantly sideoats grama, little bluestem, hairy grama, blue grama, slim tridens, sand dropseed, and perennial threeawn. A few woody species such as catclaw, yucca, feather dalea, skunkbush, juniper, hackberry, and mesquite occur. This soil has been correlated to the Very Shallow (R-077EY068TX) range site in MLRA-77E. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E of LRR H) of western Texas, eastern New Mexico, and northwestern Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Potter County, Texas; 1929. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm. (A horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in). (Bk, BCkk horizons). 
Plugged (kk) horizon: 38 to 203 cm (15 to 80 in). (BCkk horizons) 
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.
