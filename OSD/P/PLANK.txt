PLANK SERIES

The Plank series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid-Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in)..

Additional Comments: The classification was changed in April 2000 from Typic Vermaqualfs to Natric Vermaqualfs due to lab data from the series type location from Hardin County, Texas.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number (S94TX-199-005) from series type location in Hardin County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory data on samples (S94TX-199-005) and Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Lab on samples from the series type location in Hardin County, Texas.
