 A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate and silica coatings less than 2 mm thick on bottom of rock fragments; slightly effervescent (60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary

 Bkq1--8 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate and silica coatings less than 2 mm thick on bottom of rock fragments; strongly effervescent (50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary

 Bkq2--18 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate and silica coatings less than 3 mm thick on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent (70 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary
