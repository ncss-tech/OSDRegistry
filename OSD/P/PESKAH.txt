PESKAH SERIES


The Peskah series consists of deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Peskah soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peskah soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 4,600 feet. The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is degrees 57 to 63 F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 270 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo and Crosgrain soils. Arizo and Crosgrain soils lack an argillic horizon. Arizo soils has a sandy-skeletal control section. Crosgrain soils are shallow to a duripan. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low or medium runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly big galleta, white bursage, creosotebush, range ratany, ephedra, spiny hopsage and winterfat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
