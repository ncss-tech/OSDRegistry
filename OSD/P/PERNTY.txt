PERNTY SERIES

The Pernty series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic or metamorphic rocks.  Pernty soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pernty very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 20 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and few coarse roots; common very fine tubular and few very fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--20 to 36 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium, few coarse roots; common very fine tubular and few very fine interstitial pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    R--36 cm; chert.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; about 18 miles south of Battle Mountain in the Shoshone Range; approximately 725 feet north and 2,600 feet west of the southeast corner of section 10, T. 29 N., R. 45 E.; USGS Crippen Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 23 minutes 32 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 53 minutes 50 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.3922222 latitude, -116.8980556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in some part from late October through early June, dry for 90 to 120 consecutive days; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 5 to 8 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 25 cm; includes the Bt1 horizon.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 36 to 50 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm to a lithic contact.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 25 to 35 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 50 percent, mainly gravel or cobbles.  Lithology of fragments is volcanic rocks such as rhyolite or metamorphic rocks such as chert.

A horizon 
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Organic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.

Bt1 horizon
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture:   Loam or clay loam. 
Modifiers: Very gravelly, very cobbly or cobbly.
Structure:  Weak or moderate subangular blocky.
Organic matter content: 1 or 2 percent.

Bt2 horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture:   Loam or clay loam. 
Modifiers: Very gravelly, very cobbly or cobbly.
Structure:  Weak or moderate subangular blocky or is massive.
Other features:  Some pedons in Utah have texture of extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anaud, Cleavage, Cleavmor, Cropper, Gaciba, Granquin, Grosschat, Horsetrack, Mascamp, Shalper, Slatter, and Tractuff series.

Anaud, Granquin, and Tractuff soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.   Cleavage, Cropper, Grosschat, and Mascamp soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Cleavmor soils have mollic epipedons that are 36 to 50 cm thick.  Gaciba soils have 16 to 24 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Horsetrack and Shalper soils have lithic contacts shallower than 36 cm.  Slatter soils are very shallow and have 18 to 25 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pernty soils are on mountains, hills and lava plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as rhyolite, welded tuff, and basalt or metamorphic rocks such as chert.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,625 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golsum, Gosumi, and Sumine soils.  Golsum soils are clayey-skeletal and moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Gosumi soils are clayey-skeletal and deep to lithic contacts.  Sumine soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pernty soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, juniper, Idaho fescue, phlox, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada, southern Oregon, and western Utah.  These soils are extensive with about 106,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  The original series concept is in MLRA 24, but more acreage occurs in MLRAs 23, 25, 26 and 47.
