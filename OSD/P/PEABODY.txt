PEABODY SERIES

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, active, mesic Ultic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Peabody silty clay loam on a 40 percent northeast facing slope under mixed hardwoods at an elevation of 421 meters (1380 feet).  (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise indicated.)

 Oi--0 to 3 cm (0 to 1 inch); slightly decomposed organic material.

 A--3 to 8 cm (1 to 3 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable, slightly sticky, non-plastic; many very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 inches) thick)

 Bt1--8 to 28 cm (3 to 11 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--28 to 58 cm (11 to 23 inches); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) silty clay; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 30 to 97 cm (12 to 38 inches))

 C--58 to 71 cm (23 to 28 inches); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) parachannery silty clay; massive; firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 30 percent shale and siltstone fragments; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) thick)

 Cr--71 cm (28 inches); weathered red clay shale and siltstone.
