PINEVILLAGE SERIES

The Pinevillage series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial fans and flood plains. They formed in gravelly and very gravelly loamy and sandy alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Pinevillage gravelly sandy loam, on a 5 percent slope in a wooded area at an elevation of about 162 meters (530 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable; common fine roots; 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 C1--20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine roots; 20 percent gravel; 10 percent cobbles; 2 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary [8 to 38 cm (3 to 15 inches) thick]

 C2--61 to 114 cm (24 to 45 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine roots; 30 percent gravel; 10 percent cobbles; 5 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [41 to 64 cm (16 to 25 inches) thick]

 C3--114 to 140 cm (45 to 55 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine roots; 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 51 cm (20 inches) thick]

 C4--140 to 152 cm (55 to 60 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; 20 percent gravel; 8 percent cobbles; 3 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Tippecanoe County, Indiana; 4 miles south of Montmorenci; 1,600 feet west and 910 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 24, T. 23 N., R. 6 W.; USGS Otterbein, Indiana topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 25 minutes 7.6 seconds N. and 87 degrees 2 minutes 46.6 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 496073 easting and 4474243 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Particle-size control section: averages between 30 and 50 percent gravel, 3 and 15 percent cobbles, and 0 and 5 percent stones
Series control section: reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout; all horizons are calcareous

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: gravelly silt loam or gravelly sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 15 to 30 percent gravel

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam; below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) gravelly loamy coarse sand or gravelly loamy sand are included
Rock fragment content: 15 to 65 percent gravel; subhorizons with less than 15 percent gravel are present in some pedons

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in closely related families are the Beavercreek and Elsah series. Beavercreek and Elsah soils do not have carbonates in all parts of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinevillage soils are on alluvial fans, narrow flood plains, and structural benches below landforms thought to be of Wisconsinan age. These soils are dominantly on high-lying alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Pinevillage soils formed in gravelly and very gravelly loamy and sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rodman, Strawn, and Tice soils. Both the excessively drained Rodman soils and the well drained Strawn soils are on adjacent terraces and upland side slopes. Rodman soils have less clay and Strawn soils have less rock fragments in the series control section. The somewhat poorly drained Tice soils are on lower lying flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid. Flash flooding is a hazard following high intensity rainfall. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, or small grain. Some areas are in woodland. A few areas are used for hayland or pasture. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111C and 111D in west-central Indiana. The series is of small extent.
