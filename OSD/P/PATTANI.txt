PATTANI SERIES

The Pattani series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff.  The Pattani soils are on hills and rock pediments.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Leptic Haploxererts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pattani clay, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 cm thick)

     AB--3 to 25 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; upper part has moderate medium granular and moderate thin platy structure to depth of about 13 cm, the lower part is massive; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual irregular boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

     Bss--25 to 38 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and medium roots; common very fine cracks; common oblique slickensides; noneffervescent upper part but slightly effervescent in lower part; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 33 cm thick)

     Bk--38 to 51 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and medium roots; common very fine cracks; 5 to 10 percent angular decomposing light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) tuff fragments, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; common faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) pressure faces; strongly effervescent on tuff fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 50 cm thick)

    Cr--51 to 58 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry and moist; weathered tuff bedrock; massive; very hard and extremely hard, very firm and extremely firm; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; about 14 miles north of Carlin; about 2,000 feet south and 2,500 feet west of the northeast corner section 4, T. 34 N., R. 52 E.; USGS Schroeder Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 51 minutes 54 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 7 minutes 57 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.8650000 latitude, -116.1325000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist winter and spring, dry June through October; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to carbonates: 30 to 50 cm.
Other features:  The soil has cracks that close when the soil becomes moist in the late October and opens when the soil becomes dry in early June.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 55 percent.

A horizon 
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  5 or 6 moist or dry.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

B and Bk horizons
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Clay, silty clay, or clay loam.
Structure:  Angular blocky, subangular blocky or it is massive.
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 5 percent, increasing with depth
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Other features:  Common to many slickensides, has cracks in the dry season that extend to the surface and range up to 5 cm in width.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pattani soils are on hills and rock pediments.  These soils formed in residuum derived from tuff.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,130 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pie Creek and Susie Creek soils.  Both have Mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly basin wildrye, bottlebrush squirreltail, cheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, rubber rabbitbrush, and Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  MLRA 25.  These soils are not extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A and part of the AB horizons).
Paralithic contact - The boundary at 51 cm (Cr layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone 25 to 51 cm (B, and Bk horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: The location was adjusted in 5/2009 update to fit within a delineation of Pattani clay.
