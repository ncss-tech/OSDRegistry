PIE CREEK SERIES

The Pie Creek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff.  Pie Creek soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Palexerolls

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pie Creek soils are on low hills and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum derived from tuff.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,520 to 2,130 meters.  The average annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, the average annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chen, Pattani, Ramires, Susie Creek, Taylor Creek and Toeja soils.  

Chen soils have bedrock with a depth of 50 cm.  Pattani soils lack argillic horizons.  Ramires and Susie Creek soils lack an E horizon, and are fine in the particle-size control section.  Taylor Creek soils have cryic soil temperatures and lack an E horizon and bedrock within depth of 100 cm.  Toeja soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally low sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Thurber needlegrass and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern and North-Central Nevada.  MLRA 25.  These soils are moderately extensive.
