PANNFIELD SERIES

The Pannfield series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from tuff.  Pannfield soils are on scarps on dissected pediments.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pannfield ashy sandy loam, on a 4 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 2835 meters (9,300 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on November 16, 1993.

	A2--10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) ashy sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons: 18 to 25 cm)

	Bk1--20 to 38 cm (8 to 15 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very paragravelly ashy sandy clay loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium carbonate masses in the matrix; 3 percent gravel; 55 percent moderately cemented tuff paragravel; slightly effervescent; 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

	Bk2--38 to 56 cm (15 to 22 inches); pale yellow (5Y 8/2) very paragravelly ashy sandy clay loam, pale olive (5Y 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium carbonate masses on bottom of rock fragments and in the matrix; 2 percent gravel; 55 percent moderately cemented tuff paragravel; strongly effervescent; 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

	Bk3--56 to 89 cm (22 to 35 inches); pale yellow (5Y 8/2) very paragravelly ashy sandy clay loam, pale olive (5Y 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium carbonate masses in the matrix; 2 percent gravel; 55 percent moderately cemented tuff paragravel; slightly effervescent; 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bk horizons: 51 to 84 cm)

	Cr--89 to 152 cm (35 to 60 inches); pale yellow (5Y 8/2) moderately cemented tuff.
