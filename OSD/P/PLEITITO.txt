PLEITITO SERIES

The Pleitito series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and/or granitoid rock. Pleitito soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains. Slope is 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 229 mm (9 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pleitito soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains. Slope is 1 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and/or granitoid rock. Elevations are 142 to 887 meters (465 to 2,910 feet). The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 178 to 254 mm (7 to 10 in). The mean annual temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C. (61 to 65 degrees F). Mean July temperature is about 29 degrees C (85 degrees F.), and mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cerini, Excelsior, Guijarral, Laval, and Tupman soils. Cerini soils, on alluvial fans, have a fine-loamy particle-size class. Excelsior soils, on alluvial fans and bars and channels on flood plains, have an aridic soil moisture regime. Guijarral soils, on fan remnants, have a cambic horizon and an aridic soil moisture regime. Laval soils, on alluvial fans and/or flood plains, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size class. Tupman soils, on fan remnants and stream terraces, have a cambic horizon and an aridic soil moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are subject to brief, frequent flooding from January to April.

USE AND VEGETATION: Pleitito soils are used for livestock grazing. Native vegetation is allscale saltbush, rabbitbush, red brome and redstem filaree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the Southern San Joaquin Valley of California, MLRA 17. The series is not extensive.
