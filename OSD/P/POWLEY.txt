COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Powley soils are on fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff and basalt and in eolian material derived from volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 5,500 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches that comes mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Espil, Hart Camp, and Mascamp soils.   Espil soils are shallow to duripans.  Hart Camp soils are shallow to paralithic contacts.  Mascamp soils are loamy-skeletal and are shallow to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; very slow permeability above the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Powley soils are used for livestock grazing.  The dominant vegetation consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and annual forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and adjacent parts of northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Washoe County (Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area), Nevada, 1968. 

REMARKS:  This series was inactivated in 2007 as a result of the update and recorrelation of the Soil Survey of Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California and Nevada in 2006.

The revision of May 2001 updated the type location to the probable correct location of the typical pedon.  A prior revision in March 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Aridic Durixerolls and recognized the influence of volcanic ash on the upper horizons.


Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 11 inches (A1, A2, A3, and Bt and E horizons).

Argillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Bt and E, Bt, and Btq horizons).

Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 11 inches (A1, A2, A3, and Bt and E horizons).

Durinodes - The zone from 15 to 19 inches (Btq horizon).

Duripan - The zone from 19 to 32 inches (Bqm and Bqkm horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 19 inches (Bt and E, Bt, and Btq horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon is sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S88NV-031-001 (pedon # 88P0686).
