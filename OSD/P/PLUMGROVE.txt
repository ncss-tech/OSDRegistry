DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is high. The soil is saturated above argillic horizon for long periods during the months of December to April in normal years and endosaturation from 91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 in) in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for timber production and wildlife habitat. The main trees are loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, longleaf pine, water oak, willow oak, southern red oak, and sweetgum.  Understory includes yaupon, southern bayberry, pinehill bluestem, longleaf uniola, and sedges.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Generally west of the Trinity River in southeast Texas. Land Resource Region- T; Major Land Resource Area- Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B) The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Liberty County, Texas; 2012. 

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Kirbyville and Splendora series. The series was separated based on the particle-size family.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 71 to 121 cm (28 to 78 in). (Bt/E1 and Bt/E2 horizons) 

ochric epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in). (Ap and horizons) 
glossic and argillic horizon: 71 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in). (Bt/E1, Bt/E2/Btg/E horizons)

Additional Comments: These soils do not have aquic conditions in the upper part during normal years.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S12TX2911034 from Liberty County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data from type location S12TX2911034 from Liberty County, Texas.
