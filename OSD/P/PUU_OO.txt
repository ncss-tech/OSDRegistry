PUU OO SERIES

The Puu Oo series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash. Puu Oo soils are in ash fields on upper elevation, windward slopes of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa volcanoes.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2540 millimeters (100 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over hydrous, ferrihydritic, isomesic Acrudoxic Hydrudands

TYPICAL PEDON: Puu Oo medial silt loam, on an east facing 5 percent slope under pasture and an elevation of 1,871 meters (6140 feet). (Colors are for moist, crushed, soil unless otherwise noted)

    2Bw3--41 to 56 centimeters (16 to 22 inches ); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) hydrous silty clay loam; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) crushed, dry; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, soft,  slightly plastic and strongly smeary; common roots; many fine pores; 10 percent subangular gravel sized, gibbsite nodules; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    2Bw4-- 56 to 69 centimeters (22 to 27 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) hydrous sandy clay loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) crushed, dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable, soft, sticky, plastic and strongly smeary; common roots; many fine pores; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the 2Bw horizon is 46 to 64 centimeters (18 to 25 inches thick))

    3Cr--69 to 127 centimeters (27 to 50 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) hydrous very fine sandy clay loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) crushed, dry; massive; extremely firm, very hard, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; few roots; many fine pores; strongly acid (pH 5.3). (thickness of the 3Cr horizon is 50 to 75 centimeters (20 to 30 inches thick))

    4R--127 centimeters (50 inches); highly weathered basalt

TYPE LOCATION: Island of Hawaii; from Keanakolu road (Mana Road) at Waipahoehoe gulch; hike approximately 1.2 miles due east following the north side of the gulch.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Puu Oo soils are soils are in ash fields that are on the upper-elevation windward slopes of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations of 1372 to 1981 meters (4,500 to 6,500 feet). Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in recent volcanic ash.Mean annual rainfall is 1270 to 3302 millimeters (50 to 130 inches). Mean annual soil temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: On Mauna Kea volcano, these are the Kau, Keamoku, Laumaia, Kaiwiki, and Waiakea soil series.  Kau, Keamoku, and Waiakea soils all have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Laumaia soils have cementation in 75 percent or more of the pedon.  Kaiwiki soils are on elevations of less than 1615 meters (5300 feet).
On Mauna Loa volcano, these are Puali, Pahipa, and Kaholimo.  Puali and Kaholimo soils are less than 50 centimeters (20 inches) deep to pahoehoe lava.  Pahipa have greater than 35 percent cobble in the control section.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is medium.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the soil.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for pasture, forest reserve and wildlife habitat. The natural vegetation is koa (Acacia koa), ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), hapuu (Cibotium spp.), olapa (Cheirodendron trigynum) and kopiko (Psychotria hawaiiensis). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Soils of his series are moderately extensive; total extent is about 25,000. MLRA is 160.
