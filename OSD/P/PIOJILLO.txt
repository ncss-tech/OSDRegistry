PIOJILLO SERIES

The Piojillo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from pumice and volcanic ash.  Piojillo soils are on south-facing footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, nonacid, mesic Aridic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Piojillo paragravelly ashy loamy coarse sand--on a footslope of a valley side sloping 14 percent to the south at 6,440 feet elevation--pinyon-juniper forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on November 10, 1999, the soil was dry throughout.) Surface is covered with 30 percent paragravel.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts during the 60 days following the winter solstice. It is moist in some part less than 40 percent and moist in all parts less than 25 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. The soils are driest in May and June. The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Piojillo soils are on south-facing footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides. They formed in slope alluvium derived from pumice and volcanic ash of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 3 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abrojo and Chiminet soils.  Abrojo soils are ashy-skeletal and occur on south-facing backslopes of mesas. Chiminet soils are very shallow and are found on upper backslopes of undulating plateaus and mesas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low surface runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Piojillo soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, skunkbush sumac, oneseed juniper, and twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis/Rhus trilobata/Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB133NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Piojillo soils are of small extent on the southwestern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008. Piojillo is a coined name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon- The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches. (A horizon)

This soil would meet the criteria of a Vitritorrandic subgroup if this subgroup were recognized in Ustipsamments.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006..

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter.  The typical pedon was sampled in part; soil survey sample number S99NM-049-012.
