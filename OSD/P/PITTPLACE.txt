PITTPLACE SERIES

The Pittplace series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, metasedimentary rocks and schist. Pittplace soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2290 millimeters (90 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: At this time there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pittplace soils occur on broad ridges and upper, mountain slopes. Slopes are 9 to 30 percent. Elevations are 303 to 848 meters (990 to 2780 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, metasedimentary rocks and schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2030 to 2550 millimeters (80 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahpah, Rockysaddle, Trailhead, and Wiregrass soils. Ahpah and Wiregrass soils are fine-loamy. Ahpah soils are 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a lithic contact and lack an argillic horizon. Rockysaddle soils are loamy-skeletal. Trailhead soils have parasesquic mineralogy and hues redder than 7.5YR throughout the argillic horizon. The Ahpah soils are on convex slopes and on narrow ridge crests above the Pittplace soils. The Wiregrass soils are on concave areas and on steeper slopes below the Pittplace soils. The Rockysaddle soils are on linear to convex areas on steeper slopes below the Pittplace soils. The Trailhead soils are on broad, gentler slopes above the Pittplace soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber, recreation, wildlife, and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone, scattered redwood, rhododendron, evergreen huckleberry, and salal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt Del Norte area, California 2007. Source of name is from the Pitt Place prairie, a prairie in the Bald Hills near the headwaters of Mettah Creek and Tectah Creek.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 17 centimeters (A horizon)
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 160 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5 & Bt6 horizons)
5. Palehumults feature - Clay does not decrease by as much as 20 percent of its maximum within 150 centimeters of the ground surface.
6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 17 to 67 centimeters, averages 36 percent clay, by weight, and 27 percent rock fragments, by volume.
