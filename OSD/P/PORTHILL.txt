PORTHILL SERIES

The Porthill series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on terraces.  They formed in calcareous silty and clayey glaciolacustrine sediments with very minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layer.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Porthill silt loam, forested; on a slope of 2 percent at 2,200 feet elevation.  When described on October 16, 1972, the soil was moist.  The pedon was redescribed on June 15, 1998. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Porthill soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  They formed in calcareous silty and clayey glaciolacustrine sediments with very minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,400 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold wet winters and warm relatively dry summers.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  The average frost-free period is from 100 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Frycanyon (T), Rubson, and Zioncreek (T) soils.  Frycanyon and Rubson soils are on terraces and are coarse-silty.  Zioncreek soils are on terrace and are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  More than half of the area is used for small grains, alfalfa hay, and alfalfa and clover seed production.  The remainder is used for woodland, pasture, and a small acreage of Christmas trees.  The natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, and western white pine, with an understory of myrtle pachystima, American trailplant, sweetscented bedstraw, starry false Solomons seal, queencup beadlily, baldhip rose, and longtube twinflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana, and northeastern Washington.  The series is moderately extensive.
