DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: North Carolina, Virginia, and possibly South Carolina
Extent: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anson County, North Carolina; 1999. 

REMARKS: Polkton soils were formerly included with the White Store series. However, White Store soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) The 9/2025 update changed the format.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 61 centimeters (7 to 24 inches) Btss1 and Btss2 horizons)
Slickensides - presence of slickensides in the zone from 18 to 61 centimeters (7 to 24 inches) (Btss1 and Btss2 horizons)
Paralithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 91 centimeters (36 inches) (upper boundary of the Cr horizon).
Lithic contact - the occurrence of hard bedrock at a depth of 132 centimeters (52 inches) (upper boundary of the R horizon)
Vertic feature: cracks within 127 centimeters (50 inches) that are 5 mm or more wide through a thickness of 30 centimeters (12 inches) or more for some time in normal years, and slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates in a layer 15 centimeters (6 inches) or more thick that has its upper boundary within 127 centimeters (50 inches) of the soil surface; or a linear extensibility of 2.5 inches or more between the surface and either a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) or a paralithic contact, whichever is shallower
Oxyaquic feature: Saturation with water in one or more layers within 102 centimeters (40 inches) of the surface in normal years for either or both 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days.
