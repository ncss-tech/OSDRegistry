PONTOTOC SERIES

The Pontotoc series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick beds of red Cambrian age sandstone bedrock. These soils occur on nearly level to moderately sloping footslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (66 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Rhodic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pontotoc fine sandy loam--in a cultivated field.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Combined thickness of the upper Bt horizons is 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in)

    Bt3--84 to 170 cm (33 to 67 in); dark red (2.5YR 3/6) sandy clay loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine pores; few roots; 5 percent clay films in pores; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary. Combined thickness of the lower Bt horizons is 46 to 114 cm (18 to 45 in)

    Cr--170 to 195 cm (67 to 77 in); red weakly cemented sandstone bedrock.

Cr layer
Kind: sandstone bedrock of the Hickory formation
Cementation: weakly to moderately
Other features: The sandstone usually contains some glauconite. In some pedons, an interbedded R layer may be present.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in this family. Similar soils include the Cobb, Duval and Springer series.
Cobb soils:  have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and have sola less than 100 cm (40 in) 
Duval soils:  have hue of 5YR or browner and have sandstone bedrock between 100 (40 in) and 150 cm (60 in).
Springer soils: includes hue of 5YR or browner and does not have sandstone within 200 cm (80 in).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone bedrock of the Hickory Sandstone of Cambrian age
Landscape:  dissected plateaus
Landform: footslopes of ridges
Slope:  0 to 8 percent
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly amount occurs during the fall and spring months. The winter and summer months are normally drier.
Mean annual precipitation:  635 to 787 mm (25 to 31 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E index: 38 to 44
Mean annual air temperature:  18.3 to 19.4 degrees C (65 to 67 degrees F)
Frost-free period:  215 to 235 days
Elevation:  274.3 to 579.1 m (900 to 1,900 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hye, Nebgen, Oben, and Yates series.
Hye and Oben soils: occur on similar positions. In addition, Hye soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections. Oben soils have sola less than 50 cm (20 in) to sandstone bedrock.
Nebgen and Yates soils: occur on higher associated ridges, and both soils are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and moderate in the lower part. Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for dry and irrigated cropland and for rangeland. Crops are mostly grain sorghum, peanuts, and vegetables. Considerable acreage is used for irrigated tame pastures. Rangeland vegetation is mostly hooded windmill grass, purple threeawn, sand dropseed, sandbur grasses, and a few live oak, post oak, mesquite, whitebrush, and tasajillo. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas. Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LRR-I: MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. The series is of moderate extent.
