PRADE SERIES

The Prade series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum over marl and soft limestone bedrock.  These soils are on gently sloping undulating plains on dissected plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, thermic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Prade very cobbly clay--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A-- 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very cobbly clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky and weak very fine and fine granular structure; many very fine and fine roots and common medium roots throughout; many fine interstitial and tubular pores; roots are matted on the upper surface of the Bkm horizon; 15 percent subrounded limestone gravel, 30 percent subrounded limestone cobbles, and 10 percent subrounded conglomerate-calcareous gravel; limestone rock fragments are cleanly etched; conglomerate-calcareous fragments are from degrading Bkm horizon; very slightly effervescent throughout; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (Thickness is 10 to 50 cm [4 to 20 in]).

    Bkkm--30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/3) indurated caliche, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; indurated laminar cap is 15 to 25 mm thick; violently effervescent throughout; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 8 to 18 cm [3 to 7 in]).

    Cr--38 to 157 cm (15 to 62 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) moderately cemented marl bedrock, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) moist; massive; no fractures or roots in marl bedrock; moderately alkaline; violently effervescent throughout.

TYPE LOCATION:  Real County, Texas; from the intersection of of Farm Road 336 and Farm Road 3525, about 2.9 miles south southwest on Farm Road 3525, and about 185 ft east in rangeland.
