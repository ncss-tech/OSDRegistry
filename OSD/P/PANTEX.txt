PANTEX SERIES

The Pantex series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey eolian sediments of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level plains.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Pullman and the Estacado, Lofton, and Olton series. Also included are the Lazbuddie, McLean, Pep, and Randall series. 
Pullman, Estacado, and Olton soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Lofton and Lazbuddie soils are on playa benches or shallow depressions. 
McLean and Randall soils are on playa floors and pond. 
Pep soils are on similar landscape positions but have a fine-loamy particle-size class and do not have an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Slow permeability. Surface runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly cultivated to corn, grain sorghum, and winter wheat. A considerable acreage is irrigated. Native vegetation includes blue grama and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, sideoats grama, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover. This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland (R077CY022TX) range site in MLRA-77. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains of Texas (MLRA 77C). The series is extensive.
