POIN SERIES

The Poin series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from gneiss-schist, sandstone, rhyolite, granite, quartzite or welded tuff bedrock. These soils are on bedrock floored plains, hills, ridges and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Poin very flaggy sandy loam, native grassland. (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

   A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very flaggy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent channers and 15 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

   Bw1--5 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely channery sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 45 channers and 15 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

   Bw2--12 to 19 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely flaggy sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 20 percent channers and 60 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual irregular boundary. (combined thickness of Bw1, Bw2 horizons - 7 to 15 inches)

   R--19 inches; fractured gneiss-schist bedrock; few fine roots in some cracks.
