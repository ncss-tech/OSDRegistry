POTTERSVILLE SERIES

The Pottersville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying calcareous, clayey and silty lacustrine deposits. The Pottersville soils are on dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 12 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Pottersville silt loam, on a 45 percent slope in a forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Bt3--51 to 61 cm (20 to 24 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 36 to 76 cm (14 to 30 inches).]

 2Bt4--61 to 79 cm (24 to 31 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; many distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick]

 2BCtk--79 to 117 cm (31 to 46 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very firm; few distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; many fine light gray (10YR 7/2) calcium carbonate nodules; common distinct grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay depletions on vertical faces of peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 inches) thick]

 2Ck--117 to 152 cm (46 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) stratified silty clay, silty clay loam, and silt loam; massive; very firm; many fine light gray (10YR 7/2) calcium carbonate nodules; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Marseilles, Mentor, Sandview, Stubenville, Westmore, and Zenas (T) series. Marseilles soils have a paralithic contact at a depth less than 152 cm (60 inches). Mentor soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 127 cm (50 inches). Sandview soils are deeper than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of soil development. Stubenville soils do not have subhorizons with more than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Westmore soils have rock fragments within the series control section. Zenas soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pottersville soils are on shoulders and backslopes of dissected lake plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 12 to 50 percent. The soils formed 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying calcareous, clayey and silty lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dubois and Haubstadt soils. The somewhat poorly drained Dubois soils are on flats. The moderately well drained Haubstadt soils are on summits and shoulders of dissected lake plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part, and very slow in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for woodland or pasture. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Indiana; MLRA 114B. The series is of small extent.
