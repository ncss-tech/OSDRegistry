PASTORIUS SERIES

The Pastorius series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in cobbly alluvium.  Pastorius soils are on river or stream terraces and have slopes of 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pastorius cobbly loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 18 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual smooth boundary. 

    A2--18 to 51 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent cobbles and 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4) clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of A1, A2 is 30 to 70 cm)

    Bt1--51 to 61 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8) clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt2--61 to 99 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many prominent clay films on faces of peds and as patches on rock fragments; 50 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8) gradual smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 is 30 to 100 cm)

    BC--99 to 142 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 65 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0) gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 61 cm thick)

    2C--142 to 183 cm; extremely cobbly sand; 50 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; neutral.
