POLEY SERIES  

The Poley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone and limestone.  Poley soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Calciargids  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Poley gravelly sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A--0 to 2 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 to 20 percent fine and medium gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)  

    Bt1--2 to 6 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films lining tubular pores and bridging mineral grains; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)  

    Bt2--6 to 18 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and coarse subangular and angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 12 inches thick)  

    Btk--18 to 24 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; violently effervescent, many medium distinct pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) soft rounded and irregular accumulations of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)  

    Bk--24 to 60 inches; white (8 N/) cobbly sandy loam; massive; few fine roots; 20 percent cobble and 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alesna (NM), Hano (AZ), Keeseha (AZ), and Silva (NM),  series.  Hano and Keeseha soils have a calcic horizon at depths less than 20 inches. Silva soils have a calcic horizon at depths greater than 30 inches and have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 50 degrees F.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Poley soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from dominantly  sandstone and limestone.  Elevations range from 4,700 feet to 7,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 56 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 175 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abra, Disterheff, Lynx,  Partri, Pastura, Purner, Rune, Showlow, and Tusayan soils.  Abra, Lynx and Rune soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Disterheff soils have  montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Pastura soils have a hardpan at depths less than 20 inches.  Partri soils have a mollic epipedon.  Purner soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches.  Showlow soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Tusayan soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow  permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Poley soils are used for livestock grazing and  irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is black grama, blue grama,  hairy grama, cane beardgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, winterfat,  rabbitbrush and fourwing saltbush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and northern Arizona and northern New Mexico.  This series is of moderate extent. MLRAs 35, 36 & 39.
