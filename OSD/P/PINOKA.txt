MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anson County, North Carolina; 1999

REMARKS: Pinoka soils were previously mapped as Pinkston soils, which are now located in the mesic temperature regime due to an adjustment of the thermic/mesic temperature regime line. Pinkston soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 18 and 27 inches (Bt horizon)
Paralithic contact--the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 27 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 37 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data will be available from the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon number
