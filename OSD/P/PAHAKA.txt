PAHAKA SERIES

The Pahaka series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium.  Pahaka soils are on fan terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dateland and Denure series.  Dateland and Denure soils do not have buried argillic horizons at moderate depths. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pahaka soils are on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 1100 to 2400 feet.  They formed in Holocene fan alluvium superimposed on Pleistocene relict basin floors and fan terraces.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  Mean annual air temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 240 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Denure and the Shontik soils.  Shontik soils are fine-loamy.  In addition are the Chuckawalla, Gunsight, Momoli and Pinamt soils that do not have buried argillic horizons at moderate depths.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability above and moderately slow in the buried horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and irrigated cropland.  Vegetation is creosotebush, triangleleaf bursage and annual grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  MLRA is 40. The soils of this series are not extensive.
