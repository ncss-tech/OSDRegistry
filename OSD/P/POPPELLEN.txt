POPPELLEN SERIES

Poppellen series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic, volcanic, and mixed rocks. Poppellen soils are on terraces adjacent to hill and mountain drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Poppellen gravelly loam - forestland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 cm; slightly decomposed plant material composed of grass, aspen leaves and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 cm thick)

  A1--1 to 7 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravely loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium, many very fine roots; many very fine discontinuous interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--7 to 34 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and coarse roots, many very fine roots; common fine discontinuous interstitial pores; few fine and medium discontinuous irregular pores; 35 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (20 to 40 cm thick)

    A3--34 to 51 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine, medium and coarse , many very fine roots; many fine discontinuous interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (14 to 25 cm thick)

    C--51 to 120 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine discontinuous interstitial pores; 27 percent gravel; 8 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0);

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Dry in mid-summer through fall for up to 90 days. The soil is moist in the upper part in late fall, winter, spring and early summer. A seasonal water table occurs between 75 and 100 cm during the spring for 20 to 45 days; typic xeric soil moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 5 to 7 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 75 cm.
Depth to C horizon: 51 to 75 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 10 to 18 percent in the upper part and 2-10 in the lower part. 
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel, with cobbles common in some sub-horizons in the lower part.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Eggleson series. Eggleson soils less than 5 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Poppellen soils are on narrow stream terraces of hills and mountains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources, mainly metamorphic rock or volcanic rock, with a component of reworked loess.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,975 to 2,550 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Hourland and Bendastik series. Hourland and Bendastik soils average greater than 27 percent clay, and less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  moderately well drained; very low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Poppellen soils are used for forestland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is quaking aspen, Wood's rose, common choke cherry, lupine, mountain brome, slender wheatgrass, Kentucky bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Nevada.  MLRA 25.  These soils are not extensive.
