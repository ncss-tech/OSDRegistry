PIONEERVIL SERIES


The Pioneervil series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent in intermontane basins, mountain valleys and canyons. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Lostcreek soils are similar, but have a vitrandic surface. Monache soils are similar, but have cumulic epipedons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pioneervil soils are on flood plains at elevations of 3,400 to 4,650 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy alluvium from igneous rocks (dominantly granodiorite). The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 28 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brassey, Grimescreek and Middlefork soils. Brassey soils are well drained, loamy-skeletal and occur on fan remnants. Grimescreek soils are somewhat poorly drained, have cumulic epipedons and occur on lower flood-plain steps. Middlefork soils are well drained, have fine-loamy argillic horizons and occur on hill slopes and fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained with a high water table at 40 to 60 inches below the surface at some time during April through June; very slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability. Pioneervil soils are subject to rare flooding for very brief to brief periods in December through June.
USE AND VEGETATION: Pioneervil soils are used mainly for pastureland. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine and common snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 44. Pioneervil soils are of small extent.
