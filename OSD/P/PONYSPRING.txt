PONYSPRING SERIES

The Ponyspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff. The Ponyspring soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

The Ashone soils are moderately deep to paralithic material, do not have secondary calcium carbonate in the profile and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms. Bidwell soils have 0 to 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms. Coppersmith soils contain 20 to 70 percent durinodes and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July to September due to convection storms. Simpson soils have a mollic epipedon that is 50 to 69 cm thick and have 35 to 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ponyspring soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,290 meters. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cath, Nevu, Okayview and Zoda series. Cath soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees and contain a horizon with a firm and brittle matrix. Nevu soils are moderately deep to a duripan. Okayview soils are shallow to a paralithic contact. Zoda soils are moderately deep to a duripan.
