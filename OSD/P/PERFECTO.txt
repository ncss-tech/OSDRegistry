PERFECTO SERIES

The Perfecto series consist of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, granodiorite, granodiorite gneiss, or quartz monzonite.  These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Perfecto very cobbly very fine sandy loam, on a northwest facing 45 percent mountain slope under lodgepole pine at an elevation of 10,020 feet.  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    E1--5 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; 1 mm silt caps on rock fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION: Gunnison County, Colorado; about 5 miles northwest of Sargents, Colorado; located about 350 feet north and 2,250 feet east of the southwest corner of Section 36, T. 49 N., R. 4 E.; USGS Sargents topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees, 27 minutes, 30 seconds north and longitude 106 degrees, 28 minutes, 53 seconds west, NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depths in this section are measured from the top of the mineral soil surface.
Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section (smcs) is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with the exception of a significant increase in July and August.  The smcs is driest during the fall.  The smcs is too dry for Udic and is considered to have an Ustic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 35 to 45 degrees F.

Legault soils are on backslopes and shoulders and have a paralithic contact at less than 20 inches. Ohman soils are on backslopes and summits and have a paralithic contact at less than 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat excessively drained; very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wood products. Potential native vegetation is lodgepole pine with an understory of common juniper, elk sedge, kinnikinnick, and russet buffaloberry. It is in the Lodgepole Pine Woodland Site, Forest Cover Type 218.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Colorado in LRR E and MLRA 48A. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cochetopa Soil Survey Area, Gunnison National Forest, Gunnison County, Colorado, 1999. The name comes from Perfecto Creek within the area.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon.

Particle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 40 inches. (E2 and Bw horizons)
Albic horizon: the zone from 5 to 17 inches. (E1, E2 horizons)
The presence of silt caps is considered to be diagnostic for this pedon.

Supporting lab data is not available for this soil.  In any future investigations the possibility of spodic horizon should be determined.
