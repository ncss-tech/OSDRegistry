COMPETING SERIES: This is the Redoubt series. Redoubt soils have friable consistency in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash-influenced loess over glacial till
Landform: mountain slopes influenced by glaciation and moraines on till plains
Slopes: 4 to 45 percent
Mean annual temperature: 30 to 34 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 32 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Chuit series, and the Kliskon series. Kliskon soils are on similar landforms but are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loess mantle and moderately high in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: The natural vegetation is characteristic of alpine grasslands, including: bluejoint, forbs, sparse white spruce and alder. Use is restricted to wildlife habitat by the short growing season.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is extensive.
