PETELLEN SERIES

The Petellen series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated conglomerate. Petellen soils are on mountains with slopes that range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is is the Dipsea series.  Dipsea soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to a paralithic or lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Petellen soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 10 to 450 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fiedler, Nanningcreek, Oeschger, and Scotiabluff soils.  Fiedler, Nanningcreek, Oeschger, and Scotiabluff soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Nanningcreek soils have redoximorphic features between 50 and 100 centimeters of the mineral soil surface. Oeschger soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Scotiabluff soils are 50 to 100 centimeters to a paralithic contact, on ridges and linear to strongly convex mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, high runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for commercial timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes coast redwood, Douglas-fir, Sitka spruce, grand fir, tanoak, red alder, blueblossom, coyotebrush, salal, California huckleberry, western swordfern, thimbleberry, and oxalis. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
