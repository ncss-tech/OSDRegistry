PENGPONG SERIES

The Pengpong series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from mixed rocks.  Pengpong soils are on stabilized parna dunes.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Pengpong silt loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A1--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial and few very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    C1--18 to 69 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial and few very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (40 to 56 cm thick)

    C2--69 to 117 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial and many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (46 to 60 cm thick)

    C3--117 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine, fine and medium interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION: White Pine County, Nevada; about 1 mile northeast of Scottys Meadow; about 1,000 feet north and 100 feet west of the southeast corner of section 22, T. 12 N; R. 67 E.; USGS Baking Powder Flat, 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 53 minutes 05 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 25 minutes 47 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and early spring; usually moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through early October due to summer convection storms; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Other features: The fine earth fraction is made up dominantly of spheroidal aggregates of eolian origin and contains broken sand-sized shell fragments. Spheroidal aggregates break down to finer particles when rubbed.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 14 percent.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent 
A horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

C horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Silt loam, with more than 15 percent sand greater than very fine.
Clay content: 10 to 18 percent.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Medburn, Perwick and Turbyfill series.  Medburn soils lack silt loam textures in the particle-size control section and the sand sized fraction is not dominated by spheroidal lime nodules.  Perwick soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Turbyfill soils lack silt loam textures in the particle-size control section and the sand-sized fraction is not dominated by spheroidal lime nodules.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pengpong soils are on stabilized parna dunes. They formed in eolian material derived from lacustrine sediments. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,495 to 1,770 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ewelac and Biji soils. Ewelac and Biji soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Pengpong soils are used for rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, black greasewood, basin big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada, in Spring Valley and western Utah. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 cm. (part of the C1 and C2 horizons).
