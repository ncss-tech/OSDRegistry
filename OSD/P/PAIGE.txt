PAIGE SERIES


The Paige series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over till derived from volcanic rock. The Paige soils are on moraines.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1372 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Medial, mixed, frigid Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Paige medial sandy loam on an east facing (80 degree), 8 percent slope at an elevation of 2136 meters.  When described on 10/19/2001 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kneeridge soils.  Kneeridge soils do not have densic contact within 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Paige soils are on moraines. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over till weathered from volcanic rock. Elevation is 1900 to 2270 meters. The climate is sub-humid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 790 to 1600 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7.9 degrees C. Frost free season is 40 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kneeridge and Waca soils. The Kneeridge soils are very deep and consist completely of colluvial materials in the control section.  Waca soils are moderately deep to soft volcanic bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability above the densic material. Low to medium runoff. The soils are not flooded or ponded.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife and urban development.  Vegetation is white fir and Jeffrey pine with an understory of snowberry, aster, and thistle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Paige soils are of minor extent California in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains
