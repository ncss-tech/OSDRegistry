PAUDTHEEAGON SERIES

The Paudtheeagon series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  The depth to hard bedrock is 100 to 150 cm.  Paudtheeagon soils are on mountains slopes and slides.  Slopes range from 35 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.
