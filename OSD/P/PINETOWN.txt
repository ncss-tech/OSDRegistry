PINETOWN SERIES

The Pinetown series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Pinetown soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 4 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Calcic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pinetown loam, on a south facing, concave, 7 percent slope in a Utah juniper rangeland at an elevation of 6,600 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk1--3 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine and fine subangular blocks; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and gravel sized hardpan fragments; slightly effervescent (21 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common coatings 1 to 3 mm thick on undersides of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk2--9 to 16 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine, few fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; 70 percent gravel and gravel sized hardpan fragments; strongly effervescent (36 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated by coats 1 to 3 mm thick on undersides of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bk horizon ranges from 15 to 18 inches thick)

    Bkm--16 to 26 inches; indurated calcium carbonate hardpan.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 7 miles south of Little Mountain; located about 2,600 feet north and 100 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 17, T. 4 S., R. 20 E., SLBM; Vernal N.W., Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 28 minutes 9 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 42 minutes 57 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.

Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.
Depth to calcic horizon:  2 to 5 inches
Depth to petrocalcic horizon:  10 to 20 inches
Surface rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent gravel

Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments (predominantly gravel from quartzite, sandstone, limestone, and shale lithology).

A horizon:
Value:  3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4

Bk horizon:
Value:  5 to 7 dry
Chroma:  3 or 4
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 40 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Childers and Curhollow series.  A possible competitor is the Pibler series.

Childers soils formed in volcanic parent materials and are underlain by basalt.

Curhollow soils have  mean annual soil temperatures greater than 51 degrees F.

Pibler:  has a xeric moisture pattern and includes very shallow depths to hardpan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks
Landform:  fan remnants
Slopes:  4 to 8 percent
Elevation: 5,900 to 6,800 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  8 to 12 inches
Frost-free period:  110 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abracon, Clapper, and Montwel series.  

Abracon soils occur on fan remnants and  are very deep.
Clapper soils occur on hillslopes and are very deep.
Montwel soils occur on hillslopes and are moderately deep to weathered shale.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The potential native plant community is Utah juniper, pinyon pine, Salina wildrye, bluebunch wheatgrass, galleta, black sagebrush, and Mormon tea.  This soil has been correlated to the Semidesert Shallow Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) - 034XY233UT range site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 199.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 16 inches.  (Bk2 horizon)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 16 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Petrocalcic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 26 inches.  (Bkm 
horizon)

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Percent calcium carbonate determined by calcimeter.
