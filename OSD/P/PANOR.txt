PANOR SERIES

The Panor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  The Panor soils are on relict alluvial flats.  Slopes are 2 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Panor clay loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) About 5 percent of the soil surface is covered with pebbles.

    A--0 to 1 inch; white (10YR 8/1) clay loam, white (10YR 8/1) moist; strong medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1/2 to 2 inches thick)

    Bk--1 to 5 inches; white (10YR 8/1) silt loam, white (10YR 8/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; few fine soft lime masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bky--5 to 23 inches; white (10YR 8/1) clay loam, with few patches of pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) white (10YR 8/2) and light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; few fine soft threads, patches and filaments of gypsum and lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.  (16 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bk1--23 to 31 inches; white (10YR 8/1) gravelly clay loam, white (10YR 8/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent pebbles; common soft lime masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    2Bk2--31 to 61 inches; white (10YR 8/1) with few patches of pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) gravelly clay loam, white (10YR 8/2) and pink (5YR 7/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent pebbles; few fine soft lime masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; approximately 6 miles southwest of the junction of U.S. 95 and State Route 160, about 4,000 feet south and 1,000 feet west of the northeast corner of section 22, T. 16 S., R. 51 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry, but moist for short periods during winter and spring months and for 10 to 20 days periods following summer convection storms.

Soil temperature - 62 to 67 degrees.

Reaction - Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 15 to 40 percent.


Control section - Percent clay:  27 to 35 percent.

Rock fragments:  Up to 30 percent.


A horizon - Chroma:  1 through 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.


Bk and Bky horizon - Value: 6 through 8, dry or moist.

Chroma: 1 through 3 moist.

Gypsum:  Few soft threads or patches, 2-10 mm in size, in some subhorizons of some pedons.

Texture : Silt loam and clay loam

Consistence: Slightly hard dry, very friable moist and sticky and slightly plastic moist.


2Bk horizon - Value:  6 through 8 dry or moist

Chroma:  1 through 3 moist.

Texture:  Clay loam and gravelly clay loam, with minor strata of silt loam in some pedons.

Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent mainly pebbles.

Consistence:  Very friable or friable, slightly sticky.  Plastic or slightly plastic.

Effervescence:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kettleman(CA), Mescal(AZ), and Panoche(CA) soils. The Kettleman soils have a paralithic contact at depths between 20 to 40 inches.  The Mescal soils have control sections with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and lack values of 7 or 8.  The Panoche soils lack summer moisture, lack color values of 7 or 8, and have lime content of less than 5 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Panor soils are on relict alluvial flats.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 2 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 2,300 to 2,800 feet.  The winters are cool and the summers are hot.  The mean annual precipitation is about 3 to 5 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 to 66 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nomie and Nowoy soils.  The Nomie soils are on erosional fan remnants and have a natric horizon.  Nowoy soils are on broad drainageways and are formed in stratified mixed alluvium sediments from mixed sources.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Medium or rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is scattered desertholly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Nye County, Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 30.
