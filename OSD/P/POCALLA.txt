POCALLA SERIES


The Pocalla series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments on marine terraces.  The soils are on nearly level or gently sloping low ridges on Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Arenic Plinthic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pocalla sand--cultivated.  (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand; weak medium granular structure; loose; common fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 9 inches thick)

     E--8 to 23 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand; weak medium granular structure; loose; few fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 23 inches thick)

     Bt--23 to 36 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; sand grains coated and bridged with clay; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

     E'--36 to 46 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loamy sand; single grained; loose; few fine roots; few fine pores; common medium sized pockets of pale brown (10YR 6/3) uncoated sand grains; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 24 inches thick)

     Btv1--46 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay loam; common medium yellowish red (5YR 5/8), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; common medium nodules of plinthite (about 10 percent); strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

     Btv2--60 to 72 inches; mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), yellowish red (5YR 5/8), and gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine pores; common medium nodules of plinthite (about 15 percent); very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Marion County, South Carolina; 7.5 miles north of Marion; 700 feet north of intersection of U.S. Highway 501 and South Carolina Highway 22; 300 feet west of U.S. Highway 501.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 72 to more than 80 inches.   The soil ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.  Nodules of plinthite range from common to many in the Btv horizon.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy loam.

The E' horizon or the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sand or loamy sand.

The Btv horizon commonly is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray.  Some pedons have a matrix with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  The Btv horizon is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with more than 5 percent nodules of plinthite.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Doucette, Lilbert, and Stilson series in the same family, plus the Blanton, Bonneau, Brogdon, Eustis, Fuquay, Kenansville, Lucy, Troup, and Wagram series in similar families.  Bonneau, Doucette, Fuquay, Kenansville, Lilbert, Lucy, Stilson, and Wagram soils are not bisequal.  Blanton and Troup soils are grossarenic.   Brogdon soils have A and E horizons less than 20 inches thick.  Eustis soils have a sandy particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pocalla soils are on nearly level or gently sloping low ridges of the Coastal Plain.  Slope gradients are 0 to 6 percent.  The soil formed in unconsolidated sandy and loamy Coastal Plain deposits.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 50 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 66 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 220 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar and competing Blanton, Bonneau, Brogdon, Eustis, Fuquay, Lucy, and Wagram series plus the Dothan, Goldsboro, Lakeland, Lynchburg, and Norfolk series.  Dothan, Norfolk, Goldsboro, and Lynchburg soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.  Lakeland soils are sandy throughout and do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper subsoil and moderate in the lower subsoil.  These soils have a perched water table primarily during winter and early spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils have been cleared and used for growing cotton, corn, soybeans, and other crops.  Forested areas are in pine with scattered mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Middle and Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina and North Carolina.  The series is of moderate extent.
