COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape--Southeast coastal plain estuaries
Landform--Estuarine tidal streams and creeks
Parent material--Fine-silty estuarine deposits
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Water depth range--0 to 3 meters (0 to 10 feet) below mean sea level
Water salinity range--0.5 to 5 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Kill Devil and Lost soils.
Kill Devil soils--Are in fluviomarine bottoms, coves, and low-energy lagoon bottoms, have a fine-loamy particle size class, do not contain sulfidic materials, and are generally 10Y or more gley. 
Lost soils--Are in submerged tidal marshes, have a fine-loamy particle size class, and do not contain sulfidic materials.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately low to moderately high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by brackish water. The water level is primarily driven by wind tides.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--The area is used for recreational fishing, swimming, hunting, and boating. Uses also include commercial fishing and crabbing.
Typical vegetation--Vegetation is virtually absent as Princess Anne soils may contain high concentrations of porewater sulfide due to finer textures and increased organic matter. Where vegetation is present, wild celery (Vallisneria americana) and stonewort (Nitella sp.) have been observed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Coastal plain estuaries in North Carolina and Virginia.
Land Resource Regions--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s)--153B
Extent--Small  

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Region

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Currituck County, North Carolina, 2026

REMARKS:
The series is named after the former County of Princess Anne, Virginia. In 1963, the county merged into the City of Virginia Beach. Princess Anne soils were previously mapped as water in North Carolina and Virginia soil surveys.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022):
Histic epipedon--The zone from 0 to 28 centimeters.
Sapric soil materials--The zone from 0 to 28 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the original soil volume.
Hyposulfidic materials--The zone from 0 to 28 centimeters has an initial pH that decreases by 1 or more units but remains at a value of 4.0 or more after 16 weeks of moist aerobic incubation.
Hypersulfidic materials--The zone from 28 to 120 centimeters has a pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist aerobic incubation.
Fluidity--The zone from 28 to 210 centimeters has a fluidity class of moderately fluid to very fluid.
Peraquic feature--Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface (permanently submerged).
