PIEGAN SERIES

The Piegan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or till over residuum. These soils occur on nivation hollows on ridges, mountain slopes and glacial-valley walls. Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,825 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Piegan extremely cobbly sandy loam, in alpine meadow.  This profile was describe on a 25 percent slope at 2,276 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A1--0 to 7 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) extremely cobbly sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common very fine tubular and irregular pores; 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

      A2--7 to 17 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) extremely gravelly sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular and irregular pores; 55 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.

      Bw1--17 to 26 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary.

      Bw2--26 to 77 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt smooth boundary.

      2R--77 cm; argillite bedrock.
