PINAVETES SERIES

The Pinavetes series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from mixed material on dunes. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Pinavetes loamy sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
 A--0 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 15 inches thick)
 C1--10 to 35 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 30 inches thick)
 C2--35 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Sandoval County, New Mexico; 1,100 feet south and 1,525 feet east of the northwest corner of Sec. 24, T. 14 N., R. 2 E. 106 degrees, 41 minutes, 04 seconds west longitude; 35 degrees, 25 minutes, 56 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Intermittently moist in some part during July to September and December to February. Driest during May and June.
Soil moisture - Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil temperature - 50 to 57 degrees F.
Calcium carbonate - effervescent in the control section; typically effervescent throughout the pedon
Reaction - slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline

A horizon
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y
Value: 4through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma: 3 through 6
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand 
Rock fragments: Less than 15 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Calladito (NM), Dwyer (WY), Karval (CO), Mido (UT), Orpha (WY), Pensom (AZ), Tullock (MT), Valent (CO), and Wigton (CO) series. Calladito soils have 8 to 10 inches precipitation and are noneffervescent. Dwyer, Karval, Valent, Orpha, and Tullock soils are moist in some part periodically during May and June. Karval soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Mido soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder. Pensom soils are deep to sandstone. Tullock soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Valent and Wigton soils are noncalcareous.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinavetes soils formed in eolian material. Pinavetes soils are on valley sides and dunes. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Elevations range from 5,200 to 7,200 feet. Mean annual air temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, most of which occurs in July, August and September. The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clovis, Palma, and Penistaja series. Clovis, Palma, and Penistaja soils have argillic horizons and control sections finer than loamy fine sand.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing. Native vegetation is blue grama, Indian ricegrass, and dropseed species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona and western New Mexico; it is moderately extensive. MLRAs 35 & 36.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Sandoval County, New Mexico, 1987.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (A horizon)
Psamment feature - Texture of loamy fine sand or coarser in all subhorizons below 10 inches. The series was proposed in Socorro County, NM, but the type location has been changed to Sandoval County and central concepts of the series changed. The classification has not been changed.
