PADDOCK SERIES

The Paddock series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy lodgment till of the Wadena Lobe of the Late Wisconsin glaciation. These soils are on linear or concave footslopes on drumlins.  These soils are deep to a densic contact.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 720 millimeters.  Mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Todd County, Minnesota, 1985.

REMARKS:  
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 83 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 152 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap); 
glossic horizon--the zone from 20 to 38 centimeters; (E/B horizon); 
argillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 102 centimeters (Bt horizon); 
densic contact--the zone starting at 102 centimeters;
base saturation--greater than 60 percent;
aquic conditions within the upper 25 centimeters of the argillic horizon;
redoximorphic features between depths of 20 and 91 centimeters.

This soil was previously classified in the Udollic Ochraqualfs.  The Udollic Epiaqualfs subgroups and was considered poorly, very poorly and somewhat poorly drained.  The Becida series was developed in 1996 to represent the poorly drained concept of these soils.

The upper part of the profile appears to have been modified and stone lines have been identified in the field.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  
Pedon 87MN111043 is the type location.  
Laboratory data--KSSL pedon 81MN153004 was sampled as a poorly drained Paddock and has been correlated to Becida series.
