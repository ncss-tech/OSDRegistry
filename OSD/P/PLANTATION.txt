COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Florida Everglades
Landform(s): on broad flats adjacent to the deeper organic soils in fresh water marshes and swamps 
Parent material: organic materials formed from remains of hydrophytic herbaceous plant overlying thin beds of marine sandy materials overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean annual air temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C (77 to 78 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 127 to 165 centimeters (50 to 65 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Buffalo Tiger soils--are deep to limestone bedrock, are Histosols, and are on similar landform positions
Coopertown soils--are shallow to limestone bedrock, are Histosols, and are on similar landform positions 
Gator Lake soils--are very shallow to limestone bedrock, are Histosols, and are on similar landform positions 
Loxahatche soils--are very deep, are Histosols, and are on similar landform positions 
Macks Camp soils--are deep to limestone bedrock, are Histosols, and are on slightly higher landform positions 
Shark Valley soils--are moderately deep to limestone bedrock, are Histosols, and are on similar landform positions 
Tamiami soils--are moderately deep to limestone bedrock, are Histosols, and are on similar landform positions 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Very high to high 
Permeability: Rapid
Surface Runoff: Negligible to very low
Ponding: Under natural conditions, this soil is covered by water (ponded)- frequently for very long duration 4 to 9 months

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: Wildlife habitat, rangeland, pasture, and urban land. 
Dominant vegetation: sawgrass, paspalum, maidencane, and cutthroat grass. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Florida Everglades and associated areas.  The series is of moderate extent. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Broward County, Florida; 1974. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 

   1.  Particle-size control section: 25 to 102 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)
   2. Histic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Oa1 and Oa2 horizons). 
   3. Lithic contact - 84 to 109 centimeters (35 to 45 inches) (2R horizon)

These soils were formerly classified as Typic Psammaquents based on the mineral soil beneath the Histic epipedon. Amendment Notice no. 1 of NSTH now classifies these soils as Inceptisols.
