PACHEL SERIES

The Pachel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pachel loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--6 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine tubular pores; few very fine roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--13 to 22 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse and medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine tubular pores; few very fine roots; many faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 12 to 34 inches)

    Bk--22 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 40 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; common faint lime coating on some of the pebbles and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fallon County, Montana, 1991.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1231.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 22 inches (Ap and Bt horizons); an argillic horizon from 6 to 22 inches which is also the particle-size control section (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).  Pachel soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
