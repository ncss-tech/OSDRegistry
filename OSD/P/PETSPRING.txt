PETSPRING SERIES

The Petspring series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from highly weathered granitic rocks on mountains, hills and pediments.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic, shallow Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Petspring very gravelly coarse sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; slightly sticky and nonplastic; very few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 55 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--3 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; slightly sticky and nonplastic; very few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Cr--10 cm; highly weathered granite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mineral County, Nevada in the Gabbs Valley Range, approximately 2,600 feet north and 2,600 feet west of the southwest corner of section 29, T. 9 N., R. 34 E.; USGS Mount Feguson, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 37 minutes 42 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 13 minutes 50 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.6266667 latitude, -118.230556 longitude..

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and autumn, except moist for 10 to 20 cumulative days between July and October due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to weathered bedrock: 10 to 25 cm.
Depth to unweathered bedrock: 50 to 75 cm.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 55 percent, predominantly 2 to 5 mm gravel.

A horizons
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry, or moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Shoken series.  Shoken soils are not moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days between July and September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Petspring soils are on mountain backslopes, hills and rock pediment remnants.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from granodiorite.  Elevations are 1,320 to 2,130 meters.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The climate is cool semiarid, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperatures range from 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Budihol and Chill soils.   Budihol and Chill soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and Chill soils also have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Petspring soils are used principally for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, desert needlegrass, littleleaf horsebrush, spiny hopsage and galleta grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Nevada.  The soils are not extensive. MLRA 27.
