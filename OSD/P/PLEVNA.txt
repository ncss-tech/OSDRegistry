PLEVNA SERIES

The Plevna series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These nearly level soils are on flood plains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains, MLRA 79. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters (30 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F), at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Plevna fine sandy loam - on a 3 percent slope in native grass at an elevation of 523 meters (1715 feet). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) As described on November 1, 1968.

 A1--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches); black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

 A2--25 to 43 centimeters (10 to 17 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; few medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation with diffuse boundaries in the lower 13 centimeters (5 inches); moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 61 centimeters (10 to 24 inches).) 

 Bg--43 to 102 centimeters (17 to 40 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sandy loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and brown (10YR 5/3) irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation with diffuse boundaries throughout; many fine roots to 61 centimeters (24 inches), few below; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (38 to 76 centimeters (15 to 30 inches) thick.) 

 2C--102 to 200 centimeters (40 to 80 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation with diffuse boundaries in upper 25 centimeters (10 inches); moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Pratt County, Kansas; 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) east and 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) north of Pratt, Kansas; 183 meters (600 feet) west and 6 meters (20 feet) north of the southeast corner of sec. 30, T. 27 S., R. 11 W; USGS Cairo topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 39 minutes 36.5 seconds N. and longitude 98 degrees 33 minutes 31.3 seconds W., WGS84.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bunejug , Ninnescah, Ralsen,  Rosecreek, and Suckercreek.
Bunejug soils do not have a cambic horizon.
Ninnescah soils have secondary carbonates within 25 centimeters (10 inches).
Ralsen soils have fewer frost free days and a mean annual air temperature less than 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).
Rosecreek and Suckercreek soils have free carbonates in the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy alluvium over sandy alluvium
Landform: flood plains in river valleys
Slopes: 0 to 1 percent
Elevation: 480 to 650 meters (1574 to 2132 feet)
Mean annual air temperature: 13 to 14 degrees C (55 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 640 to 840 millimeters (26 to 34 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 180 to 200 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Dillwyn, Kanza, Pratt, and Zenda soils. 
Dillwyn soils are formed from eolian sands and are higher on the landscape.
Kanza soils are formed from fine eolian sands and are on similar landscape positions. 
Pratt soils are well drained and on undulating or hilly higher topographic positions.
Zenda soils are on low terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: poorly drained 
Runoff: low or very low 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately rapid. 
The groundwater table is within 30 centimeters (12 inches) from January to December. This soil is frequently flooded. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Almost all areas are in native meadow and range. Vegetation is tall prairie grasses. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. Land Resource Region H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range: MLRA 79, Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is moderately extensive.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth edition, 2014

3/2017 BKN Updated intro to current standards. Added elevation and slope to typical pedon. Changed to tabular format. Added in metric units. Added clay content, sand content, and reaction to RIC. Added latitude, longitude, and datum to type location. Updated MAAT and MAP in geographic setting and added in precipitation pattern and FFD. Updated geographically associated soils by removing Cohoctah and adding Ninnescah, Ralsen, and Suckercreek. Changed permeability to Ksat. Added LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent. Added lab data to additional data.  

ADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data is available for Pedon ID 88KS155015R.
