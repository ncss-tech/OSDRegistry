PADGETT SERIES


The Padgett series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in recent clayey alluvium derived from Permian age sediments. These nearly level soils are on flood plains of wide creeks. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.

TYPE LOCATION: Archer County, Texas; about 5.19 miles miles north on State Highway 79 to a small bridge from the intersection of State Highway 25 and State Highway 79 in Archer City; located about 2200 feet east of bridge in a rangeland area in the flood plain of the Little Wichita River. Latitude: 33 degrees, 40 minutes, 05 seconds North; Longitude: 98 degrees, 36 minutes, 17 seconds West. Archer City NE topographic quadrangle; NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: An Ustic soil moisture regime. The soil is dry in some parts for more than 90 but less than 160 days, cumulative in normal years.  
Mean annual soil temperature: 62 to 66.5 degrees F.
Vertic features: 14 to 80 inches This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls 3 to 8 inches higher than microdepressions.
Distance between the center of the microknoll and the center of the microdepression is about 5 to 15 feet. The microknoll makes up about 50 percent, the intermediate, or area between the knoll and depression, about 25 percent. When dry, cracks 0.5 to 2 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of 45 inches or more. Cracks remain open for 150 or more cumulative days during most years. Slickensides begin at a depth of 6 to 15 inches.

Port, Weswood and Wheatwood series: have fine-silty particle-size control section.
Mangum and Westfork soils: lack intersecting slickensides. 
Mangum soils: contain strata and bedding planes within a depth of 50 inches
Westfork soils: have cumulic surfaces thicker than 20 inches.
Yomont soils: have coarse-silty particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Very slow permeability. Runoff is high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly as rangeland, but some areas are cropped to small grains, cotton and forage sorghums. Native vegetation is buffalograss, Texas wintergrass, vine mesquite, western wheatgrass, canada wildrye with an overstory of scattered pecan, green ash, oak species and hackberry.
Mesquite is a common invader.
