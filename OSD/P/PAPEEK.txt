PAPEEK SERIES

The Papeek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills and mountain slopes and toe slopes.  These soils formed in material weathered from metavolcanic or metasedimentary rock.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lassen County, California; about 1.7 miles S of the intersection of Highway 36 and the Susan River on the dirt road parallel to Williams Creek and 500 feet W of this road; about 2200 feet W and 2800 feet N of the SE corner of section 18, T.29 N., R.11 E. Fredonyer Peak Quandrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section (6 to 20 inches) is dry from July 15th to November 1st (107 days) and is moist in all parts from December 1st to May 15th.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from May 15 to November 15th. The thickness of the solum and depth to soft bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The surface is covered with 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Vertical cracks, 1 to 2 cm wide, extend from the surface to the base of the Bt horizon from mid-July through October.

The A horizon dry color is is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 2.5Y 6/4. Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 2.5Y 4/4.  It is clay loam, cobbly loam or cobbly clay loam modified by 5 to 25 percent cobbles and gravel.

The Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4, 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/4, 2.5Y 6/2 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4, 2.5Y 4/2 or 4/4.  It is clay or gravelly clay modified by 5 to 20 percent gravel.

The BCt horizon dry color is 2.5Y 7/4, 7/6 or 5Y 7/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/4, 6/4, 5/6 or 5Y 5/2.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam modified by 0 to 10 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Papeek soils are on hills and mountain back slopes and toe slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from metavolcanic or metasedimentary rock.  Elevation is 4,800 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 to 30 inches with 30 to 60 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Deadwood, Gavel, Outland, Penstock and Ulhalf soils.  Deadwood soils are shallow to bedrock and are on ridges.  Gavel and Outland soils have very gravelly loam subsoils.  Penstock soils are very deep and have a very gravelly loam subsoil.  Ulhalf soils are deep and have a gravelly clay loam subsoil.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is medium or rapid; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Papeek soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife and watershed.  The vegetation is Jeffrey or Ponderosa pine, black oak, western juniper and antelope bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California, Lassen County, California.  The soils of this series are not extensive.
