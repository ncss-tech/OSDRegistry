PONIL SERIES

The Ponil series consists of deep or very deep well drained soils that formed in colluvial deposits derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on sides of mountains and slopes are 10 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ponil stony loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 cm; undecomposed forest litter.

    Oe--1 to 3 cm; partially decomposed forest litter. (Combined thickness of O horizons - 0 to 5 cm)

    A--3 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stony loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky, plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 15 percent rock fragments; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

   Bt1--13 to 41 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky, very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many thick clay films on peds; about 5 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--41 to 64 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; many distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottles, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse prisms parting to moderate coarse angular and subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; sticky, very plastic; common fine and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; many thick clay films on peds; about 5 percent rock fragments; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons - 40 to 75 cm)

    C--64 to 155 cm; light gray (5Y 7/2) clay, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; many distinct mottles of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, sticky, very plastic; common fine and coarse roots; common medium tubular pores; many pressure faces; 10 percent rock fragments, weakly calcareous; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crow, Dargol, Depew, Fuera, Lakoa, Lubrecht and Ordnance series.  Crow soils have strong prismatic structure in the B horizon and an AB horizon.  Dargol, Lakoa, Lubrecht and Ordnance soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Depew soils have an AB horizon.  Fuera soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Elevation--2125 to 2600 meters 
Slope--10 to 35 percent
Parent material--colluvial deposits derived from sandstone and shale
Climate--continental
Mean annual precipitation--410 to 480 mm with about 60 percent falling during the frost-free season
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 7 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for native range, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Principal vegetation is pinyon, juniper, oak, mountain mahogany, blue grama, little bluestem, mountain muhly and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ponil soils are moderately extensive in the mountains of northern New Mexico; MLRA 48A
