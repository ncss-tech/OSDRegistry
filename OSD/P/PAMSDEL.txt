PAMSDEL SERIES

The Pamsdel series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone with a minor component of shale. Pamsdel soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic, shallow Haploduridic Durixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Pamsdel gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered with about 5 percent lichen, 5 percent mosses, 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles. Lithology of the rock fragments is limestone and shale.

 Bqkm2--79 to 135 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) cemented material, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; extremely hard and slightly rigid; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; strongly cemented by secondary silica and calcium carbonate; few reddish brown (5YR 5/4) relict iron concentrations; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bqkm horizons is 76 to 140 cm thick) 

 Bqk--135 to 157 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravel, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) moist; few very fine and fine roots; 85 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; many brown (7.5YR 4/4) irregular iron concentrations; secondary silica cementing sand grains to rock fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pamsdel soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone with a minor component of shale. The elevation ranges from 1,750 to 2,350 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 350 mm, the mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jarab and Ursine series. Jarab soils have a duripan that is strongly cemented or less. Ursine soils do not have a mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Pamsdel soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes mountain big sagebrush, Stansbury cliffrose, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass. This pedon is correlated to R028AY127NV, Loamy Fan Piedmont 12-14 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
