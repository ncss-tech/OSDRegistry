PIPESTONE SERIES

The Pipestone series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash on outwash plains, lake plains, beach ridges, and water-worked till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Pipestone sand, on an east-facing, convex, 1 percent slope in an idle field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 E--20 to 28 cm (8 to 11 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; common medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; moderately acid; abrupt broken boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 Bhs--28 to 38 cm (11 to 15 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; common fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 Bs--38 to 79 cm (15 to 31 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand; single grain; loose; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [10 to 58 cm (4 to 23 inches) thick]

 C--79 to 152 cm (31 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand; single grain; loose; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pipestone soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, beach ridges, and till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent but are dominantly 0 to 4 percent. Pipestone soils formed in sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The excessively drained Oakville and Grattan soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Granby, Kingsville, and Newton soils are in a drainage sequences with Pipestone soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The water table fluctuates from near the surface during prolonged wet periods to depths greater than 122 cm (4 feet) in dry seasons. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between October and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is or has been cultivated. Some areas are in permanent pasture. Special crops such as blueberries, cucumbers, and melons are important crops on this soil. Many areas are in various stages of reforestation. Natural forests are American basswood, eastern cottonwood, northern red oak, bitternut hickory, white ash, swamp white oak, and red maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 97, 98, 99, 142, 144A, 149B in southern Michigan, northeastern Indiana, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York. The series is of large extent.
