PLUGHAT SERIES

The Plughat series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from sedimentary materials.  Plughat soils are on plains and interfluves.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County Area soil survey area, Colorado.  The name was taken from a mesa in the area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 3 to 23 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 and part of the Btk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizons)
Argillic horizons:  The zone from 3 to 27 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 27 to 48 inches.  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)

Other features:  

Remarks:  This soil series was originally a bedrock substratum phase of the Wiley series.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
