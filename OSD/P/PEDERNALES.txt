PEDERNALES SERIES 

The Pedernales series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey, calcareous slope alluvium over residuum. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping alluvial plain remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brackett, Hext, and Menard series.
Brackett soils: have paralithic contact with limestone within 50 cm and are on higher backslopes of ridges on dissected limestone plateaus.
