PULASKI SERIES

The Pulaski series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable flood plain soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments of Holocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping flood plain soils are on small tributaries in the Cross Timbers (MLRA-84A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Udic Ustifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Pulaski fine sandy loam-cultivated, at an elevation of 260 m (850 ft). (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Ap horizon is 0 to 30 cm [0 to 12 in]) 

    A--18 to 48 cm (7 to 19 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 51 cm [4 to 20 in]) 

    C1--48 to 102 cm (19 to 40 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; few thin strata of darker colored fine sandy loam in lower part; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the C1 horizon is 41 to 104 cm [16 to 41 in]) 

    C2--102 to 163 cm (40 to 64 in); reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive, slightly hard, very friable; common thin strata of loamy fine sand; slightly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Oklahoma; about 6 miles north and 1 mile east of Chandler; 1,135 feet north and 200 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 2, T. 15 N., R. 4 E.

Effervescence: none 

A horizon: 
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist

COMPETING SERIES: There are no known series in the same family. Yahola soils are in a similar family.
Yahola soils: are calcareous throughout

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: loamy alluvial sediments of Holocene age
Landscape: alluvial plains
Landform: flood plains
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 14.4 to 17.2 degrees C (58 to 63 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 762 to 1020 mm (30 to 40 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gaddy, Tribbey, Yahola, Ashport, Cyril, Easpur, Gracemont, Gracemore, and Port series. 
Cyril, Tribbey, and Yahola soils: occur on similar positions; in addition, Ashport, Easpur, and Port soils: occur on slightly higher positions; in addition Ashport and Port soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine-silty textural control section; Easpur soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine-loamy textural control section 
Cyril soils have a mollic epipedon 
Gaddy, Gracemont, and Gracemore soils: usually occur on flood plains nearer the stream channel of the larger streams; in addition, Gracemont and Gracemore soils have an apparent water table within 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) of the soils surface and are calcareous throughout; and Gracemore soils have a sandy control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: well drained 
Permeability: moderately rapid
Runoff: negligible 
Flooding: these soils are occasionally or frequently flooded for very brief periods of time during the months of March to October

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly cultivated to alfalfa, small grains, grain sorghums, cotton, and tame pasture. Native vegetation is tall and midgrasses with an overstory of pecan, black walnut, American elm, eastern cottonwood, and tamarisk. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR J; Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A) of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas. The series is extensive.
