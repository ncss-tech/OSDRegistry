PATILO SERIES

The Patilo series consists of very deep, well drained , moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in locally reworked eolian sands over residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils occur on interfluves and side slopes of low ridges on hills. Slope range is 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm (31 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.6 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Grossarenic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Patilo fine sand, on a north-facing, convex, 4 percent slope in pastureland at an elevation of 380 m (1,247 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Erath County, Texas; 1970. The name "Patilo" comes from a community in northeastern Erath County. The community of Patillo established in 1890 was named for pioneer area rancher John Patillo, but the post office name was recorded as "Patilo". 

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with the Nimrod series. The series was separated based on depth to the argillic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 127 to 177 cm (50 to 74 in) (Btg horizons)

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in) (A horizon)
Albic horizon: 10 to 127 cm (4 to 50 in) (E horizon)
Argillic horizon: 127 to 188 cm (50 to 74 in) (Btg horizons)
Redox concentrations: 127 to 188 cm (50 to 74 in) (Btg horizons)
Episaturation: 127 to 188 cm (50 to 74 in) (Btg horizons)
Abrupt textural change: 127 cm (50 in) (top of Btg horizon)
Albic materials: 10 to 127 cm (4 to 50 in) (E horizon)
Aquic conditions: 127 to 188 cm (50 to 74 in) (Btg horizons)

Additional comments: The subsoil is either gleyed (Btg horizons) or coarsely mottled with many prominent redox depletions with chroma 2 or less.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
