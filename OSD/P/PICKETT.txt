PICKETT SERIES

The Pickett series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift, metasedimentary bedrock, and volcanic ash. Pickett soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 5 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,015 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Andic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Pickett very gravelly loam, forested, on a northeast-facing sideslope of 45 percent at 380 meters elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. When described on August 19, 2004 the soil was moist throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lydon, Lyre, McElroy, Ovall, Schneider, Siouxon, and Yedlick series. Lydon soils formed in weathered tephra over residuum and colluvium weathered from igneous rock, have a mean annual soil temperature ranging from 11 to 15 degrees C, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 60 days. Lyre soils formed in glacial outwash and are very deep. McElroy soils are very deep, have an umbric epipedon, and formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt. Ovall soils formed in glacial drift mixed with residuum and colluvium from andesite and breccia, and have an umbric epipedon. Schneider and Siouxon soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact and have an umbric epipedon. Yedlick soils do not have a lithic contact, are formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt, and are dry in the soil moisture control section for 60 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pickett soils occur on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent and elevations range from 0 to 732 meters. These soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift, bedrock of metasedimentary lithology, and volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters with intermittent snow cover. The annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1,140 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free season is 160 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Constitution, Kahboo, Skipjack, and Kickerville series. Constitution soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and occur on adjacent hillslopes and mountain slopes. Kahboo soils have a lithic contact between 25 and 50 cm and occur on summits, hillslopes, and mountain slopes. Skipjack soils do not have a lithic contact, have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and occur on adjacent hillslopes and mountain slopes. Kickerville soils formed in loess and glacial outwash, do not have a lithic contact, and occur on outwash terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat, homesites, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation consists of western hemlock, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, Cascade Oregongrape, prickly currant, false Solomons-seal, swordfern, and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Washington; MLRA A2, Northern Part. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Juan County, Washington, 1956. The name is taken from Mount Pickett on Orcas Island.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon 
Andic subgroup properties - 3 to 69 cm (A and Bw1 horizons)
Cambic horizon - 8 to 91 cm (Bw horizons)
