PADUCAH SERIES

The Paducah series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in silty redbeds of Permian age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on hillslopes and terraces on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).

Cobb and Decobb soils: have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: alluvium and/or residuum derived from calcareous fine grained sandstone or siltstone, mainly in the Quartermaster, Cloud Chief, and Whitehorse formations of the Permian redbeds
Landscape: dissected plains
Landform: convex surfaces on hillslopes and terraces
Slope: 0 to 5 percent, but mainly 1 to 3 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 635 mm (20 to 25 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carey, Deepwood, Lutie, Obaro, Quinlan, St. Paul, and Woodward series.
Carey, Lutie, and St. Paul soils: occur on similar to lower base slopes/terraces or broad ridgetops, and have a mollic epipedon.
Deepwood soils: occur on similar to higher footslopes and side slopes, do not have an argillic horizon, and have a coarse-silty particle-size control section.
Obaro and Woodward soils: occur on side slopes and narrow convex ridgetops, do not have an argillic horizon, and are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) deep to bedrock.
Quinlan soils: occur on side slopes and narrow convex ridgetops, do not have an argillic horizon, and are less than 51 cm (20 in) deep to bedrock

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for growing cotton, grain sorghums, and small grains.  Native grasses are sideoatsgrama, blue grama, black grama, buffalograss, sand dropseed and Texas wintergrass.  Mesquite is a common invader on some sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Texas and possibly western Oklahoma; Land Resource Region - H; Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C).  The series extent is moderate.
