COMPETING SERIES: There are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: earth hummocks on outwash plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly outwash
Elevation: 2,674 to 3,018 feet (815 to 920 m)
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 35 inches (712 to 894 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Waitabit soil. Waitabit soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the coarse-silty layer and high to very high in the sandy or sandy-skeletal layer.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is shrub birch-bog blueberry scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
