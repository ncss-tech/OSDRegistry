PORTNEUF SERIES

The Portneuf series consists of deep and very deep, well-drained, moderately to moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium.  They are on fan terraces, terrace side slopes, basalt plains and hillsides, and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Portneuf silt loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; very weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and
slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--9 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; very weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; few cicada krotovinas in the lower part; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bkq1--13 to 27 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many dead roots on faces of peds; many very fine tubular pores; common hard, firm or very firm cicada krotovinas and subrounded nodules; strongly effervescent, common fine veins and soft masses of lime and coatings on krotovinas; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

    Bkq2--27 to 42 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam,  grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; very weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; dead roots on faces of peds; common very fine tubular pores; common hard, firm or very firm cicada krotovinas and subrounded nodules with softer matrix between the krotovinas; strongly effervescent, few fine masses and veins of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick)

    C--42 to 64 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chijer and Hynes series.  Chijer soils have loam texture in the particle-size control section.  Hynes soils have a substratum at 40 to 60 inches that silty clay loam to very fine sandy loam texture.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Portneuf soils are on fan terraces, basalt plains, terrace sideslopes and hillsides.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,500 to 4,800 feet.  The soil formed in loess and silty alluvium from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches, the average annual air temperature is about 45 to 53 degrees F., and the frost free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bahem, Darkbull, Declo, Heglar, Kimama, Minidoka, Pocatello, Portino, Scism, Sluka, Trevino and Wheeler soils.  Bahem soils have less than 15 percent durinodes, and are less compact in the Bk horizon.  Darkbull soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Declo soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Heglar soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Kimama soils have a mollic epipedon.  Minidoka, Scism, and Sluka soils have duripans.  Pocatello and Wheeler soils lack calcic horizons.  Portino and Trevino soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches and less than 20 inches respectively.  Bahem, Darkbull, Declo, Kimama, Minidoka, Pocatello, Portino, Scism, Sluka, and Trevino soils are on basalt plains and fan terraces.  Heglar soils are on high fan terraces and hillsides.  Wheeler soils are on steep hillsides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow to medium runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Portneuf soils are used for irrigated crops and rangeland.  The main crops grown are potatoes, sugar beets, beans, small grains and hay.  The natural vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This series is extensive in southern Idaho.
