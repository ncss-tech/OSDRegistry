PEATROSS SERIES	

The Peatross series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Peatross soils occur on stream terraces or floodplain-steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm(14 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C(43 F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pescar and Dancehall series.  The Dancehall soils are on alluvial fans and contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section.   The Pescar soils are on floodplains, are poorly drained, and have subsoils with greater than 35 percent coarse fragments.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Duchesne County, Utah, 2016; The name is taken from an old historic homestead.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  the zone from 25 to 100 cm. (lower part Bwb1, Ab, Bwb2, Bwb3, and upper part of C2 horizon).
Mollic epipedon:  0 to 18 cm depth. (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon:  23 to 83 cm depth. (Bwb1, Ab, Bwb2, and Bwb3 horizons).

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
