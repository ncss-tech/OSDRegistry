PATIDIDIT SERIES

The Patididit series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, with additions of aeolian volcanic ash. Patididit soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Patididit soils are on stream terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, with additions of aeolian volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,955to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Twojayay series. Twojayay soils have secondary carbonates within 20 cm of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 75 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is common. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between December and November.

USE AND VEGETATION: Patididit soils are used for pastureland, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly rushes and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
