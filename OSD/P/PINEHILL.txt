PINEHILL SERIES

The Pinehill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Pinehill soils are on sedimentary plains, alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills, ridges and stream terraces.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Custer County, Montana; 1995. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1473.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 5 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 5 to 26 inches (Bt, Btk1, Btk2 horizons); a particle-size control section that is the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt, Btk1, Btk2 horizons); accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate excluding the argillic horizon (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).  Pinehill soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
