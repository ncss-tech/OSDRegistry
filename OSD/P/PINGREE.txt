PINGREE SERIES  

The Pingree series consists of very shallow, well drained  soils formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Pingree soils are on lava flows on slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Lithic Xeric Torriorthents  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pingree stony silt loam on a convex slope of 3 percent under rangeland at 5,000 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on June 5, 1979, the soil was dry throughout.)  

    A--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stony silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many fine vesicular pores; desert pavement present; 15 percent basalt gravel 3 percent basalt cobbles and 2 percent basalt stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)  

    Bw1--2 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; medium fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent basalt gravel and 5 percent basalt stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)  

    Bw2--7 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent basalt gravel, 15 percent basalt cobbles and 5 percent basalt stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt, wavy boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)  

    2R--9 inches; fractured basalt (fractures are 4 to 20 inches apart).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on lava plains at elevations from 4,500 to 5,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 80 to 110 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Argon, Bondfarm, Deuce, Polatis and Tenno soils.  The Argon and Polatis soils are moderately deep to basalt and are in concave positions.  The Bondfarm, Deuce, and Tenno soils are shallow to basalt.
  
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for wildlife habitat.   The principal native plants are Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and sandberg bluegrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho on the Snake River Plain.  The soils are inextensive.
