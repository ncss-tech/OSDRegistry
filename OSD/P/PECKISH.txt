PECKISH SERIES

The Peckish series consists of deep, very poorly drained,
rapidly permeable soils that formed in thick beds of sandy marine sediments in tidal swamps along the coast of Peninsular Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Typic Sulfaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Peckish mucky fine sand in a mangrove tidal
swamp.
                (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

     A11--0 to 4 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) mucky fine sand; massive; friable; 45 percent sulfur; 222 mmho/cm
conductivity; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

     A12--4 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) mucky fine sand; massive; friable; 13 percent sulfur; 59 mmho/cm
conductivity; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

     A13--6 to 9 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) mucky fine sand; massive; friable; 26 percent sulfur; 105 mmho/cm
conductivity; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 3
inches thick)

     A21--9 to 12 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) fine sand; single
grained; loose; many fine roots; 7 percent sulfur; 32 mmho/cm conductivity; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 33
inches thick)

     A22--12 to 25 inches; light gray (10YR 6/1) fine sand; few
light gray (10YR 7/1) streaks along old root channels; single grained; loose; few fine and medium roots; few pockets of organic material; 2 percent sulfur; 50 mmho/cm conductivity; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (11 to 18 inches thick)

     A23--25 to 36 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) fine sand; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and grayish brown (10YR 4/2) mottles; single grained; loose; 4 percent sulfur; 25 mmho/cm conductivity; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 11
inches thick)

     B2h--36 to 43 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sand; single grained; very friable; sand grains thinly coated with organic matter, many
uncoated sand grains; 3 percent sulfur; 29 mmho/cm conductivity; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

     B3&Bh--43 to 48 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) and dark brown (10YR 4/3) fine sand; common medium distinct very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2) mottles; single grained; very friable; many uncoated
sand grains 6 percent sulfur; 30 mmho/cm conductivity; very
strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

     C--48 to 61 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand; few fine distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) streaks along old root channels; single grained; loose; 4 percent sulfur; 27 mmho/cm conductivity; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lee County, Florida; about 0.7 mile southeast of intersection of State Highway 867 and Shell Point Blvd. and 150
feet south in the SE1/4NE1/4 sec. 11, T. 46 S., R 23 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sulfur content ranges from 2 to 45
percent within depths of 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the natural state, and
from extremely acid to neutral after drying.

The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or
value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 3; hue of 7.5YR, value of 3,
and chroma of 2; or hue of 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.
It is mucky fine sand or fine sand.

The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1
or 2; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 2.

The Bh horizon does not meet the requirements of a spodic horizon.  It has matrix color in hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of
2 or 3; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or is a
mixture of these colors.  Some pedons have a B3&BH or B3 horizon, where present, the color is in hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma
of 2, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3; or hue of 7.5YR, value of
5, and chroma of 3.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Shell fragments are in the C horizon in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Homosassa and Kesson series in the
same family.  Homosassa soils have hard limestone within depths of
20 to 40 inches and lack Bh horizons.  Kesson soils lack Bh
horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peckish soils are in tidal swamps and mashes.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  The soil formed in thick deposits
of sand.  Near the type location, mean annual precipitation is
about 55 inches and mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Myakka and Hallandale series.  Myakka soils lack appreciable amounts of sulfides within
120 inches of the surface and have spodic horizons.  Hallandale
soils have limestone less than 20 inches below the surface and
lack Bh horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Peckish soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is rapid.  Under natural conditions, the soil is flooded daily during normal high tides.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Peckish soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is black-mangrove, American mangrove
in swamps, and batis, saltwort, bushy sea-oxeye, marshhay
cordgrass, and seashore saltgrass in marshes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal tidal area of Peninsular
Florida.  The series is of small known extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lee County, Florida; 1982.

REMARKS:  This series was formerly mapped as tidal swamp,
mangrove.  This soil would classify as Spodic Sulfaquents if this subgroup were in taxonomy.
