PINEKNOT SERIES

The Pineknot series consist of very deep, well or moderately well drained soils formed in acidic loamy hillslope sediments over highly weathered clayey or gravelly clay residuum from dolomite. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on uplands of the Ozark Highlands. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual soil temperature is about 14 degrees Celsius. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 millimeters.

The Captina, Tonti, Scholten and Firebaugh soils have a fragipan or a fragic horizon and can occur within the same map unit or adjacent to the Pineknot series.  The Fanchon and Macedonia series are fine-loamy or fine particle size class and occur within the same map unit or adjacent to the Pineknot series.  The Clarksville, Coulstone and Poynor series are loamy-skeletal or loamy-skeletal over clayey particle size class and are on side slopes or adjacent to the Pineknot series.

USE AND VEGETATION:
These soils are used for the production of timber, wildlife habitat, and related natural resources.  Some areas are used for pasture and hayland.  Native vegetation is mixed conifer-deciduous woodlands.  The overstory in most areas consists of shortleaf pine, black oak, scarlet oak, white oak, post oak, pignut hickory, and black hickory. The understory contains blueberries, tick-trefoils, lespedezas, asters, goldenrods, mixed grasses, upland sedges and various other woodland forbs and vines indicative of acidic environments.

SERIES PROPOSED: Shannon County, Missouri, 2025.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section - the zone from a depth of 10 to 100 centimeters.
Series control section - 0 to 200 centimeters.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 5 to 33 centimeters (A, E, EA, AE, AB, BA, BE horizons).
Albic horizon, where present   the zone from 10 to 41 centimeters.
Argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 200 centimeters (Bt and 2Bt and 3Bt horizons).
Strongly contrasting particle size class (lithologic discontinuity) occurs at a depth of 39 centimeters for the typical pedon.  The range is from 28 to 76 centimeters and the average is 45 centimeters. 

The typical pedon has a base saturation of 17 percent at the critical depth.  The base saturation for this series ranges from 6 to 20 percent with an average of 12 percent.

Pineknot soils were previously mapped as Macedonia, Fanchon and Poynor series. Site and pedon ID 2017MO203204 represents the typical pedon.
