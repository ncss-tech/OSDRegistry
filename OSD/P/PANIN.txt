PANIN SERIES

Panin soils typically have dark grayish brown and grayish brown stony loam A1 horizons, and brown and pale brown extremely stony and gravelly clay loam B2t horizons underlain by rhyolite bedrock at depths of 22 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Panin stony loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very thin platy structure; soft, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    A2-- 4 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium and large roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; common very fine, and few fine and medium roots; few very fine interstitial, and few fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt2--17 to 22 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely stony clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine interstitial and tubular pores; common thin clay film on faces of ped and in pores; 35 percent stones; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear irregular boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    R--22 to 38 inches; weathered, fractured rhyolite bedrock with clay in cracks and pockets in the bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Pershing County, Nevada; approximately 18 miles southeast of Winnemucca in the Sonoma Range; approximately 2,100 feet north and 200 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 2, T.33 N., R.34 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The mean annual soil temperature  -  36 to 41 F.,

Mean summer soil temperature  -   54 to 59 F.

Depth to bedrock range from  - 20 to 36 inches.

Mollic epipedon -  16 to 20 inches thick.


A1 horizon: Hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.

Value:  4 or 5 dry.

Chroma:  2 or 3.


Bt horizon:  Hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.

Value:  5 or 6 dry,

Chroma:  3 or 4.

Structure:  Moderate or strong, fine or medium, angular or subangular blocky structure.

Texture:  Gravelly, cobbly, stony or extremely stony clay loam.

Clay content:  Averages 28 to 35 percent clay,

Rock fragment:  15 to 20 percent pebbles and 20 to 30 percent stones and cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Bickmore, Bluebell, Parkey, Woodcock, and Woodhurst series. Bickmore soils have calcic horizons. Bluebell soil are slightly to medium acid, have mollic epipedons 20 to 35 inches thick, and friable Bt horizons with 50 to 80 percent rock fragments. Parkay and Woodcock going lack bedrock within depths of 40 inches. Woodhurst going have granular A1 and Bt horizons, soft and friable Bt horizons, have more than 50 percent rock fragments, and have an ustic moisture regime.

SETTING: Panin soils are on strongly sloping to moderately steep convex mountain slopes at elevations of 7,000 to 9,000 feet. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from rhyolite, quartzite, and chert. The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 12 to 15 inches. The mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 F.; the mean January temperature is 18 to 22 F.; the mean July temperature is 55 to 60 F.; and the frost-free season is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Dryn, Percoun, Spin, and Tonin soils. These soils have more than 35 percent clay. Dryn soils have 40-to 60-inch thick sola, 10 to 16 inch thick mollic epipedons and 50 to 80 percent rock fragments. Spin soils have 10 to 16 inch thick mollic epipedons and lime accumulations below depths of 18 to 24 inches. Tonin soils have bedrock at depths of 12 to 20 inches and have 50 to 75 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium or rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is principally big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, snowberry, lupine, arrowleaf balsamroot, hawksbeard, thistle, eriogonum, squirreltail, Sandberg bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Nevada. The soils are of small extent.
