PATOUZA SERIES

The Patouza series consists of very deep, well drained  soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Patouza clay, in hayland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--4 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; few slickensides; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt2--11 to 16 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine,  fine and medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; few slickensides; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 14 inches thick)

    Btk--16 to 24 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common fine masses and seams of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary. ( 0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk--24 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified silty clay loam and fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine masses and seams of lime; strongly effervescent;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Patouza soils are used mainly for 
cropland, hayland and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation may include western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, big sagebrush and other perennial grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Patouza soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1449. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 11 inches (A, Bt1 horizon); an argillic horizon which is also the particle-size control section from 4 to 24 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation from 16 to 60 inches (Btk, Bk horizons). Patouza soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
