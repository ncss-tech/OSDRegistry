PATRICIA SERIES

The Patricia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on very gently to gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 457 mm (18 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Amarillo series. Similar soils include Brownfield, Delwin, Grandfield, Spantara, and Tokio series. 
Amarillo series: have a calcic horizon between 100 and 150 cm (40 and 60 in). 
Brownfield series: has a sandy particle-size class extending from the mineral soil surface to the top of an argillic horizon that is 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) thick. 
Delwin and Grandfield series: are dry for shorter periods of time. 
Spantara series: has a coarse-loamy particle-size class. 
Tokio series: has a calcic horizon from 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) from the soil surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Slopes: 0 to 5 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 406 to 533 mm (16 to 21 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Amarillo series and the Arvana, Brownfield, Midessa, Portales, Posey and Tokio series. 
Amarillo and Brownfield soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Arvana soils: are slightly on lower landscape positions and have a petrocalcic horizon within a depth of 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in).
Midessa and Portales soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and lack argillic horizons.
Posey soils: are on similar landscape positions, are calcareous throughout, and have a calcic horizon within 76 cm (30 in) of the soil surface.
Tokio soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a calcic horizon within 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) of the soil surface. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for cropland but also used as native rangeland. Principal crops grown are cotton and grain sorghum. Climax vegetation is tall and mid grasses, with tall grasses tending to dominate. This site is dominated by little and sand bluestem along with taller dropseed species. The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn. Sand sage, shinoak, and skunkbush are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077CY035TX) range site in MLRA-77. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern part of the High Plains of Texas and New Mexico (MLRA-77C). The soil is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lynn County, Texas; 1966. 

REMARKS: The Patricia series was formerly included in the Brownfield series as a thin surface phase. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in). (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 30 to 198 cm (12 to 78 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
Calcic horizon: 198 to 221 cm (78 to 87 in). (Btk horizon)
Note: The loamy textures generally are where deep plowing has mixed some of the underlying sandy clay loam with the overlying fine sand. The lower portion of the epipedon is designated as an E horizon in some pedons.
