PENAPON SERIES

The Penapon series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial-colluvial material derived from limestone.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Penapon very cobbly loam--forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

Texture:  loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent sand, with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments dominated by pebbles and cobbles Calcium carbonate equivalent:  15 to 40 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Zaster series. Zaster soils are moderately deep to San Andreas limestone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Penapon soils are on steep mountain slopes.  They formed in alluvial - colluvial material derived from limestone.  Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is about 100 to 140 days.  These soils are mainly on north aspect.  Precipitation occurs mainly as showers during July through September.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Docdee, Monjeau, Paco, and Tortugas soils.  Docdee soils are shallow and are in higher positions in the landscape than Penapon soils.  Monjeau soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches and are in higher positions in the landscape than Penapon soils.  Paco soils are in a fine family and are in lower positions in the landscape than Penapon soils.  Tortugas soils are shallow and are adjacent to Penapon soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Penapon soils are used for urban development, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation includes ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, big bluestem, little bluestem, and mountain muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Penapon soils are of small extent in the southcentral mountains of New Mexico. MLRA 39.
