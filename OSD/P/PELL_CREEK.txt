PELL CREEK SERIES

The Pell Creek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous, loamy till. These soils are on plane or slightly concave slopes on ground moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

Drainage class--poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.15 and 0.45 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is both perched and apparent

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters. 

Diagnostic horizons and properties recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 51 centimeters (Ap, A and AB horizons); 
cambic horizon--the zone from 51 to 203 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2, BCkg, BC1, and BC2 horizons); 
aquic moisture regime.

Episaturation based on field observations and brighter colored matrix in the lower part of the profile.

Some pedons have a sandy or coarse-loamy lag line, about 10 centimeters thick, with or without gravel at the contact with the underlying firm till.

The BC horizon is defined by having prismatic primary structure parting to angular or subangular blocky.  This structure is evident in pits and cutbanks and rarely observed by smaller scale investigations. The change in moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.65 g/cc was based on lab data of soils that are similar and field investigations by soil scientist in this geomorphic landform of the Coteau des Prairies bench".

Based on current investigations, elevation range in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meters above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296, has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
