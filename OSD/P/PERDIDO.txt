PERDIDO SERIES

The Perdido series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in loamy marine sediments of the Southern Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Plinthic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Perdido sandy loam on a 3 percent slope in an idle field. (Colors are for moist soil.)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) sandy loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common medium, fine, and very fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 27 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium and fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

    Bt2--27 to 45 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; 
few fine roots; common faint clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 
(11 to 25 inches thick)

    Btv--45 to 57 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common faint clay films on faces of peds; about 10 percent by volume of nodular plinthite; common medium distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 37 inches thick)

    B't1--57 to 72 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay 
loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint clay films faces of peds; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary; (11 to 20 inches thick)

    B't2--72 to 80 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; few fine distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) iron depletions; strongly acid.
TYPE LOCATION:  Escambia County, Florida; approximately 
1420 feet south and 50 feet east of the northwest corner 
of Sec. 10, T. 5 N., R. 31 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is greater than 80 inches.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the profile, except for surface layers that have been limed.  Depth to the Btv horizon ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Silt content in the particle-size control section is more than 20 percent.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  It is 4 to 9 inches thick.

Some pedons have an EB or BE horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.

The upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The lower part has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

The Btv horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, and gray range from few to common.  Content of nodular plinthite ranges from 5 to 15 percent by volume.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

The B't horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and gray range from few to common.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

The BC horizon, present in some pedons, has the same range in color as the B't horizon, or it has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, and gray.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brogdon, Compass, and Poarch series.  Brogdon soils are bisequal.  Compass soils have less than 20 percent silt in the particle-size control section, and have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet.  Poarch soils do not have hues redder than 10YR in the Bt and Btv horizons, and have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 4.0 feet.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Perdido soils are on nearly level 
to sloping uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain.  Slopes 
range from 0 to 12 percent.  They formed in loamy marine sediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 69 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 56 to 66 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Poarch soils and the Lucy, Red Bay, and Troup soils.  Lucy and Troup soils are on adjacent side slopes.  They have a thick sandy epipedon.  Poarch and Red Bay soils are on similar positions as Perdido soils.  Red Bay soils are fine-loamy and have rhodic colors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slowly permeable.  A seasonal high water table is perched at a depth of 4 to 6 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas have been cleared and are
used for cultivated crops, pasture, and hayland.  The main cultivated crops are corn, wheat, soybeans, and truck crops.  Some areas have been planted to slash pine. Natural vegetation consists of slash pine, longleaf pine, southern red oak, water oak, white oak, sweetgum, hickory, and yaupon.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Upper Coastal Plain of Florida.  The series is of small extent.
