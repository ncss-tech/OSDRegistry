SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska; 2020

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 39 to 114 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Aquic conditions--C horizon
*Redoximorphic iron concentrations--C horizon
*Redoximorphic iron depletions--C horizon
*Permafrost--Cf horizon
Organic horizons are saturated for more than 30 days (cumulative) in normal years, and do not meet the criteria for a folistic epipedon.
