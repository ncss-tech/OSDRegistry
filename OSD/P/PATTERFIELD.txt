PATTERFIELD SERIES

The Patterfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Patterfield soils are on flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustifluventic Haplocambids

Cambic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 36 cm.  (Bw horizons)
Gypsum accumulations:  In the zone from 114 to 173 cm.  (Cy horizon)
Salt accumulations:  In the zone from 36 to 58 cm.  (Cz horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 173 cm.  (Cr horizon)
