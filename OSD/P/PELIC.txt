PELIC SERIES

The Pelic series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Pelic soils are on flood plains and oxbows.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pelic sand--wet meadow. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

TYPE LOCATION:  Churchill County, Nevada; in the Lahontan Valley about 8.25 miles southeast of Fallon; approximately 1,225 feet east and 1,134 feet south of the northwest corner of section 2, T. 17 N., R. 29 E.; USGS Carson Lake 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 22 minutes 12 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 42 minutes 9 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.3700000 latitude, -118.702500 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture; Saturated with water during most years from the soil surface to about 50 cm; aquic or peraquic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent in the A and upper Cg horizons, noneffervescent in the lower Cg horizons.
Other features: Root mats (up to 5 cm thick) are present in some pedons where the water table is within 8 cm of the soil surface during most of the year.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 0 to 5 percent.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR through 5Y.
Value: 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry.
Chroma:  1 or 2, moist or dry.
Redoximorphic features:  Occur as few to many, fine to coarse redox concentrations of iron with reddish hue or high chroma.
Structure: Single grain or massive, or has weak or moderate, very thin to medium platy structure.
Consistence: Loose or soft in sandy strata and slightly hard or very hard in clayey strata.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Salinity (EC): 0 to 32 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 1 to 12.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 3 percent.

Cg horizons
Hue: 10YR through 10Y moist; ranges to 5B or N (neutral) with depth.  The hue changes rapidly on exposure to air and dry hue is 2.5Y or 5Y.
Value: 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry.
Chroma:  0 (when hue is N) or 1 moist, 0 (when hue is N) through 2 dry.
Texture: Dominantly sand or coarse sand; Strata up to 15 cm thick of sandy loam to clay are common; thick continuous dense strata of lacustrine clay are common below 100 cm.
Clay content: 0 to 12 percent.
Redoximorphic features: Occur as redox concentrations of iron with reddish or yellowish hue with high chroma or redox depletions of bluish or greenish hue with low chroma.
Salinity (EC): 4 to 32 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 1 to 5.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 3 percent.
Other features:  An odor of methane gas can be detected emitting from the lower Cg horizons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Almeria series.  Almeria soils are less affected by soluble salts and sodium and have mean annual temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pelic soils are on flood plains and oxbows on delta plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks such as granite, basalt, and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,250 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the East Fork, Fallon, and Sagouspe soils.  These soils are not saturated with water high in the soil profile.  In addition, East Fork soils are fine-loamy and Fallon soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very rapid permeability.  These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from February through May with water up to 30 cm foot deep.  These soils are susceptible to frequent flooding for long periods between April and October.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pelic soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is inland saltgrass and wiregrass in the more salt-affected areas where the water table is somewhat lower or Baltic rush, bluejoint reedgrass, and cattails in the less salt-affected areas where the water table is at the soil surface or the surface is ponded.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.
