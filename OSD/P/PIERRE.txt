PIERRE SERIES

The Pierre series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey residuum, or local alluvium over residuum, derived from shale bedrock.  Pierre soils are on gently sloping to rolling hillslopes on uplands on the Pierre Shale Plains (MLRA 60A).  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Torrertic Haplustepts

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to very low saturated hydraulic conductivity; high to very high runoff, depending on slope.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily as rangeland. Native grasses are mainly western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, sideoats grama, blue grama, buffalograss, and forbs. A few isolated areas are cropped, and a few areas are utilized for hayland and pasture. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Pierre shale plains in western South Dakota, northeastern Wyoming, and northwestern Nebraska; LRR G, MLRA 60A.  Pierre is still correlated in a few non-MLRA subets of MLRA 63A in west-central South Dakota.  The series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Belle Fourche area, South Dakota, 1907.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 inches); (A horizon)
Cambic horizon - 13 to 66 cm (5 to 26 inches); (Bw and Bk horizons)
Identifiable secondary carbonates - 49 to 66 cm (19 to 26 inches); (Bk and BCk horizons)
Paralithic contact - at 79 cm (31 inches); (upper boundary of Cr horizon)
Paralithic materials- 79 to 200 cm (31 to 80 inches); (Cr horizon)

The series taxonomic class is changed to Torrertic Haplustepts.  Field observations of Pierre soils failed to reveal the presence of slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates associated with Vertisols.

The typical pedon for the series is moved from Haakon County, South Dakota (MLRA 63A) to Custer County (MLRA 60A) with this update.  MLRA 63A is typic-ustic.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Twenty-three pedons are in the KSSL database.  Many of these are grab samples.  None are from the type location.  Two complete samples are lab pedon id 87P0525 (field pedon id 87SD103001), and lab pedon id 40A2437 (field pedon id 57SD113009).
