POLLOW SERIES

The Pollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from conglomerate and sandstone.  Pollow soils are on canyon ledges.  Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pollow, on a Northwest facing, 15 percent slope under pinyon and ponderosa at an elevation of 2,270 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 16, 2005 the soil was dry.  The surface is covered by 5 percent boulders, 5 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 12 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) bouldery fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent boulders, 3 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt--12 to 20 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay films in pores and on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.

    Btk--20 to 38 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4)  gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay films in pores and on faces of peds; few fine calcium carbonate threads and coats on bottom of rock fragments (2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 15 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 30 cm thick)

    Bk--38 to 56 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; many calcium carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments, (22 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    R--56 to 66 cm; Conglomerate bedrock.  

TYPE LOCATION:  Emery County, Utah; located on the east part of Cedar Mountain; located about 1,800 feet west and 250 feet north of the SE corner of sec. 6, T. 19 S., R. 12 E.; Chimney Rock USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 11 minutes 34 seconds N. and long. 110 degrees 36 minutes 41 seconds W., NAD 83

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alire, Banquito, Brumley, Goesling, Maia, Normrah and Todest series. Alire, Brumley, Goesling Maia and Normrah soils are all very deep soils. Banquito soils are moderately deep to basalt. Todest soils have mean annual soil temperatures higher than 10 degrees C, have calcareous A horizons and have a calcic horizon with a calcium carbonate equivalent of over 40 percent overlying limestone.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and conglomerate
Landform:  canyon ledges
Slopes:  5 to 35 percent
Elevation:  2,012 to 2,316 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 8.9 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  30.5 to 40.6 cm
Precipitation pattern: peak periods from July to October and has even distribution throughout the remainder of the year
Frost-free period:  110 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bobknoll, Colskel, Neto and Wimmer series.  The Bobknoll and Wimmer soils lack argillic horizons and are on sagebrush flats.  The Colskel soils are shallow to bedrock and are on canyon side slopes.  The Neto soils are very deep and are in alluvial drainage ways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate to high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing of cattle and wildlife: Pinyon and ponderosa pines, Utah juniper, blue grama, Indian ricegrass and blue grasses, Wyoming big sagebrush and snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern, Utah; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.
