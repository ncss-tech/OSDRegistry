PALBOONE SERIES

The Palboone series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed schist, gneiss, and/or granite.  Palboone soils are on mountainsides and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, micaceous Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Palboone loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; partially decomposed organic material mainly bark, twigs, and needles.

    A--5 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    E1--13 to 26 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    E2--26 to 54 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 30 cm thick)

    B/E--54 to 72 cm; 60 percent brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist (Bt); 40 percent light gray (10YR 7/2), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist (E); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt1--72 to 95 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse angular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many thick clay films on ped faces; few medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bt2--95 to 133 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common thick clay films on ped faces; few medium roots; weak, neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons - 55 to 65 cm thick)

    Bt3--133 to 158 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; neutral (pH 6.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Ashcroft series.  Ashcroft soils have hues of 5YR and redder.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform--mountainsides and ridges
Elevation--2250 to 2600 meters
Slope--15 to 50 percent
Parent material--mixed schist, gneiss, and/or granite
Mean annual precipitation--480 to 610 mm
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 6 degrees C
Frost-free period--50 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for watershed, recreation, wildlife habitat, and timber production.  Principal native vegetation is Douglas-fir and mountain ninebark.  These soils also support scattered aspen with a grass understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Palboone soils are of small extent along the eastern front of mountains in Colorado; MLRA 48A.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Pike National Forest, East Part, Douglas County, Colorado, 1984.

REMARKS:  These soils have high contents of mica present which causes deception in estimations of field textures.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--5 to 13 cm (A horizon)
Albic horizon--13 to 54 cm (E1 and E2 horizons)
Glossic horizon--54 to 72 cm (B/E horizon)
Argillic horizon--54 to 158 cm (E/B, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Particle-size control section--72 to 122 cm (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.

Palboone soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime. 

Converted to metric and O horizons were updated to start at zero. Competing series section was not updated. 05/2023
