PUNCHBOWL SERIES

The Punchbowl series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from andesite, dacite, rhyolite, tuffs and minor areas of shale.  Punchbowl soils are on crests and side slopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Punchbowl loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with about 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; l5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--15 to 25 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores and few distinct clay films on ped faces; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    R--25 cm; fractured andesite; soft carbonate masses in fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 25 miles east of Austin; about 600 feet south and 600 feet east of northwest corner, section 4, T. l9 N., R. 47 E.; USGS Ackerman Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 32 minutes 47 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 41 minutes and 35 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5463889 latitude, -116.6930556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in mid-June through early November; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 20 to 36 cm.
Reaction:  Neutral through moderately alkaline, increasing with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  l8 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  l5 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Value:  4, 5, or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Carbonates:  Noneffervescent through strongly effervescent in the lower subhorizon.

B2t horizon
Hue:  7.5YR or l0YR.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4. Texture:  Gravelly loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam.
Clay content:  25 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  25 to 35 percent, mostly gravel.
Carbonates:  Noneffervescent through strongly effervescent in the matrix.  Some pedons have very thin carbonate coats on undersides of rock fragments or few soft carbonate segregations in lower part. Other features:  Few thin patchy colloid coats are common on rock fragments in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Coztur and Rockstop series.  

Coztur and Rockstop soils have hard bedrock at 36 to 50 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Punchbowl soils are on convex rounded hill sides and crests and on lower side slopes of mountains.  They formed in residuum derived from andesite, dacite, rhyolite, welded tuffs and minor areas of shale.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,830 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to l00 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buster, Fishlake, Locane, Pedoli, and Segura series.  Buster, Fishlake, and Pedoli soils lack a lithic contact within 50 cm.  Locane soils have a clayey-skeletal argillic horizons.  Segura soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, Indian ricegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 24 and 28B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lander County, Nevada, South Part, 1985.

REMARKS:  The name is from Diana's Punchbowl, a hotspring in Monitor Valley.  This revision slightly alters the series concept to conform with additional field data.  Rock fragments in the argillic horizon were increased to 25 to 35 percent.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Argillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 25 cm (Bt horizon).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 25 cm (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 25 cm (A1, A2, and Bt horizons).
