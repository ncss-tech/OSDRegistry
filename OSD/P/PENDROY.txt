PENDROY SERIES

The Pendroy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine material or in alluvium from shale uplands.  These soils are on alluvial fans, floodplains, stream terraces, and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON: Pendroy clay, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; very hard, friable, sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bss1--3 to 7 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; 1 to 3 inch wide vertical cracks that are 2 to 6 inches apart; continuous distinct slickensides that intersect at a 30 to 60 degree angle; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); diffuse wavy boundary.

    Bss2--7 to 30 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine pores; continuous distinct slickensides that intersect at a 30 to 60 degree angle; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); diffuse wavy boundary. (Combined Bss horizons 15 to 45 inches thick)

    Bssy--30 to 42 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; very firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; few distinct gray (2.5Y 5/0) and dark gray (2.5Y 4/0) moist; bands of clay; continuous distinct slickensides that intersect at a 30 to 60 degree angle; few fine seams of gypsum; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

    BCy--42 to 70 inches, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; many gray (N 5/ ) and dark gray (N 4/ ) bands of clay below 50 inches; common coarse seams and masses of gypsum; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Cascade County, Montana; 800 feet west and 110 feet north of SE corner of the SW 1/4 of sec. 18, T.22 N., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Depth to gypsum accumulations - 20 to 50 inches.

When dry these soils form cracks 1 to 4 inches wide at the surface that extend to depths of 20 inches or more, where they are still 1 cm or more wide.  A bedrock substratum phase is recognized.

COMPETING SERIES:

There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans; floodplains; stream terraces; lake plains.

Elevation - 2,600 to 4,200 feet.

Slope - 0 to 15 percent.

Parent material - clayey glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine material or in alluvium from sedimentary plains.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 100 to 135 days.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pendroy soils are used for dryland crops and as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly green needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and western and thickspike wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Pendroy soils are extensive on the glaciated plains in northern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cascade County, Montana, 1969.

REMARKS: Soil interpretation record:  MT0116, MT0848.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, Bss1 horizons); intersecting slickensides - between 3 and 42 inches and cracks more than 1 cm wide extending to 30 inches or more (Bss1, Bss2 horizons); particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (Bss2, Bss3 horizons); horizon of gypsum accumulation - from 30 to 70 inches (Bssy, BCy horizons).  Pendroy soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
