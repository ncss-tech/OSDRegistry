PADOVA SERIES


The Padova series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from gneiss and igneous rock sources. Padova soils are on foothills. Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Mollic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Padova sandy loam, on a sideslope of a hill under a cover of annual grasses and laurel sumac canopy, at an elevation of 531 meters. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 22 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) broken face sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky and weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 1 percent subangular gneiss cobbles and 5 percent subangular gneiss gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt1--22 to 39 centimeters; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky and weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 5 percent faint clay bridges between sand grains; 1 percent subangular gneiss cobbles and 5 percent subangular gneiss gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--39 to 60 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 8 percent subangular gneiss gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt3--60 to 85 centimeters; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 6 percent subangular gneiss gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt4--85 to 105 centimeters; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 20 percent subangular gneiss gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); diffuse wavy boundary.

 R--105 to 200 centimeters; indurated gneiss.

TYPE LOCATION: Los Angeles County, California, 34 degrees North latitude, 8 minutes, 47 seconds and 117 degrees, 42 minutes, 21 seconds West longitude, NAD83 - U.S.G.S Quad: Mount Baldy, California.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture:	The soil becomes moist below a depth of about 30 cm some time from October to December and remains moist in some part between depths of about 30 to 90 centimeters until April or May.
Soil Temperature: 16 to 20 degrees C. The soil temperature usually does not go below 8 degrees C.

Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent by volume.
Depth to lithic contact: Typically greater than 100cm. Bedrock has areas with fractures less than 10 cm apart, but the rock is still dominantly greater than strongly cemented.

Clay content: 18 to 34 percent.
Depth to argillic horizon: 11 to 85 centimeters from the surface.
Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline.
Surface Fragments: 5 to 20 percent.

A Horizons:

Texture: Clay loam, sandy clay, sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, loam.
Clay: 10 to 36 percent.
Rock fragments: 0 to 35 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bellyspring, Coarsegold, Hicksville, Olashes, Perkins, Pleasanton, Redsluff and Rescue soils. 
Bellyspring soils: have carbonates in the lower Bt and a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.
Coarsegold soils: have a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm and a 160 to 260 day frost free season.
Hicksville soils: have bleached sand grains in the lower Bt horizon.
Olashes soils: have slopes of 0 to 5 percent and are formed in alluvium weathered from mixed sources.
Perkins soils:  have slopes typically less than 9 percent and are formed in alluvium weathered from mixed sources.
Pleasanton soils: have greater than 15 percent rock fragments and are formed in alluvium.
Redsluff soils: have a gravelly or coarser substratum at a depth of 89 to 165 cm.
Rescue soils: has a paralithic contact at a depth of 100 to 200 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Setting: hills and foothills.
Slopes: 15 to 55 percent.
Parent material: residuum weathered from gneiss, granite or other igneous rocks.
Elevation: 180 to 899 meters.
Mean annual precipitation: 400 to 800 mm.
The mean annual temperature is 15 to 19 C.
Frost free season: 300 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blasingame, Cieneba, Fallbrook, Vista and Walong soils.
Blasingame soil: have a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm and are on similar landscape positions.
Cieneba soils: have a paralithic contact within a depth of 50 cm and occur on crests and shoulders of hills and spur ridges.
