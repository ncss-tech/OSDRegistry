PEDLEFORD SERIES

The Pedleford series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and eolian material reworked by water over basalt.  Pedleford soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pedleford very stony loam - on a 4 percent slope at an elevation of 5,160 feet in rangeland.  When described July 22, 1980, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very stony loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent basalt gravel, 10 percent basalt cobbles, and 30 percent basalt stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

 Bw--5 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent basalt gravel, 10 percent basalt cobbles, and 30 percent basalt stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.

 Bk1--13 to 29 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very stony silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent carbonate, finely disseminated throughout; 5 percent basalt gravel, 20 percent basalt cobbles, and 30 percent basalt stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bk2--29 to 33 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent carbonate, finely disseminated throughout; 5 percent basalt gravel, 35 percent basalt cobbles, and 15 percent basalt stones; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

    2R--33 inches; hard lime-coated basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buist, Conneridge, Dagan, Hondoho, Ireland, Jebo, Niarada and Tuckerdowns series.  Buist, Dagan, Hondoho, Niarada and Tuckerdowns soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Conneridge soils have more than 60 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Jebo soils have 7.5YR and 5YR colors in the B horizon.  Ireland soils have fragments in the soil of limestone, dolomite, and sandstone lithology

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pedleford soils are on basalt plains and buttes.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000 feet.  The soil formed in loess and eolian material reworked by water over basalt. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as winter snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature is about 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Cox, Deerhorn, McCarey, Molyneux, Rehfield, and Wildors soils.  Cox soils are less than 20 inches deep.  Deerhorn and Wildors soils have average annual soil temperatures warmer than 47 degrees F.  McCarey soils have an argillic horizon and has less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Molyneux soils have argillic horizons and are very deep.  Rehfield soils are deep and very deep and have average annual soil temperatures warmer than 47 degrees F.  Cox, Deerhorn, McCarey, and Wildors soils occur on convex positions on basalt plains and sides of buttes.  Molyneaux and Rehfield soils occur in drainageways and depressions on basalt plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained.  Runoff is slow to rapid.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is basin big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  The series is of limited extent.
