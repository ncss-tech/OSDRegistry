POORMAN SERIES

The Poorman series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material derived from metamorphic rocks with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. They are on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 1,015 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, micaceous, frigid Andic Hapludalfs

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aldermand, Brodeer, Grandad and Mushel series. Aldermand, Brodeer and Mushel soils are on mountain slopes and lack high amounts of mica in the substratum. Grandad soils are on mountain slopes and have an ash mantle greater than 35 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, western white pine and lodgepole pine with an understory of queencup beadlily, goldthread, bunchberry dogwood, longtube twinflower, common prince's pine, darkwoods violet, common snowberry, rocky mountain maple and Columbia brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho, Poorman soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
