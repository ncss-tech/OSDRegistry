PARDEE SERIES

The Pardee series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on terrace remnants and eroded fan remnants on hills. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 515 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Mollic Haploxeralfs

TYPE LOCATION: Amador County, California; 5.6 km (3.5 miles) northeast of Camanche and 2.6 km (1.6 miles) southwest of Buena Vista Peaks; about 1 km (0.6 mile) east of the intersection of Camanche Road and the Camanche Parkway North, about 0.5 km (0.3 miles) west and 0.2 km (0.1 mile) north of the southeast corner of sec. 25, T.5 N., R.9 E. USGS Topographic Quad: Ione, California. WGS84 38.2516670 latitude -120.9313889 longitude. UTM ZONE 10 681005 meters E 4235762 meters N NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil temperature: Mean annual soil temperature is 17 to 19 degrees C. and remains above 8 degrees throughout the year. The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. These soils have a thermic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to October. The soils have a xeric moisture regime.

Diagnostic features: 
Ochric epipedon thickness: 5 to 35 cm
Argillic horizon thickness: 13 to 40 cm
Depth to lithic contact: 25 to 50 cm

Particle size control section weighted average:
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent

Organic matter: greater than 1 percent throughout the upper 10 cm. 

Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.

Base saturation (by sum of cations) ranges from 65 to 75 percent.

Value: 4 or 5 dry; 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry; 2 to 4 moist
Texture: clay
Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Priestgrade and Stineway soils. Stineway soils have a hue of 10YR, are neutral to moderately alkaline, and are formed in metamorphic rock. Priestgrade soils have rock fragments in the soil profile that are typically channers and flagstones and are formed in metasedimentary rock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pardee soils are on and the summit, shoulder, and backslope positions on terrace remnants, eroded fan remnants. Where there is mound and swale topography, Pardee soils occur on the mound positions. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. They formed in dark metamorphic and quartzitic gravelly and cobbly alluvium from mixed sources overlying unrelated volcaniclastic or metamorphic bedrock. Elevation ranges from 35 to 320 meters. Climate is Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 465 mm to 660 mm. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 17 degrees C. Mean January air temperature is about 8 degrees C, and mean July air temperature is 25 to 26 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 325 to 355 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amador, Auburn, Corning, Pentz, Ranchoseco and Redding soils. Amador, Auburn and Pentz soils are on hillslopes and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Corning and Redding soils are on similar positions and have less than 35 percent rock fragments, and more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ranchoseco soils are less than 25 cm to a lithic contact and are in the swales between mounds.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the soil. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is low to moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for rangeland. Vegetation is annual grasses and forbs with scattered blue oaks at higher elevations. Understory species include wild oat, bromes, soft chess, stork's bill, foxtail fescue, Mediterranean barley, and smooth cat's ear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. These soils are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Amador County, California 1963. Source of the name is Camp Pardee, an unincorporated community in California.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (A1 and A2 horizon).
Argillic horizon: 23 to 46 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizon).
Lithic contact: 46 cm (2R horizon)
Particle size control section for this pedon: 23 to 46 cm

This pedon was sampled by the SCS Riverside Laboratory in 1960 as pedon number 60 CA-3-22-(1-6) and is published in the California SSIR No. 24, pages 70 and 71. It was also sampled in Sacramento County as S82 CA 067-004. Where there is very slight hummocky microrelief, a complex has not been mapped (Amador County). Where there is strong hummocky microrelief a mound, intermound complex has been mapped with Pardee soils occurring on the mound position and Ranchoseco soils in the intermound position (Sacramento and Yuba counties). Soils with solum thickness greater than 50 cm have been excluded in this revision. 

Edit notes 12/2018 

The OSD pedon was described with a consolidated C horizon composed of andesitic conglomerate. Although this is the case, this horizon has been treated as a lithic contact in the series and component where this pedon is used as representative. Future investigations should evaluate if the bedrock is cemented at the type location and across its mapped extent. 

MLRA assignment changed from 17 (Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys) to 18 (Sierra Nevada Foothills) because this is a bedrock-controlled soil in a bedrock-dominated landscape, which conforms to the definition of MLRA 18.
