PERMA SERIES

The Perma series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and outwash. These soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces, outwash plains, inset fans, alluvial fans, fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, escarpments, moraines, hills and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Perma gravelly loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A1--0 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. 

    A2--15 to 30 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons - 18 to 38 cm) 

    Bw1--30 to 55 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; 35 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--55 to 91 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bw horizons - 16 to 90 cm) 

    BC--91 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).
