POKERGAP SERIES

The Pokergap series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks including loess and volcanic ash. The Pokergap soils are on fan piedmont remnants and mountain valley fans.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.
