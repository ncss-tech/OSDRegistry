POLSON SERIES

The Polson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces on glaciated uplands and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Natrixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Polson silt loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(4 to 15 inches thick)

    BC--24 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam with thin (about 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick) brown (10YR 5/3) clay varves, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine pores; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Polson soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces on glaciated uplands and dissected lake plains.  Elevations are 2,900 to 3,300.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in silty glacial and lacustrine deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs and falls; and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gird and Kerl series. These soils do not have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as irrigated and dry cropland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Intermountain valleys of western Montana.  It is of small extent.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0663.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); a transitional thin albic horizon from 7 to 10 inches (E/Btn horizon); natric horizons from 10 to 26 inches (Btn, Bkn1, Bkn2, and part of BCn horizons); and a fine-silty particle-size control section from 10 to 15 inches (Btn horizon).  Polson soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
