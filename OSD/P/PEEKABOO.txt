PEEKABOO SERIES

The Peekaboo series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and eolian sands derived from Navajo sandstone. Peekaboo soils are on dunes on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Siliceous, mesic Typic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Peekaboo loamy fine sand, 10 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 4620 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered be 2 percent gravel.

       A--0 to 3 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine platy structure parting to single grain ; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; noneffervescent, neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

       C--3 to 22 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; noneffervescent, neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 35 inches thick)

       R--22 inches; Navajo Formation sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Kane County, Utah; about 2 miles southeast of the Dry Fork Coyote Trailhead to Peekaboo and Spooky Canyons; located about 2,000 feet south and 400 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 31, T. 38 S., R. 7 E.; Big Hollow Wash USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 28 minutes 2 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 10 minutes 43 seconds W., NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture- Typic aridic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature 54 to 59 degrees F

Depth to lithic contact - 20 to 40 inches to Navajo sandstone

Particle-size control section (weighted average):

Clay content: 1 to 5 percent

Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent, dominantly gravel sized Navajo sandstone

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand
Clay content: 1 to 5 percent
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Spooky (UT) and Ranion (UT) series. 
Spooky soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to Navajo sandstone bedrock. 
Ranion soils are very deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum and eolian sands derived from Navajo sandstone
Landform: dunes on structural benches
Slopes: 2 to 30 percent
Elevation: 3,800 to 5,200 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 52 to 57 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 6 to 9 inches
Frost-free period: 160 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Suzipon, Spooky and Ranion series. The Suzipon soils are less than 20 inches deep over Navajo sandstone. The Spooky soils are 40 to 60 inches deep over Navajo sandstone. The Ranion soils are more than 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained, very low to low runoff, rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for rangeland, wildlife habitat and recreation. Potential native vegetation is four-wing saltbush, sand sagebrush, Cutler Mormon-tea, Indian ricegrass, sand dropseed and gooseberryleaf globemallow. These soils have been correlated to the Desert Sand (Sand Sagebrush) 035XY115UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-Central Utah. The soils of this series are of small extent (less than 10,000 acres). MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kane County, Utah, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument soil survey area, 2004. The name Peekaboo is from a nearby slot canyon.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 3 inches. (AC horizon)

Lithic contact: The contact with Navajo sandstone at 22 inches. (R horizon)

Siliceous mineralogy - soils formed directly from Navajo sandstone contains more than 90 percent silica minerals (dominantly quartz).
