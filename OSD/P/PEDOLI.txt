PEDOLI SERIES

The Pedoli series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Pedoli soils are on fan remnants and beach terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pedoli gravelly fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Btk--38 to 64 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; many faint and few distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; secondary carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 53 cm thick)

    Bqk1--64 to 89 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel; secondary silica and carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (20 to 36 cm thick)

    Bqk2--89 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel; secondary silica and carbonate coats on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 8 miles north of Eureka in Diamond Valley; at the north quarter corner of section 33, T.  21 N., R. 54 E.; USGS North of Eureka 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 39 minutes 3 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 53 minutes 56 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.6508333 latitude, -115.8988889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring, dry June through October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to argillic horizon: 8 to 25 cm.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 40 to 76 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 25 to 35 percent. 
Rock fragments: 10 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizons
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, the value is 6 dry and 4 moist when the upper 18 cm of the soil are mixed.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt and Btk horizons
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture:  Loam or clay loam.  
Rock fragments: 10 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or angular blocky.
Consistence:  Slightly hard or hard.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Bqk horizons
Value: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture:  Stratified gravelly loam to extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.
Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 50 percent gravel, ranges 35 to 65 percent..
Consistence:  Soft to hard, dry.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.  
Identifiable secondary carbonates: Coats are commonly present on bottom of rock fragments; Some pedons have soft masses in the horizon matrix.
Secondary silica: Coats are commonly present on bottom of rock fragments; Some pedons have up to 20 percent durinodes in subhorizons below 100 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Credo and Favret series. 

Credo soils have argillic horizons with upper boundaries between 36 and 50 cm from the soil surface and have lower boundaries between 76 and 100 cm.  Favret soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pedoli soils are on fan remnants and beach terraces.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations are 1,530 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Holtle, Nayped, Ratto, and Shipley soils.  Holtle soils have a mollic epipedon and lack an argillic horizon.  Nayped soils have a cambic horizon. Ratto soils have a clay Bt horizon and duripan.  Shipley soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pedoli soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Some areas are used for irrigated cropland with small grains and alfalfa as the principal crops.  The native vegetation in rangeland is Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Nevada ephedra, and scattered Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada and central Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 12 and 28B.
