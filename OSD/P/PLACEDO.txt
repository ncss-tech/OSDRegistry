PLACEDO SERIES

The Placedo series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, very slowly permeable, ponded soils that have formed in saline, alkaline, clayey alluvium near sea level. These nearly level soils occur on flood plains. Slope ranges from  0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, nonacid, hyperthermic Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Placedo silty clay--rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ag2--20 to 64 cm (8 to 25 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak medium angular blocky structure; very firm, extremely sticky and plastic; common fine roots; few fine roots; strongly saline; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (30 to 61 cm [12 to 24 in] thick)

     Ag3--64 to 91 cm (25 to 36 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; weak coarse angular blocky structure; very firm, very sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few fine faint olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) masses of oxidized iron; strongly saline; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 51 cm [10 to 20 in] thick)

     Cg1--91 to 127 cm (36 to 50 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; massive; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few thin strata of fine sandy loam; strongly saline; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Cg horizons is 81 to 164 cm [32 to 65 in] thick)

     Cg2--127 to 203 cm (50 to 80 in); gray (10YR 5/1) loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable; few thin strata of fine sandy loam and clay; strongly saline; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:   There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Aransas, Austwell, Barrada, Harris, Ijam, Surfside, Swan, Tracosa and Veston series.  
Aransas soils:  vertic properties.  
Austwell soils:  cambic horizon;  water table is below 61 cm (24 in) for extended periods.  
Barrada soils:  a salic horizon.  
Harris, Surfside, and Swan soils:  mollic colored epipedon. 
Ijam soils: vertic properties; forming in dredge material  
Trascosa soils: do not have  stratification; are subject to daily tidal flooding.  
Veston soils: are in a fine-silty family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: clayey over loam Holocene age alluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rock
Landscape: delta plains or low coastal plains
Landform: flood plains
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1092 mm (37 to 43 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the spring and fall months.
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 40 to 64
Mean annual air temperature: 20.6 to 21.7 degrees C (69 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 275 to 300 days
Elevation: near sea level to 3 m (0 to 10 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Aransas, Follet, Ijam, Swan, Tracosa and Veston series.  
Aransas, Ijam, and Veston: are on a slightly higher landform.  Follet, Tracosa, and Swan soils:  on a similar landform.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; runoff is negligible or the soil is ponded; very slow permeability.  A water table fluctuates from above the soil surface to about 30 cm (12 in) below the surface in normal years. Following rains the soils are flooded by fresh water.  Tides frequently flood the soils with sea water.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife.  Native vegetation includes marshhay cordgrass, smooth cordgrass, gulf cordgrass, bushy sea-oxeye, seashore saltgrass, spiny aster, shoregrass, sedges, and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Flood plains of rivers and small streams near sea level in the central part of the gulf coast of Texas. LRR-T; MLRA- 150B (Gulf Coast Saline Prairies); moderate extent.
