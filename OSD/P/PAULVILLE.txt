PAULVILLE SERIES

The Paulville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium and lacustrine sediments.  They are on terraces, basalt plains and buttes, with slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Paulville loam, cultivated - on a 2 percent slope, northwest aspect, at 3,780 feet elevation.  (When described on October 10, 1986, the profile was slightly moist throughout.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Ap2--3 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7/6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--17 to 31 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7/6); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk1--31 to 40 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--40 to 47 inches; lightly yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk3--47 to 64 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ackelton, Dixie, Harsan, Sevey and Woozle (T) series.  Ackelton and Harsan soils have a duripan at 40 to 60 inches.  Dixie soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments throughout the argillic horizon.  Woozle soils are deep to sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Paulville soils are on terraces, basalt plains and buttes.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium and lacustrine sediments. Elevations range from 2,800 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual temperature is about 46 to 51 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 to 11 inches.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Banbury, Emberton, Escalante, Owinza, Portneuf, Suepert, and Trevino soils and the competing Harsan series.  Banbury and Trevino soils are shallow to basalt.  Portneuf soils lack an argillic horizon, and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Emberton soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Escalante soils have sandy textures throughout.  Owinza soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Suepert soils are moderately deep to a hardpan and have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Banbury, Emberton, and Suepert soils are on higher terraces than Paulville.  Owinza soils are in depressions.  Portneuf soils are on basalt plains and higher terraces.  Trevino soils are on basalt ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow or medium runoff.  Moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Paulville soils are used for irrigated cropland, pastureland and rangeland.  The principal crops grown are alfalfa hay, dry beans, wheat, barley, sugar beets and potatoes.  The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral Idaho.  This soil is moderately extensive.
