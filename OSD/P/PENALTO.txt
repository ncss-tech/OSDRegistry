PENALTO SERIES

The Penalto series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained moderately permeable soils over a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  They formed in gravelly slope alluvium from limestone.  These soils are on hills.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture: Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.  The moisture control section is usually dry in some or all parts six-tenths or more of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.

Mean annual soil temperature:  55 to 59 degrees F.
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  10 to 20 inches
Depth to petrocalcic horizon:  10 to 20 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  40 to 60 percent (<20 mm fraction)
Coarse fragment content:  35 to 60 percent

Ak horizons
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist
Coarse fragments: limestone fragments; 35 to 60 percent total fragments; 20 to 30 percent gravel; 15 to 30 percent cobbles

Bkm horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Penasco (NM) series.  Similar soils are the Cuate (NM), and Pena (NM) series. 
Penasco soils: occur in a treeless vegetative zone at lower elevations and have a calcic horizon above the petrocalcic horizon.    
Cuate soils: moderately deep and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.
Pena soils: do not have a petrocalcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material:  gravelly slope alluvium
Landform:  hills
Slope: 5 to 65 percent
Mean annual temperature: 54 to 58 degrees
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 16 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 130 to 170 days
Elevation: 5,500 to 6,800 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deama and Modeama series.  
The Deama soils are shallow to bedrock and are on similar positions.
The Modeama soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderate above the petrocalcic horizon.  Runoff is very high.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is of the pinyon-juniper savannah type consisting of pinyon, oneseed juniper, alligator juniper, algertia, oak, mountain mahogany, hairy grama, sideoats grama, wolftail, curlyleaf muhly, pinyon ricegrass, beargrass, and prickly pear cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico; LRR G, MLRA 70.  The series is of minor extent.
