PASSMORE SERIES 

The Passmore series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from  mixed sources over coarse alluvium from granite or other coarse grained, igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on floodplains and drainageways in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Passmore mucky peat in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(8 to 24 inches thick)

    BC--24 to 34 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 2 percent fine subangular gravel; few fine dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 20 inches thick)

    2C--34 to 72 inches; variegated pale brown (10YR 6/3) and light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, non-sticky, and non-plastic; abundant interstitial pores; 35 percent, mainly fine, gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - floodplains and drainageways
Elevation - 5,180 to 7,960 feet
Slope - 0 to 8 percent
Parent material - alluvium from mixed sources over coarse alluvium from granite or other coarse grained, igneous or metamorphic rocks
Climate - long cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 35 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

These are the Valleyflat, Cometcrik, and Pitchstone series.  Valleyflat soils are well drained and shallow to sand and gravel.  They occur in valley floor areas, above the floodplain.  Cometcrik soils are poorly drained, have a weighted average of 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section and occur in lower floodplain positions. Pitchstone soils are well drained and occur on gently sloping fans and footslopes adjacent to the floodplain.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability in upper horizons over rapid permeability in underlying coarse substrates. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Passmore soils are primarily used for rangeland, pasture, and as wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly slender wheatgrass, slender cinquefoil, Baltic rush, giant goldenrod, woods rose, shrubby cinquefoil, and Douglas sedge along with substantial amounts of naturalized redtop and Kentucky bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Passmore soils are of limited extent in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana.
