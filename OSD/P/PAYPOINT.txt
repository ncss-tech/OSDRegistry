PAYPOINT SERIES

The Paypoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from tuff over lacustrine deposits derived from basalt.  Paypoint soils are on lagoons.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Paypoint soils are on lagoons.  They formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from tuff over lacustrine deposits derived from basalt.  Eolian material influenced by volcanic ash is also a component of the parent material in the upper part of the profile.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,680 to 1,770 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 25o mm, the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Corral, Davey, and Langston soils.  Corral soils are loamy, shallow to soft bedrock, and have argillic horizons.  Davey soils are sandy, have cambic horizons, and are on beaches.  Langston soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have argillic horizons, and are on beach bars.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Paypoint soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, basin wildrye, and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
