PEETZ SERIES

The Peetz series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in gravelly, calcareous, coarse textured Ogallala deposits.  Peetz soils are on knob-like areas and ridges in gravelly upland and terrace breaks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Peetz gravelly sandy loam, native rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; 20 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) thick)

  AC--8 to 23 centimeters (3 to 9 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak coarse granular; hard, friable; 30 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) thick)

  Ck1--23 to 38 centimeters (9 to 15 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable; 40 percent pebbles; lime coated pebbles and rounded fragments of sandstone and brule in horizon; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches) thick)

  Ck2--38 to 71 centimeters (15 to 28 inches); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; hard, friable; 55 percent pebbles; lime coating on pebbles and fragments of sandstone and brule in horizon; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches) thick)

  C--71 to 152 centimeters (28 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; 55 percent pebbles; few cobbles up to 4 inches diameter; brule and sandstone cobbles common in lower position; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Logan County, Colorado; 500 meters (1,640 feet) north of southeast corner sec. 18, T. 11 N., R. 50 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 11 degrees C. (49 to 52 degrees F.)
Calcareous: typically throughout but is leached in the A horizon in some pedons
Reaction: neutral in the upper part to strongly alkaline in the Ck horizon 
Rock fragments: 15 percent A horizon to more than 60 percent in lower part of the control section
Size: mainly gravels but rounded cobble size fragments of sandstone and brule are common

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Horcado series.
Horcado soils have redder hues and are drier in May and June
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: on knob like areas and ridges in the calcareous gravelly uplands and terrace breaks  
Slopes: 0 to 30 percent
Parent material: gravelly, calcareous, coarse textured Ogallala deposits, which have been influenced by eolian and water reworked materials
Average annual precipitation: 41 to 43 centimeters (16 to 17 inches) with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer months
Mean annual temperature: 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.)
Mean summer temperature: 19 degrees C. (67 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dix, Kim, and Wages soils.  
Dix soils are noncalcareous in their control section.  
Kim soils lack a mollic epipedon.  
Wages soils have an argillic horizon which is fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: somewhat excessively drained
Rumoff:  medium or rapid, depending upon gradient
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high or very high

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for native rangeland.  
Native vegetation is mainly blue grama, fringe sage, little blue stem, sideoats grama, and some yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Colorado.  The series is of small extent.
