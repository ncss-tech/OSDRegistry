MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Charles County, Maryland, 2007. 

REMARKS: Piccowaxen soils were previously mapped as Elkton, Keyport, Mattapex, and Othello soils. The Piccowaxen series is mapped on the Maryland Point geologic formation along the Potomac and Wicomico Rivers.  The lithologic discontinuity is attributed to spatially variable carbonates which are derived from buried oyster bars.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (A1, A2 and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 23 to 142 cm  (9 to 56 inches) (Bt1, Btg1, Bt2, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 60 cm of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 152 cm (0 to 60 inches) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory.  Pedon ID: S04MD-017-002.
