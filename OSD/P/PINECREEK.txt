PINECREEK SERIES

The Pinecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains. They formed in material weathered from metasedimentary rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slopes are 25 to 75 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 7.2 degrees C and the average annual precipitation is about 760mm.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinecreek soils are on south and some north-facing mountain slopes at elevations of 670 to 1465 meters. Slopes range from 25 to 75 percent. These soils formed in material weathered form metasedimentary rocks, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Average annual air temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C, and average annual precipitation is 710 to 1015 mm. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahrs, Honeyjones, Hugus, Latour, Lotuspoint, and Tigley soils. The Ahrs soils are on east and west-facing mountain slopes, ashy-skeletal over loamy-skeletal, and have an ochric epipedon. Honeyjones soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and have an ochric epipedon. The Hugus and Tigley soils are on foothills and adjacent dissected terraces, and have argillic horizons. The Latour soils are on mountains at higher elevations and are cryic. The Lotuspoint soils are on south-facing ridges, have a mesic soil temperature regime, and have hard bedrock at 50 to 100cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of mallow ninebark, common snowberry, pine reedgrass, creambush oceanspray, myrtle pachystima, rose, red-stem ceanothus, white spirea, and starry false-Solomons-seal. The moist phase in west Benewah County has a potential natural vegetation of grand fir, Douglas fir, and ponderosa pine with an understory of mallow ninebark, common snowberry, pine reedgrass, creambush oceanspray, myrtle pachystima, rose, thinleaf huckleberry, white spirea, elk sedge, and starry false-Solomons-seal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and Northeastern Washington. MLRA 43A. This soil is moderately extensive.
