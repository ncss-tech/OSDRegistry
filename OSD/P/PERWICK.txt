PERWICK SERIES

The Perwick series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuffaceous sediments, consolidated lake sediments and siltstone.  Perwick soils are on dissected low hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Perwick gravelly loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak very thin and thin platy structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 23 cm thick)

    C1--8 to 41 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, few coarse, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (8 to 33 cm thick)

    C2--41 to 66 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard and hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common fine and medium carbonate filaments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt irregular boundary.  (20 to 50 cm thick)

    Cr--66 cm; white, fractured diatomaceous siltstone; common very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 37 miles south of Carlin; about 50 feet west and 1,250 feet north of the southeast corner of section 3l, T. 27 N., R. 52 E.; USGS Mineral Hill NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 10 minutes 25 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 08 minutes 34 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.1736111 latitude, -116.1427778longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 50 to 100 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or very strongly alkaline.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Average 8 to 16 percent.
Rock fragments:  10 to 35 percent, mainly gravel

A horizon  
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3.

C horizon  
Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam modified by 10 to 35 percent rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Medburn, Pengpong and Turbyfill soils.  

Medburn, Pengpong and Turbyfill soils are deeper than 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Perwick soils are on dissected low hills. These soils formed in residuum derived from consolidated lake sediments, tuffaceous sediments and siltstone.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,555 to 1,955 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pineval, Puett, Ricert and Tulase soils.  Pineval soils are loamy-skeletal and have an argillic horizon.  Puett soils are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Ricert soils have a natric horizon.  Tulase soils lack a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Utah juniper, Wyoming big sagebrush and downy rabbitbrush with a few scattered black sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 25.
