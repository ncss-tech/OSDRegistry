PETTUS SERIES

The Pettus series consists of very deep deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy sediments of Pleistocene and Pliocene ages. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on shoulders on hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

Hidalgo and Pernitas soils: do not have gravel; on a slightly lower position on a similar landform.  
Olmos soils: are shallow over a petrocalcic horizon; on a slightly higher position on a similar landform.  
Parrita and Randado soils: on slightly higher position on a similar landform; petrocalcic horizons and noncalcareous sola.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on slopes of 1 to 3 percent, low on slopes of 3 to 5 percent, and medium on slopes of 5 to 8 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for rangeland.  Grass vegetation includes red grama, lovegrass tridens, witchgrass, hooded windmillgrass, and plains bristlegrass.  Woody vegetation is mainly ceniza, blackbrush, and mesquite.  A few small areas are cultivated in association with deeper soils.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central portion of the Rio Grande Plain of Texas (MLRA 83A, 83C; LRR I).  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  San Patricio and Aransas Counties, Texas; 1974.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the Zapata series. The BCk horizon is not continuously cemented throughout the pedon and is penetrated by roots.  This horizon is probably a degrading petrocalcic horizon.

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon  0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (A horizon)

Calcic horizon  25 to 165 cm (10 to 65 in). (Bk and BCk horizons)

Additional Comments: The official series description was updated during the correlation of Goliad County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Engineering test data from type location on sample S72TX-125-005.
