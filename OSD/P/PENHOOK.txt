RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
A or Ap horizon:

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Virginia, North Carolina
Extent: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Franklin County, Virginia, 2004

REMARKS: Penhook soils were formerly recognized in the Georgeville series. The 4/97 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia dictated the need for the Penhook series as a mesic counterpart. The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 7 inches (O and A horizons)
Argillic horizon-the zone from 7 to 44 inches (Bt horizons)
Series control section-0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S98VA067-006. Additional sample is S97VA067-008.
