PLEIOVILLE SERIES

The Pleioville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly local alluvium derived from volcanic conglomerates and tuff.  They are on plains.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pleioville gravelly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and many very fine roots; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few medium, common fine and many very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt2--6 to 12 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt3--12 to 16 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very gravelly clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 50 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt4--16 to 24 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and on pebbles; 55 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 11 inches thick)

    R--24 inches; cemented volcanic conglomerate composed mainly of andesite, basalt, tuff, and other rocks.

TYPE LOCATION:  Catron County, New Mexico; about 3-1/2 miles southeast of the junction of state road 78 and Forest Service road 951.  East of Corduroy Canyon in the northwest 1/4, southeast 1/4, sec. 36. T. 7 S., R. 10 W;  107 degrees, 49 minutes, 56 seconds west longitude and 33 degrees, 39 minutes, 15 second north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section July through September and December through April. Typic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  42 to 47 degrees F.

Depth to bedrock:  20 to 40 inches

Rock fragments:  35 to 50 percent in the particle-size control section on a weighted average dominantly pebbles

A horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR
Value:  3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture:  sandy loam, loam, or clay loam with gravelly modifiers.

Bt horizon
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fishers (CO), Pinacol (CO) and Ring(NM) series.
Fishers, Pinacol and Ring soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pleioville soils are on plains.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 7,400 to 8,000 feet.  These soils formed in gravelly local alluvium derived from volcanic conglomerates and tuff.   The average annual precipitation is about 14 to 19 inches; the average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. In Colorado slopes range as high as 65 percent and also occur on backslopes.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adman, Bario, Manzano, and Smilo soils.  Adman, Manzano, and Smilo soils have mollic epipedons.   Bario soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pleioville soils are used for grazing.  Present vegetation is blue grama, mountain muhly, pine dropseed, and fringed sagewort.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern New Mexico.  This series is of moderate extent. MLRA 39.
