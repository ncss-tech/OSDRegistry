PADINA SERIES

The Padina series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy residuum derived from sandstone.  These nearly level to moderately steep sloping soils are on broad ridges on inland dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 990.6 mm (39 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Grossarenic Paleustalfs

Native vegetation is a scrub forest of post oak, blackjack oak, bluejack oak, and scattered hickory, with an understory of greenbrier, sassafras, American beautyberry, yaupon, little bluestem, purpletop, sand lovegrass, low paspalums, low panicums, and splitbeard bluestem.
