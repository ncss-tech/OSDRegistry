PERSAYO SERIES

The Persayo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from soft sedimentary bedrock. These soils are on hills, basin floor remnants, fan remnants, dipslopes, scarp slopes and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Persayo silty clay loam in grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silty clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure, weak platy in the upper 1 cm; soft, very friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (2.5 to 18 cm thick)

    C--10 to 36 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silty clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granules; hard, very friable; few fine gypsum crystals; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) gradual smooth boundary. (18 to 36 cm thick)

    Cr--36 cm; calcareous gray and yellow shale and siltstone.
