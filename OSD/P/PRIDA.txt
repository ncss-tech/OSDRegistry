PRIDA SERIES

The Prida series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks and volcanic ash.  The Prida soils are on alluvial flats, channels, lake plains, flood plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

Needle Peak and Parowan soils have do not have silica accumulation and do not have weak continuous brittle matrix.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prida soils are on alluvial flats, channels, lake plains, stream terraces and flood plains.  These soils formed in  alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary, metamorphic and volcanic rocks, and volcanic ash with lacustrine material common in some pedons.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.   The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 230 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sonoma and Wendane soils. Sonoma and Wendane soils have are saturated above 100 cm during part of the year.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Seasonal high water table is 100 to 150 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland, wildlife habitat, irrigated hayland. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, black greasewood, seepweed, basin wildrye, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 24, 27.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Humboldt County, Nevada, (BLM Sonoma Planning Unit), 1974.

REMARKS:  This soil was reclassified from Aquic Durorthidic Torriorthents to an Oxyaquic Torriorthents in 1993 as a result of recent changes in Taxonomy.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 18 cm (The A and part of the Cyz horizons).
Duric horizon - The zone from 58 to 147 cm (Cqy, 2Cqk1 and 2Cqk2 horizons).
Seasonal water table - Within 100 to 150 cm.
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cqy and portions of the Cy and 2Cqk1 horizons).
