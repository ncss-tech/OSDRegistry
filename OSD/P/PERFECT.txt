PERFECT SERIES

The Perfect series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed with reworked glacial drift and colluvium on valley walls and debris cones.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1750 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic Vitrandic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Perfect ashy sandy loam, on a valley wall landform with a SE facing slope of 75 percent at 825 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation.  When described on July 30, 2008 the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this or similar families.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Perfect soils are on valley walls and debris cones at elevations of 750 to 1500 meters.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in reworked glacial drift and colluvium with minor amounts of volcanic ash.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1800 to 3300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C. Frost free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Forbidden (T), Harlequin (T), Tepeh (T) and Triumph (T) series.  Forbidden and Tepeh soils have andic soil properties and are found on more stable portions of the same landforms.  Harlequin soils have a lithic contact at less than 50 centimeters, and are found in association with Perfect soils on steep portions of valley walls.  Triumph soils are found under the herbaceous portions of the same debris cones.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation consists primarily of Pacific silver fir, mountain hemlock, and western red cedar with an understory of vine maple, pachistima, red huckleberry, Alaska huckleberry, queen's cup bead lily, and rattlesnake plantain. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington. MLRA 3. Series is of moderate extent.
