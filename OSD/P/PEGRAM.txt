PEGRAM SERIES

The Pegram series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence. They are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Pegram soils have slopes of 1 to 4 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Pegram silt loam, nonirrigated cropland at 6,100 feet elevation.  (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(8 to 16 inches thick))

    2Bk1--39 to 50 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 90 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    3Bk2--50 to 61 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose; many very fine irregular pores; 90 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bess, Cedarpoint, Chesnimnus, Fewkes, Justesen, McCarey, Pinehollow (T), Redpine (T), Vicking, and Vickton soils.  Bess, Cedarpoint, Fewkes, Justesen, Vicking and Vickton soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments below the argillic horizon.  Chesnimnus soils have hue of 10YR in the argillic horizon.  McCarey and Pinehollow soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Redpine soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pegram soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 5,500 to 7,050 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches, average annual soil temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., the frost free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buist, Georgecanyon and Rexburg soils.  Buist soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and contain less than 18 percent clay.  Georgecanyon soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and are effervescent to the surface.  Rexburg soils have a coarse-silty particle size control section and contain less than 18 percent clay.  Buist soils are on similar landscape positions as Pegram, but are higher on the fan terrace or on slightly higher, convex positions.  Georgecanyon soils are downhill from Pegram soils. Rexburg soils are on higher positions than Pegram soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pegram soils are used for nonirrigated and irrigated cropland and rangeland.  The native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008.  The name is taken from a nearby community where the series was originally proposed.

REMARKS:  The Border series was correlated to the Pegram series at the March, 1990, Bear Lake-Caribou progress review due to a lack of separation criteria.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 14 inches (the Ap and BA horizons).

Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 39 inches (the Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 28 to 50 inches (the Btk and 2Bk1 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 14 inches to the 34 inches (the Bt1, Bt2 and part of the Btk horizons).
