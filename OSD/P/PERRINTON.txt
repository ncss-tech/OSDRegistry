PERRINTON SERIES

The Perrinton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy and/or clayey till on ground moraines, end moraines, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Glossudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Perrinton loam, on a 3 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 48 cm (10 to 29 inches).] 

    BC--76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; about 3 percent fine gravel; white (10YR 8/1) lime streaks; few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Perrinton soils are on ground moraines, end moraines, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The Perrinton soils formed in loamy and/or clayey till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 864 mm (28 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 11.1 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ithaca, Onekama, and Marlette soils. The somewhat poorly drained Ithaca soils on slightly lower landscape positions and the well drained Onekama soils on slightly higher landscape positions are in a drainage sequence with Perrinton soils. Marlette soils are on similar landscape positions and have fine-loamy control sections. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 76 to 183 cm (2.5 to 6.0 feet) between September and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the gently sloping areas are under cultivation to corn, soybeans, small grain, or hay. Some areas are in apple orchards. Most of the steeper areas are in pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is sugar maple, American elm, American beech, white ash, American basswood, red maple, and northern red oak. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 97, 98, and 99 in the southern half and northwestern area of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gratiot County, Michigan, 1975. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
1. Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (7 inches) (Ap horizon). 
2. Argillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches) (B part of B/E, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 
3. Glossic horizon: from a depth of 18 to 38 cm (7 to 15 inches) (E/B and B/E horizons). 

These soils were formerly mapped as dual drainage class (moderately well and well drained) until the Onekama series was established as the well drained component of the catena in 2005.
