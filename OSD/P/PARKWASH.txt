PARKWASH SERIES 

The Parkwash series consists of very shallow to shallow, somewhat excessively drained, very rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum and reworked eolian sand deposits derived from Navajo Formation sandstone. Parkwash soils are a sand mantle located in blowout areas, sand sheets and dunes on structural benches, and climbing dunes. Slope ranges 2 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mesic, coated Lithic Quartzipsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Parkwash loamy fine sand--rangeland, (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated). The surface is covered by 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones.

       C1--0 to 2 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loamy fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4); single grained ; loose, nonsticky, and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; no effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

       C2--2 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6); massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; no effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

       C3--10 to 19 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4); massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; no effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.

       R--19 + inches; Navajo Formation sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Kane County, Utah; southwest quarter of the northwest quarter of sec. 16, T. 42 S., R. 4 1/2 W; Deer Range Point Quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 18 minutes 53.87 seconds North and longitude 112 degrees 06 minutes 04.51 seconds West, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - The soils are dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days during normal years, but are not dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days when the soil temperature at 50 cm is greater than 43 degrees F.   In normal years, the soils are moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the four months following the winter solstice and are dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days during the 4 months following the summer solstice. Aridic ustic moisture.

Mean annual temperature: 47 to 54 degrees F.

Depth to bedrock: 4 to 20 inches

Rock fragments: gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent

Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Particle-size control section: 

Clay content: 1 to 5 percent

C1 Horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist

C2 and C3 Horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Totz (KY) series. Totz soils are in an udic soil moisture regime in the Allegheny-Cumberland Plateau of eastern Kentucky.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parkwash soils are in blowout areas, sandsheets, dunes on structural benches, and climbing dunes at elevations of 4,530 to 8,200 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and reworked eolian sand deposits derived from Navajo sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Pinepoint series.  Pinepoint soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is Utah juniper, two-needle pinyon, green mormontea, manzanita, mountain big sagebrush, bitterbrush, Indian ricegrass, blue grama, needleandthread, and sandhill muhly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah and northern Arizona.  The series is of limited extent. MLRA 35. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Soil Survey, Kane County, Utah 2004. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Lithic contact:  boundary at 15 inches (R horizon)

Siliceous mineralogy - this soil contains more than 90 percent by weight silica minerals, the dominant mineral is quartz with very minor amounts of chalcedony.
