PREY SERIES

The Prey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks. The Prey soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Prey soils are on alluvial fans and terraces at elevations of 1,400 to 1,555 meters. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks with minor amounts from other igneous rocks and gneiss. The climate is cool, semi-arid with a mean annual precipitation of 200 to 400 mm. The mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 95 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glenbrook, Mottsville and Toll soils. Glenbrook soils have sandy particle-size control sections, lack argillic horizons, and have bedrock within depth of 50 cm. Mottsville and Toll soils have sandy particle-size control sections and lack argillic horizons and duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  The vegetation is principally big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, rabbitbrush, squirreltail, needlegrass and Mormon tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Nevada and eastern California east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The series is of small extent. MLRA 26.
