PRIESTLAKE SERIES

The Priestlake series consists of very deep, well-drained soils.  These soils formed in glacial till with a thin mantle of volcanic ash on mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 38 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Dystrocryepts

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Elting, Mirror lake and Tolby series. These soils do not have 2Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Priestlake soils are on sloping to very steep mountainous uplands at elevations of about 2,400 to 5,000 feet and have primarily a northerly aspect at lower elevations.  These soils formed in glacial till with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The climate is subhumid with moderately warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 45 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from about 40 degrees to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ardtoo, Jeru, Hun, Klutch, and Treble soils.  The Ardtoo soils have a frigid temperature regime, southerly aspects, and formed in granite.  Hun soils have volcanic ash in the surface horizons.  Jeru soils are loamy-skeletal and have extremely stony surfaces.  Klutch soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Treble soils have a frigid temperature regime and southerly aspects.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium to very rapid run off; moderately rapid permeability in the solum and rapid or very rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation and watershed.  A few areas are used for livestock grazing.  Principal vegetation is western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine, and western larch with an understory of big blueberry, longtube twinflower, Saskatoon serviceberry, and myrtle pachystima.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, mainly in the Priest Lake Area of Bonner County, Idaho.  The series is moderately extensive.
