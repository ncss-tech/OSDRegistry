     C3--25 to 40 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand; common medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/1) iron depletions; single grained; very friable; few fine roots; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

     Cg--40 to 80 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) loamy sand; common medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) soft masses of iron accumulation; single grained; very friable; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pitt County, North Carolina; about 4 miles north of Grimesland on SR 1566, 350 feet north of intersection SR 1564; 80 feet northeast of barn, 10 feet east of path.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of sandy horizons: 80 inches or more. The 10 to 40 inch control section contains 10 to 25 percent fines
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 80 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 18 to 36 inches, December to April
Soil Reaction: extremely acid to strongly acid except where the surface has been limed 

A or Ap horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 to 4
Texture--loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand 

C horizon (upper part):
Colorhue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 through 8
Texture--sand, loamy sand, fine sand, coarse sand, or loamy fine sand

C horizon (lower part):
Color10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4
Texture--sand, loamy sand, fine sand, coarse sand, or loamy fine sand
Redoximorphic features--iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less may occur in some pedons within a depth of 20 inches. Iron masses in shades of yellow, brown, or red are found in some pedons. 


The upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 through 8.  The lower part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Iron depletions in shades of gray are at depths of less than 40 inches, and may occur within a depth of 20 inches. The lower C horizon in some pedons is mottled with redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red.   Clean sand grains are in the lower part of the C horizon in most pedons.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, coarse sand, or loamy fine sand.

The Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Soft masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown range from none to many.  Texture is the same as for the C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:
Chipley soils--somewhat poorly drained soils (seasonal high water table 18 to 36 inches)with 5 to 10 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 20 inch control section
Kawah soils--somewhat poorly drained soils (seasonal high water table 18 to 36 inches) with 5 to 10 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 20 inch control section
Lotus soils-moderately well to somewhat poorly drained soils (seasonal high water table 18 to 36 inches) with buried A horizons within a depth of 40 inches

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Stream an marine terraces

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Pitt County, North Carolina; 1969.

REMARKS:  This series was previously included in the Klej series, but Klej is in a mesic family.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon)

Aquic conditions - redoximorphic features beginning in the zone between 25 and 40 inches (C3 horizon), and also present in the Cg horizon at 40 to 80 inches.
