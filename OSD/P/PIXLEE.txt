PIXLEE SERIES

The Pixlee series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, moderately rapid to moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from weakly cemented sandstone of the Elk City Formation of Permian age. These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils occur on hill slopes of plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic, shallow Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Pixlee very fine sandy loam, on a southwest-facing, convex, 3 percent slope in pastureland at an elevation of about 600.5 m (1,970 ft).
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

Thickness is 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 in).

Thickness is 15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 in).

  Cr--28 to 40 cm (11 to 16 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weakly cemented sandstone bedrock; strongly effervescent by HCl, 1 normal; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES: 
These are the Keese and Spikebox series in the same family. Similar soils are the Brackett, Cordell, Darnell, Ironmound, Lucien, Quinlan, and Whitewright series. 
Brackett and Whitewright soils: have carbonatic mineralogy and formed in residuum derived from chalk and limestone.
Keese soils: formed in residuum weathered from granite, granite grus, or gneiss of pre-Cambrian age. 
Quinlan soils: have a superactive clay activity class and are formedin residuum weathered from sandstone associated with the Whitehorse and Cloud Chief formations of Permian age.
Spikebox soils: are formed in residuum weathered mainly from the San Angelo formation of Permian age or equivalent units.
Cordell soils: have a lithic contact within 51 cm (20 in) of the soil surface. 
Darnell, Ironmound, and Lucien soils: are moist in the control section for longer periods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:

Land Resource Region: H - Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region
MLRA 78C - Central Rolling Red Plains, Eastern Part
Extent: moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: During the project "MLRA 78C - Dill Series Update on Elk City Sandstone" in Beckham, Custer, Roger Mills, and Washita Counties, Oklahoma; 2011. The name of the series comes from the Thompson Pixlee Cemetery in far south-western Custer County, Oklahoma. 

REMARKS: Pixlee soils were previously mapped as Quinlan soils. It was established to replace Quinlan on the Elk City Sandstone which has a superactive mineralogy class and texture difference.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
  Particle-size control section: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11_in) (Ap & Bw horizons)
  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 11 cm (0 to 4 in) (Ap horizon)
  Cambic horizon: 11 to 28 cm (4 to 11 in) (Bw horizon)
  Paralithic contact: 28 cm (11 in) the top of the Cr horizon.
