SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:
Lake County, Oregon; Southern Part; 1991.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--3 to 39 cm
*Andic soil properties--3 to 99 cm
*Particle-size control section--3 to 103 cm
*Paralithic contact--tuffaceous bedrock at 130 cm

Classification into Andisols is based on laboratory data (glass count and 15 bar water) for the Twelvemile series.  Phosphorous retention is assumed to be greater than 25 percent and acid oxalate-extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate-extractable iron is assumed to be greater than 0.4 percent.

8/31/2023-This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note-Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). Most of the changes were in formatting. Also added ashy modifiers and volcanic ash parent materials, added ashy loamy sand textures to the RIC, expanded ranges of elevation, precipitation, and temperature, updated competing series section, and expanded depth class to include very deep soils (see trip report from May 2015 field review from OR683 Soil Survey Area Project)
