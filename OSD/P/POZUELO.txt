COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material--Fine estuarine deposits
Landscape--Coastal lagoons in semiarid coastal plain, Puerto Rico
Landform--Mainland coves
Mean Annual Air Temperature--22 to 31 degrees C (72 to 88 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation--508 to 1,145 millimeters (20 to 45 inches)
Mean Annual Water Temperature--26 to 32 degrees C (79 to 90 degrees F)
Water salinity range--28 to 43 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Majaguas, Ostiones, and Placeres soils.
Majaguas soils--are in the lower lagoon bottom further from the mangrove margin and has a fine-loamy control section.
Ostiones soils--occur on slightly higher submerged mainland beaches and have coarser textured horizons
Placeres soils--have a skeletal control section and occur in estuarine tidal creeks and streams close to the mangrove margin where more clams and mussels provide shells for the substrate.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous (permanently submersed) 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately low
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic 
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Used for wildlife habitat, recreational boating, fishing, swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish habitat.  These soils provide improved water quality and flood / storm surge water storage.
Dominant Vegetation--Turtle grass (Thalasia testudinum) and paddle grass (Halofila decipiens).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Coastal lagoons along the southern coastal plain of Puerto Rico.
Land Resource Region--Z - Caribbean Region
MLRA--273 - Semiarid Coastal Plains
Extent--Small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Office

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humacao Area, Puerto Rico Eastern Part (PR689); Guayama Municipality, Puerto Rico; 2024. The name is from the Pozuelo peninsula in Guayama which borders a great part of the Jobos Bay lagoon, where it was originally recognized. The word Pozuelo can be translated as a small water hole used to collect water.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously published as water in Puerto Rico Soil Survey publications.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon--
Peraquic soil moisture regime--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 0 to 4 meters of salt water)
Ocrhic epipedon--the zone 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches).
Oxidized pH values--the shell fragments and Halimeda materials that occur throughout this soil buffer the oxidized pH preventing potential sulfidic materials from developing
High n-value--slightly to very fluid throughout
