POTTS SERIES

The Potts series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived mainly from redbed shale and sandstone. Potts soils are on alluvial fans, benches, cuestas, pediments and strike valleys. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Potts loam-grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to very fine granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 cm thick)

    AB--10 to 18 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few thin clay films on some faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt--18 to 46 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; many thin clay films on horizontal and vertical faces of peds in root channels and in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 36 cm thick)

    Btk--46 to 61 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; few thin clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent, lime as common soft masses, thin seams, and streaks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 30 cm thick)

    Bk--61 to 152 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent, lime as soft masses, thin seams, and streaks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2)
