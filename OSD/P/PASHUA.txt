PASHUA SERIES

The Pashua series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that are 20 to 40 inches deep to welded tuff bedrock.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from semi-consolidated welded tuff.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, active, frigid Typic Haplustalfs
