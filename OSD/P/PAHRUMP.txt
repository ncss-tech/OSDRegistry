PAHRUMP SERIES

The Pahrump series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits from lake bed and offshore bar sediments derived from limestone. Pahrump soils are on lake terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C. (64 degrees F.). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, thermic Petronodic Haplocalcids

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Alamoroad (NV), Destazo(CA) and Driftfence (T NM)series. Alamoroad soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. DeStazo soils have mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 18 degrees C. (59 to 64 degrees F.) and is always moist from 20 to 38 centimeters (8 to 15 inches) during late November until March. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pahrump soils are on lake terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits from lake bed and offshore bar sediments derived from limestone. Elevations are 730 to 960 meters (2,400 to 3,150 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, occasionally moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is between 75 to 178 millimeters (3 and 7 inches); mean annual air temperature is between 17 to 18 degrees C. (62 and 65 degrees F.), and frost-free season is about 180 to 240 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo, Commski, Lastchance, Vegastorm, Wodavar and Yermo series. All soils have less than 18 percent clay in their control section. Arizo, Commski, Lastchance and Yermo soils do not have hard calcium carbonate concretions and nodules as rock fragments. Vegastorm soils have recent alluvium over lake sediments. Wodavar soils are shallow to a hardpan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation includes creosotebush, white bursage, Fremont dalea and ephedra. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. The soils are not extensive.
