PIROUETTE SERIES

The Pirouette series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Pirouette soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Natridurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pirouette very cobbly very fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered with a desert pavement of 35 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.

    A--0 to 8 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine and few medium vesicular pores; 2 percent stones, 40 percent cobbles and gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Btn1--8 to 18 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; many fine interstitial and tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 40 percent cobbles and gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    Btn2--18 to 25 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very cobbly clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; many fine interstitial and tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and common faint clay films lining pores and as bridges; 40 percent cobbles and gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    Bqk--25 to 48 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; few fine and medium silica and carbonate concretions; 60 percent rock fragments coated with silica and secondary carbonates; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    Bqkm--48 to 50 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and very pale brown (10YR 8/2) cemented material, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; extremely hard, extremely firm; indurated by silica and secondary carbonates; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0.1 to 13 cm thick)

    R--50 cm; olivine basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pirouette soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1280 to 1829 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bluewing, Celeton, and Theon soils.  Bluewing soils are sandy, very deep, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Celeton soils are shallow to soft bedrock and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Theon soils do not have natric horizons or duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pirouette soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is shadscale, Bailey's greasewood, winterfat, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 27.
