Extent: Small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pasquotank County, North Carolina; 1951.

REMARKS: The April 1993 revision of this series places the Pasquotank series in coarse-silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic Typic Endoaquepts. Classification changed to coarse-silty, mixed, semiactive, Typic Endoaquults in 2000.

Diagnostic horizons and soil properties recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 39 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)

MLRA(S): 153A, 149A, 153B
