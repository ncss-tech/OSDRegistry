PUNALUU SERIES

The Punaluu series consists of very shallow, well drained organic soils.  These soils formed in organic material mixed with minor amounts of basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 890 millimeters (35 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C. (73 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, isohyperthermic, micro Lithic Ustifolists

TYPICAL PEDON: Punaluu highly decomposed plant material, on a west facing, concave, 4 percent slope under shrubs and grasses at an elevation of 78 meters (255 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  All textures are "apparent field textures".  pH measured with organic dyes.  When described on October 8, 1999, the soil was slightly moist.)

  Oa--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); black (10YR 2/1) highly decomposed plant material, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dry; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; very friable nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine irregular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 25 centimeters {2 to 10 inches} thick)

  2R--15 centimeters (6 inches); hard, massive pahoehoe lava.

TYPE LOCATION: Island of Hawaii, Hawaii County, Hawaii; from Honaunau Post Office, drive downslope on Highway 160 to the scenic overlook at an elevation of 82 meters (270 feet); pedon is located 72 meters (235 feet) southwest from the southern end of overlook.  Honaunau Quadrangle; lat. 19 degrees 25 minutes 29.4 seconds N. and long. 155 degrees 54 minute 10.3 seconds W. (GPS/PLGR; Old Hawaiian Datum) 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to bedrock: 5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches).
Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 25 degrees C. (72 to 77 degrees F.)
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent by volume of the pedon and range in size from gravel to cobble size lava rocks.
Organic carbon (by weight): 25 to 30 percent of the less than 2.0 mm soil material.

Oa horizon
Hue: 5YR to 10YR.
Chroma: 1 or 2 moist or dry.
Structure:  Weak to strong granular. 
Soil reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline (pH 6.6 to 7.8).  

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  Similar soils include Honokohau, Kali, and Kekake series.  Honokohau soils have aridic moisture regime.  Kali soils have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 19 to 22 degrees C. (67 to 72 degrees F.) Kekake soils have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 13 to 15 degrees C. (55 to 59 degrees F.)  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Punaluu soils are on low elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from sea level to 305 meters (0 to 1000 feet).  These soils are in depressions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 2030 millimeters (40 to 80 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C. (70 to 75 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Kaimu, Kainaliu, and Waiaha series.  Kaimu soils are organic soils over `a`a lava.  Kainaliu soils are clayey-skeletal.  Waiaha soils are medial-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Runoff is negligible in depressions on gentle slopes and high to very high on steeper slopes.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic soil and very slow in the underlying bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and grazing.  The natural vegetation is koa haole (Leucaena leucocephala) and guineagrass (Urochloa maxima).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North and South Kona districts, Island of Hawaii; MLRA is 161B.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Island of Hawaii, Hawaii County, Hawaii 1971.

REMARKS: Soil moisture - usually moist, but dry in some or all parts for short intermittent periods totaling 90 or more days in most years (Ustic moisture regime).
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Sapric soil materials - from the surface to a depth of 15 centimeters (6 inches) (Oa horizon).
Lithic contact - at a depth of 15 centimeters (6 inches) (2R horizon).

Edit log: 11/3/99 Classification revised due to changes in Soil Taxonomy.  Old Classification: Euic, isohyperthermic Lithic Tropofolists.  Type location moved to a representative site in the Kona area where summer rains are dominant.  Competing series have been updated.  MRK
4/09 Texture updated plus minor edits. MRK
