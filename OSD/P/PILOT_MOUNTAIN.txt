MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina, 2003. 

REMARKS: The high content of rock fragments throughout the soil profile and increased clay in the lower Bt horizon restricts vertical water movement within these soils and increases lateral water movement. This results in the formation of masses of oxidized iron within the B and C horizons of most pedons. Although, this process results in the development of redoximorphic features, water is not present in the soil profile for a significant enough period to identify aquic conditions or a seasonal high water table. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 12 inches (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 12 to 30 inches (Bt horizon) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: Series classification based on sample pedon S92NC-171-005 from the type location and data from several other pedons of the Pilot Mountain soils in Surry County, NC and Patrick County, VA.
