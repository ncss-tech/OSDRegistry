POBLANO SERIES

The Poblano series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from monzonite.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brewster, Rotagilla, and Sotol soils.
Brewster and Rotagilla soils are shallow and very shallow to bedrock and are on mountain tops and flanks.
Sotol soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are on mountain flanks and bases.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is very high on slopes of 5 to 35 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is of the Pinyon-Juniper-Oak savannah type consisting of sideoats grama, blue grama, metcalf muhly, bull muhly, wolftail, alligator juniper, pinyon pine, oak spp., and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dona Ana County, New Mexico; 2001.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 2 to 22 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)

Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 27 inches. (A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).

Argillic horizon: The zone from 2 to 34 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
