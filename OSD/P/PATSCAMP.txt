PATSCAMP SERIES

The Patscamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid rocks. Patscamp soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Patscamp soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from granitoid rocks. Elevations range from 200 to 800 meters (655 to 2,625 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Joetree and the Pintobasin  soils. Joetree soils are on similar landscape positions and have more than 100 centimeters (40 inches) of loamy sand or sand above an argillic horizon and do not have a diagnostic calcic horizon. Pintobasin soils are on fan aprons, are sandy throughout the profile and do not have diagnostic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the argillic horizon, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity within the argillic horizon and high saturated hydraulic conductivity below the argillic horizon.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Patscamp soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush and burrobush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
