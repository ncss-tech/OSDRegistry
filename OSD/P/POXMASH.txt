POXMASH SERIES


The Poxmash soils consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium over residuum derived from permian shale. Poxmash soils are on strath terraces in River Valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches (74 centimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F (14 degrees C).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Attica (KS), and Hayes (KS) series. The Hayes and Attica series are both very deep and occur on dunes on Paleo-terraces. The Hayes series has a buried soil at greater than 30 inches (76 centimeters). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Poxmash soils

Parent material: Alluvium over residuum derived from shale

Mean annual air temperature: 56 to 58 degrees F (13 to 14 degrees C).
Mean annual precipitation: 27 to 29 inches (69 to 74 centimeters)
Wettest months: Mar. to Oct.
Driest months: Nov to Feb.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Piedmont, Jamash, Saxman, and Shellabarger series. The very deep Saxman soils occur on high flood plains and have seasonal high water table. Shellabarger soils occur at higher elevations on paleo-terraces and are very deep also. Jamash and Piedmont soils are pediments that are fine textured. Jamash soils are shallow.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage:  Well drained,
Runoff:  low to moderately high
Permeability:  moderately rapid in the upper part and very slow in the lower part of the horizon .

USE AND VEGETATION: Cropland and native rangeland are the primary land uses. Small grains and sorghum are the primary crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. This series is of minor extent.

POXMASH SERIES
LRR=H
DATE: 04/03/97

Series is set up in the transitional zone between MLRAs 79 and 80A. The central concept is the Arkansas River Valley Alluvium that overlies the Permian bedrock.
This is of very small extent.

6/3/97 PRF: made corrections based on comments from other states. Corrected the landform to a pediment instead of a terrace

12/23/99 PRF: established series by Reno County final correlation.
