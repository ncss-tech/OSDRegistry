PRESNAL SERIES

The Presnal series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material from anorthosite with a mantle of mixed volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes and ridgetops.  Permeability is moderate and slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 43 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Tamarack(T) series.  Tamarack soils have horizons consisting of lamaellae.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Presnal soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops at elevations of 1,600 to 3,000 feet.  They have slopes of 15 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in material from anorthosite with a mantle of mixed volcanic ash.  The average annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 45 inches.  The frost free season is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Floodwood, Keeler and Odonnell series.  Floodwood soils are on mountain slopes and hills and have a thin mantle of unmixed volcanic ash.  Keeler soils are on mountain slopes and hills and have an argillic horizon.  Odonnell soils are on hills and have a glossic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid to very rapid runoff, moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, western hemlock, grand fir, western white pine and douglas fir with an understory of wild ginger, queencup beadlilly, goldthread, northern twinflower, darkwoods violet and oneleaf foamflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-Central Idaho; Presnal soils are not extensive.
