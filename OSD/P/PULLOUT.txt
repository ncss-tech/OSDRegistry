PULLOUT SERIES

The Pullout series consists of very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Pullout soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Halaquepts

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mishak series. Mishak soils have a calcic horizon within 30 to 100 cm, and lack stratified layers with sandy textures below 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pullout soils are on stream terraces. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,000 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eastwalker and Goodbye series.  Eastwalker and Goodbye soils have a mollic epipedon, and have substrata that have more than 35 percent rock fragments below 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly and somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 25 and 100 cm (shallow or moderately deep free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and June. Ponding may occur for brief periods.

USE AND VEGETATION: Pullout soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly inland saltgrass, alkali bluegrass and black greasewood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
