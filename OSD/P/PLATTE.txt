PLATTE SERIES

The Platte series consists of soils that are shallow over coarse sand to gravelly coarse sand. They are somewhat poorly drained soils. They formed in sandy and loamy alluvium deposited over coarse sand or gravelly sand on river valley flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 64 centimeters (25 inches) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, Mixed, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in rangeland. 
A small percentage of areas are cultivated with crops of corn, grain sorghum and soybeans. 
Native vegetation is mainly big bluestem, switchgrass, prairie cordgrass, and little bluestem.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hall County, Nebraska, 1959.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon-0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches)
Aquic conditions: 46 to 203 centimeters (18 to 80 inches) (2Cg horizon) 

Some areas of these soils may classify as Aquic Ustifluvents. These soils need additional water table studies to determine their proper placement in the classification system. Some poorly drained Platte soils may be included in the McCuligan series.

Some pedons have finely disseminated carbonate in the A horizon as evidenced by strong effervescence. This could be related to microrelief in the landform and/or the fluctuations of the water table and capillary rise. This would make the carbonates secondary and should be investigated in the future.
