POSEYVILLE SERIES

The Poseyville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy and loamy material less than 61 cm (24 inches) thick overlying loamy till or lacustrine deposits on till plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Poseyville loamy sand, on an east facing, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 25 cm (7 to 10 inches) thick]

 E--23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand; single grain; loose; many fine roots; many coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 20 cm (8 inches) thick]

 Bt1--41 to 53 cm (16 to 21 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam; weak medium angular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; clay bridging between sand grains; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--53 to 58 cm (21 to 23 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; moderate thick platy structure parting to moderate coarse angular blocky; friable; few fine roots; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and common medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron; clay bridging between sand grains; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 8 to 18 cm (3 to 7 inches).]

 2Cg--58 to 152 cm (23 to 60 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) loam; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; about 6 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Midland County, Michigan; about 2 miles south of Coleman; 2,200 feet east and 200 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 32, T. 16 N., R. 2 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 33 to 61 cm (13 to 24 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 33 to 61 cm (13 to 24 inches)
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the solum
Rock fragment content 0 to 10 percent gravel throughout 

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 to 4
Chroma: 2 to 4

A horizon, where present:
Thickness: 8 to 13 cm (3 to 5 inches)
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2

E horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or fine sandy loam

2C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 1 to 6
Texture: loam or clay loam; some pedons have a stratified layer of very fine sand and silt above the 2C horizon that is 2.5 to 20 cm (1 to 8 inches) thick
Reaction: moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brady, Budd, Dixboro, Whiskerville, and Winamac series. Brady, Budd, Whiskerville, and Winamac soils are deeper than 61 cm (24 inches) to carbonates and to the base of the argillic horizon. Dixboro soils are deeper than 61 cm (24 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Poseyville soils are on lake plains and till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed in sandy and loamy material less than 61 cm (24 inches) thick overlying loamy till or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 8.9 degrees C (47 to 48 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Capac, Londo, and Selfridge soils in similar areas and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Parkhill soils in depressions and drainageways. Capac, Londo, and Parkhill soils do not have the sandy A and E horizons. Selfridge soils have a thicker layer of sandy material overlying the loamy till.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the A and E horizons, and moderately high in the Bt and 2C horizons. Permeability is rapid in the A and E horizons, and moderate or moderately slow in the Bt and 2C horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, field beans, soybeans, sugar beets, hay, and small grain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in central Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
