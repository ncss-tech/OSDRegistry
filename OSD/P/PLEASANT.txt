PLEASANT SERIES

The Pleasant series consists of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils that formed in thick, noncalcareous, silty to clayey materials derived as local alluvium from eolian deposits, silty sedimentary rocks or adjacent soils.  Pleasant soils are on drains, depressions on uplands and fans, and outwash pediments.  Slopes are about 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 41 centimeters (16 inches) and means annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Torrertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pleasant loam is in a grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 centimeters (3 to 8 inches) thick)

  BA--13 to 23 centimeters (5 to 9 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; moderate cracks between peds when dry; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and few faint clay films on the inside of some root channels and pores; neutral (pH 7.2), gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) thick)

  Bt1--23 to 102 centimeters (9 to 40 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; wide cracks between peds when dry; very hard, very firm, sticky, plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and clay films filling on the inside of root channels and pores; clay films as rims around the entrance to soil pores; few glossy slickensides; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (30 to 102 centimeters (12 to 40 inches) thick)

  Bt2--102 to 127 centimeters (40 to 50 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; wide cracks between peds when dry; hard, firm, sticky plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and clay films as coatings and fillings on the inside of root channels and pores; few glossy slickensides; some openings between peds are filled with dark colored material from overlying horizons; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 64 centimeters (0 to 25 inches) thick)

  Bt3--127 to 137 centimeters (50 to 54 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few faint clay films on some faces of peds and clay films coating on the inside of some root channels and pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) thick)

  2C--137 to 152 centimeters (54 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam stratified with clay loam and loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; effervescent in at least the upper part but grades to slightly effervescent material with increasing depth; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C. (48 to 54 degrees F.)  
Depth to uniformly calcareous material: 127 to 152 centimeters (50 to 60 inches) or more.  
Mollic epipedon: 51 to 127 centimeters (20 to 50 inches) thick.  
Depth to the argillic horizon base: 76 to 152 centimeters (30 to 60 inches) or more.

A horizon:
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3

Chroma: 1 to 6
Texture: clay, silty clay loam, or silty clay 
Clay content: 35 to 60 percent 
Silt content: 15 to 55 percent 
Sand content: 5 to 50 percent, with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

C or 2C horizon:
Hue: 5Y to 7.5YR
Texture loam, clay loam, silty loam, or silty clay loam
Reaction: normally neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part but tends to become more alkaline with increasing depths

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Denver, Englewood, Kutch and Zella (T) series.
Denver soils have sola less than 127 centimeters (50 inches) thick to the base of the argillic horizon and have mollic epipedons less than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick.  
Englewood soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon and have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  
Kutch soils have bedrock at depths of less than 102 centimeters (40 inches).
Zella soils formed in eolian loess deposits of Holocene age and are on nearly level plains. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: drains or depressions in fans and outwash pediments
Slopes: typically 0 to 6 percent
Parent materials: thick, noncalcareous, silty, moderately fine to fine textured materials derived as local alluvium from eolian deposits, silty sedimentary rocks, or adjacent soils
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 43 centimeters (14 to 17 inches) with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. (46 to 52 degrees F.)
Mean summer temperature: 21 to 23 degrees C. (68 to 73 degrees F.)
