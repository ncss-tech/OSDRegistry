PHILIPSBURG SERIES

The Philipsburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, hills, mountain slopes and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

Bridger soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizons and lack a calcic horizon. Maciver soils have loamy-skeletal argillic horizons. Tiban soils have a loamy skeletal control section, and lack both argillic and calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Philipsburg soils are primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, mountain brome, Parry's danthonia, sticky geranium, sedum (stoneseed), western yarrow, milkvetch, shrubby cinquefoil, and mountain big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Philipsburg soils are of moderate extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.
