PANACKER SERIES

The Panacker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from limestone and welded tuff.  Panacker soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 2 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Panacker soils are on alluvial flats.  These soils formed in eolian deposits over alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from limestone and welded tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,387 to 1,433 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 180 mm, the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ambush, Geer and Saltydog soils. Ambush soils occur on alluvial flats and have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Geer soils occur on alluvial plains and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Saltydog soils are deeper to the calcic horizon and do not have horizons of secondary silica accumulation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Panacker soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes Indian ricegrass, galleta, fourwing saltbush, and winterfat.  This pedon is correlated to ecological site R029XY046NV, Sandy Loam 5-8 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 4,000 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 29.
