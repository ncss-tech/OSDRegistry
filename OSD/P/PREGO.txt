PREGO SERIES

The Prego series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in noncalcareous alluvium.  Prego soils are on relict stream terraces and relict alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Prego sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--5 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; clay bridging between mineral grains; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--10 to 16 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; clay bridging between mineral grains; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 9 to 17 inches.)

    2C--16 to 60 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) sand; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Carter County, Montana; 1,300 feet south and 1,400 feet west of the NE corner of sec. 7, T.1 N., R.57 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 12 and 35 inches.  Dry in some part for six tenths or more of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature, at 20 inches, exceeds 5 degrees C.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 10 inches (includes part of the Bt horizon).

Depth to 2C horizon - 10 to 20 inches.

These soils are noncalcareous throughout.

2C horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  4, 5, or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  3 or 4

Texture:  sand or loamy sand

Clay content:  1 to 8 percent

Rock fragments:  5 to 35 percent

Reaction:  pH 6.1 to 7.3

COMPETING SERIES:

Cruckton (CO) - have more than 35 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle-size control section.

Ironsprings (CO) - are dry 45 or more consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section after July 1.

Sappington (MT) - have secondary carbonates above a depth of 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - relict stream terraces and alluvial fans.

Elevation - 3,000 to 3,800 feet.

Slope - 0 to 15 percent.

Parent material - noncalcareous alluvium that is 12 to 24 inches deep over sand or loamy sand.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 110 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability in the A and B horizons and rapid permeability in the 2C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Prego soils are used mainly for range.  The native vegetation consists of needleandthread, prairie sandreed, bluebunch wheatgrass, blue grama, little bluestem, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Montana.  Prego soils are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fallon County, Montana, 1991; proposed Carter County, Montana, 1990.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1268.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from 0 to 10 inches (A, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 5 to 16 inches which is the particle-size control section (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); and a discontinuity from 16 to 60 inches (2C horizon).  Prego soils have a frigid temperature regime and ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
