PAX SERIES

The Pax series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum from welded tuff or rhyolite.  They are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Pax very cobbly ashy sandy loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inch; partially decomposed needles, twigs and leaves.

    E--0.5 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; 25 percent cobbles and 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt--8 to 15 inches;  brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; many medium tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    BC--15 to 27 inches; pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) ashy coarse sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, few medium and coarse roots; common medium tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Cr--27 to 60 inches; pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) decomposing welded tuff bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Pax soils are mainly used for woodland, understory grazing, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, Rocky Mountain juniper, limber pine, Oregongrape, common snowberry, bitterbrush, quaking aspen, sandberg bluegrass, tufted hairgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, lupine and rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Pax soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Deer Lodge County, Montana, 1999.

REMARKS:   Soil interpretive record: MT1746.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 8 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 8 to 15 inches (Bt horizon); a particle size control section from 8 to 15 inches (Bt horizon); a layer of decomposing welded tuff from 27 to 60 inches (Cr horizon).  Pax soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
