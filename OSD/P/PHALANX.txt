SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ocean County, New Jersey, 1977 

REMARKS:
06/2000-These soils were formally mapped as Sandy Land, Ironstone in older surveys in New Jersey. This revision was done under the guidance and consultation with Thornton J. Hole, former NRCS project leader who proposed the Phalanx series and wrote the original type location description in Ocean County, NJ. It refines the horizonation and identifies specific cemented (ironstone) layers formally specifically described, but included as part of the Bt or BC horizons. Thickness and percent cementation given for each horizon (originally described as Birm layers) was used as the basis for calculating the depths and thickness of the individual cemented layers (Bm horizons). The new horizonation provides a better format for interpretation generation in NASIS. 
Sandstone bedrock does not exist in soils of the coastal plain of New Jersey. This revision excludes the use of sandstone as a term used in conjunction with cemented materials. Locally, sandstone was commonly used to describe coarse-grained materials in the past. Phalanx soils in NJ are typically red due to ferriferous parent materials. The revision defines the diagnostic horizons and features that are found in this soil. The range of individual horizons has had major revision. In some pedons, it may not be appropriate to identify many very thin Bm layers, and more useful to describe the layer as a Bt/Bm or similar horizon designation. The revision refines the parent materials, geographic setting, and other information that is needed for updating or maintaining modern soil surveys. 
Diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 6 inches, (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 28 inches, (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Petroferric contact--contact at a depth of 28 inches and also at 35 and 43 inches (the upper boundaries of the Bm, B'm, and B''m horizons) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Cemented material--the zone from 28 to 32 inches (Bm horizon), 35 to 40 inches (B'm horizon), and 43 to 46 inches (B''m horizon)
Particle-size control section--the zone from 6 to 28 inches
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 28 inches
