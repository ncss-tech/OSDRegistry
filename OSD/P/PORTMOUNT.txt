PORTMOUNT SERIES

The Portmount series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Portmount soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Portmount gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 60 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse roots; common fine and very fine vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt--8 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine interstitial and tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent very fine and fine gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    2Btk--30 to 86 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots on faces of peds; common fine interstitial and tubular pores; few thin clay films; 40 percent lime-coated gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (36 to 60 cm thick)

    2Bk--86 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent very fine and fine lime coated gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Poobaa series. Poobaa soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Portmount soils are on fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,200 meters.  The climate is cool, with hot summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abgese, Allker and Yody soil.  Abgese, Allker and Yody soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28B.
