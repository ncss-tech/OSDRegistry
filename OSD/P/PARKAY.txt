PARKAY SERIES

The Parkay series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum derived from intermediate and basic igneous rocks or from mixed rock sources.  Parkay soils are on mountains, hills, plateaus, structural benches and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches (53 cm) and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F (3.9 degrees C).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform:  mountains, plateaus, structural benches, and fan remnants - typically occur on backslope positions  
Parent material: alluvium, colluvium, or residuum derived from intermediate and basic igneous rocks, or mixed rocks
Slopes: 2 to 70 percent
Elevation: 7,750 to 10,650 feet (2,362 to 3,246 meters), and as low as 5,200 feet (1,585 meters) in Idaho
Climate: subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 26 inches (41 to 66 cm)
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 42 degrees F (.5 to 5.6 degrees C)
Mean summer temperature: 52 to 55 degrees F (11.1 to 12.8 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 30 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Faim and Forsey soils.  Faim soils have more than 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Forsey soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Parkay soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, lupine, Letterman's needlegrass, Idaho fescue, dryland sedge, tall native bluegrass species, and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and southern Utah, southern Idaho, and northern New Mexico.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The central concept for this series is in MLRA 47 in Utah, although most acres have been mapped in MLRAs 12 and 25 in Idaho.  Minor acreage (3,404 ac.) also occurs in MLRA 39 in New Mexico.  

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fairfield-Nephi Area (Parts of Juab, Sanpete, and Utah Counties), Utah, 1981.

REMARKS:  Type location was moved in 9/2009 to Sevier County, Utah to be located in an area with less summer precipitation and more in line with original xeric concept.

Changes in the definition of the series control section and inclusion of the soil moisture regime in the series concept will make a thorough review of the use the Parkay series a necessity in MLRA updates. The Parkay soil mapped in New Mexico needs future recorrelation to another series. The soils mapped as Parkay in MLRA 25 appear to be outside the series range in soil depth and may need future recorrelation as well. Parkay mapped in Wyoming is a family level component; it was dropped from the range of distribution for this series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 inches (76 cm) (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 30 inches (20 to 76 cm) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 28 inches (20 to 71 cm) (Bt1 horizon and part of the Bt2 horizon).
