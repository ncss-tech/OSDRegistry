PULPIT SERIES

The Pulpit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone.  Pulpit soils are on hills and mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Pulpit loam, on a southeast facing slope, in nonirrigated cropland at an elevation of 6,680 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 10 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; few fine pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt2--10 to 20 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; few tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 30 inches thick)

    Btk--20 to 25 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; common medium calcium carbonate threads and soft masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--25 to 30 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium calcium carbonate threads and soft masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 29 inches thick) 

    Bk2--30 to 36 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) fine sandy loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; common medium calcium carbonate threads and soft masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

   2R--36 inches; hard calcareous sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Altega, Amal, Buick, Chita, Elpedro, Keiser, Klinedraw, Moncha, Oshoto, Roubideau, Sharps, Verde, Wetherill, and Wiley soils. Altega, Amal, Buick, Chita, Elpedro, Keiser, Moncha, Oshoto, Wetherill, and Wiley soils are very deep.  Klinedraw and Sharps soils are moderately deep over soft sandstone or shale.  Roubideau soils lack carbonates in the lower part of the solum. Verde soils have a fragipan-like horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian material derived from calcareous sandstone
Landform: hills and mesas
Slopes: 2 to 12 percent
Elevation: 6,200 to 7,800 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 46 to 50 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cahona, Gladel, Wetherill, and Sharps series.  All soils are found on the same landforms.  Gladel soils are shallow over hard bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, low to high runoff, moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for grazing and for dry or irrigated cropland.  Native vegetation is predominantly sagebrush, pinyon, juniper, western wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of moderate extent.
