PARKLAND SERIES

The Parkland series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. Parkland soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Oxyaquic Argixerolls  

TYPICAL PEDON: Parkland loam on a northeast facing slope of 3 percent under pasture. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated) When described on June 10, 2003, the soil was slightly moist below 50 centimeters.

 Bt4--70 to 117 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 3 percent fine distinct irregular masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 2 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. 

 Bt5--117 to 180 centimeters; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films or pressure faces on all faces of peds; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6). (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 150 to 180 centimeters)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Parkland soils are on stream terraces or alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. Elevations are 35 to 140 meters. These soils formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Garberville (CA) and Grannycreek (CA) soils. Garberville soils lack redoximorphic features within 100 centimeters and Grannycreek soils have redoximorphic features between 10 and 25 centimeters. Garberville soils occur on slightly higher positions and edges of terraces. Grannycreek soils occur on slightly lower, concave positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, low or medium runoff, moderately high to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for pasture and irrigated vegetable crops. Vegetation is annual and perennial grasses, pennyroyal, western rush, and other forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt and Del Norte Counties Soil Survey, Southern Part, California, 2010. The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1. Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 117 centimeters (Ap, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons).
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 180 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).
3. Oxyaquic conditions - the zone from 70 to 180 centimeters (Bt4 and Bt5 horizons)
4. Redoximorphic concentrations in the surface due to compaction, are common in these soils and do not indicate presence of a water table.
5. Particle size control section - 10 to 60 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons) averages 29 percent clay and 16 percent fine sand or coarser, by weight, and 4 percent rock fragments.
