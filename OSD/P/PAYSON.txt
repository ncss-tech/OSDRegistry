PAYSON SERIES

The Payson series consists of somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived mainly from quartzite, shale, and limestone.  Payson soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

    C--24 to 60 inches; pale yellow (5Y 7/3) silt loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; weak medium platy structure; very hard, firm, very plastic and very sticky; few pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.1).

TYPE LOCATION:  Davis County, Utah; about 1 mile west of the Cudahy Meat Packing Company; approximately 860 feet east and 550 feet north of the south quarter corner of section 3, T. 1 N., R. 1 W.; USGS Salt Lake City North 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 40 degrees 50 minutes 36 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees 56 minutes 09 seconds west longitude, NAD83; UTM zone 12N 421102E, 4521793N, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soils are usually moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than one-half of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. They are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months; Xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Mean annual soil temperature - 49 to 52 degrees F.

Ochric epipedon thickness - 2 to 6 inches.

Depth to base of natric horizon - 14 to 24 inches.

Depth to calcic horizon - 9 to 13 inches.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 35 to 50 percent.

Other features - Some pedons have thin A horizons.


E horizons - Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 or 2, dry or moist.
Texture: Silt loam or fine sandy loam; other textures are loam or silty clay loam.


Btn horizon - Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay.
Exchangeable sodium: 15 to 35 percent.
Sodicity (SAR): 10 to 30.


Btnk horizon - Texture: Clay or silty clay.
Exchangeable sodium: 20 to 97 percent.
Sodicity (SAR): 10 to 90.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 50 percent.


C horizon - Texture: Silt loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay.
Exchangeable sodium: 20 to 97 percent.
Sodicity (SAR): 13 to 90.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 50 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Stokes series.  Stokes soils have ochric epipedons 6 to 13 inches thick and have calcic horizons at depths of 13 to 24 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Payson soils are on low lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks that are mainly quartzite, shale, and limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 65 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 150 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Airport, Arave, Saltair, Terminal, and Warm Springs soils.  Airport soils are fine-silty and have mollic epipedons.  Arave soils are fine-loamy.  Saltair soils are fine-silty, have salic horizons, and do not have natric horizons.  Terminal soils are loamy and shallow to duripans.  Warm Springs soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons, and do not have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; slow or very slow permeability (low to moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.5 and 4.5 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for long periods between April and June or rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Payson soils are used for rangeland and urban development.  The native vegetation is mainly black greasewood, inland saltgrass, and annual weeds.  The strongly saline affected areas are nearly barren.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 5,600 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Davis County (Davis-Weber Area), Utah, 1967. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 inches (E1 and E2 horizons).

Albic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 inches (E1 and E2 horizons).

Natric horizon - The zone from 4 to 24 inches  (Btn and Btkn horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 24 inches (Btkn horizon).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 48 inches at certain times during normal years (part of the C horizon).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 24 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 142-143, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.
