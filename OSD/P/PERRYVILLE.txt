PERRYVILLE SERIES

The Perryville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Perryville soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Perryville soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent. The soil formed in mixed alluvium from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, granite, limestone and quartzite.  The climate is arid and semiarid continental with mild winters and extremely hot summers.  Elevation ranges from 400 to 2500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 4 to 10 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 67 degrees to 74 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Laveen, Gunsight, Rillito, Cavelt, Gilman, Glenbar, Mohall and Pinal soils.  Cavelt soils have strongly cemented petrocalcic horizons at shallow depths.  Gilman and Glenbar soils do not have calcic horizons and have mixed mineralogy.
 Mohall soils have moderately fine-textured argillic horizons.  Pinal soils have an indurated duripan at shallow depths.  Laveen, Gunsight, and Rillito are not carbonatic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Under irrigation, these soils are used for cotton and alfalfa.  Native vegetation is mainly creosotebush, triangleleaf bursage, fourwing saltbush, cholla cactus, alfileria, sixweeks grama, white bursage and littleleaf paloverde.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  Perryville soils are of small extent.  MLRA is 40.
