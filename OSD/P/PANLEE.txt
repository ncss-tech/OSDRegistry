PANLEE SERIES

The Panlee series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks with components of loess and volcanic ash.  The Panlee soils are on hill and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Petrocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Panlee gravelly very fine sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles.

(5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 25 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial  and common very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw--25 to 74 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.

    Bq--74 to 89 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent weakly cemented durinodes; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 23 cm thick)

    Bqk--89 to 107 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin silica bridges on sand grains that are slightly brittle when wet; carbonates are disseminated; strongly effervescent; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 cm thick)

    2Bkqm--107 to 114 cm; very pale brown(10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very hard; very firm; continuous 1 to 2 mm thick horizontal silica laminae that is extremely hard and extremely firm; carbonates are disseminated; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    3R--114 cm; fractured andesite with silica coating fractures.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.

Chroma: 2 or 3.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bw horizons
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.
Texture:  Very gravelly or very cobbly, very fine sandy loam or silt loam.
Other features:  Some pedons have discontinuous pockets and lenses of weakly cemented durinodes along the lower horizon boundary.

Bqk and Bq (when present)
Value:  5 through 7 dry; 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.

Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Carbonates:  Bqk horizons are slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.
Silica cementation or durinodes:  Have up to 15 percent weakly cemented durinodes or few or common weak silica bridges between sand grains.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Panlee soils are on hill and mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from mixed rocks with a small component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,310 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gowjai, Old Camp and Atlow soils.  Gowjai soils have a mollic epipedon and a frigid temperature regime.  Old Camp and Atlow soils are shallow over bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity rmeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush and basin big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 24.
