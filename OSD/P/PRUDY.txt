PRUDY SERIES



The Prudy series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in

mixed colluvium over calcareous quartzite residuum.  Prudy soils are on

mountainsides and have slopes of 30 to 60 percent.  Permeability is

moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the

average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium

roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 30 percent

pebbles; violent effervescence (25 to 40 percent calcium carbonate);

thick)

slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine

and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; about 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent pebbles; violent effervescence (25 to 40 percent calcium carbonate); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)



    2Bqkm--42 to 50 inches; white (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, very

pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; massive or in places strong medium platy

structure; few fine and medium roots matted on top of duripan; about 10

percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles cemented in place; violent

effervescence (25 to 40 percent calcium carbonate); strongly alkaline

(pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)



    2R--50 inches; fractured calcareous quartzite bedrock with Bqkm

material in fractures.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in this family.  Escarlo soils

are similar.  Escarlo soils have carbonatic minerology.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prudy soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range

from 30 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,000 feet.  The

soils formed from colluvium over residuum derived dominantly from

calcareous quartzite.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 20

inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average

annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is

30 to 60 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackspot, Elksel,

Furshur, Friedman, Peeveywell, and Winridge soils.  Blackspot soils are

10 to 20 deep to a duripan.  Elksel soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments and more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Furshur soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and are 10 to 20 deep to a duripan.  Friedman soils have Pachic epipedons.

Peeveywell soils are moderately deep to a duripan and contain more than

35 percent clay in the control section.  Winridge soils are moderately

deep and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.

Blackspot soils occur on the same landscape.  Elksel, Furshur, Hamtah,

Peeveywell, and Winridge soils occur on mountainsides formed from

tertiary volcanics.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff;

moderate permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is mountain

big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, snowberry, and Idaho fescue.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Prudy soils are inextensive in south central

Idaho.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:


Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to about 14 inches (A1, A2, and BAk horizons)



Calcic horizon - zone from 14 to 42 inches (BAk, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3

horizons)



Particle - size control section - 10 to 40 inches (BAk, Bk1, Bk2, and

below a depth of 1 meter.
