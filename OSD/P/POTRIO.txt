REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches (0 to 10 centimeters). (A horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 36 inches (10 to 91 centimeters). (Bt, Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 42 inches (38 to 107 centimeters). (Btk, Bk horizons)
Lithic contact:  42 inches (107 centimeters).

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
