PELLERNARQUQ SERIES

The Pellernarquq series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over loess. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 690 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, dysic Terric Cryohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Pellernarquq peat, located on a dip of a plain with a slope of 2 percent and elevation of 33 meters; when described on July 28th, 2007 the soil was moist from 0 to 20 cm and saturated from 20 to 183 cm (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi1--0 to 20 cm; peat; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and common coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear smooth boundary

 Oi2--20 to 46 cm; peat; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and few coarse roots; extremely acid (pH 4.4); diffuse smooth boundary

 Oe--46 to 92 cm; mucky peat; many very fine and fine roots, few medium roots,and few coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear smooth boundary

   A--92 to 105 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mucky silt loam; 20 percent sand; 75 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary

 Cg--105 to 183 cm; 60 percent dark gray (5Y 4/1) and 35 percent greenish gray (10Y 5/1) silt loam; 20 percent sand; 75 percent silt; 5 percent clay; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots and few medium roots and few coarse roots; 5 percent coarse dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist, masses of oxidized iron with diffuse boundaries; moderately acid (pH 5.8)
