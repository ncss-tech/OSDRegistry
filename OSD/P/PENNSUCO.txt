COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lignumvitae and Perrine series.
Lignumvitae soils have limestone bedrock at depths less than 100 centimeters, are subjected to flooding by tides, storm surges, and hurricanes, and occur in low broad tidal flats.
Perrine soils have bedrock at depths less than 100 centimeters and occur on similar landform positions.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: calcareous silty marl sediments from fresh water over oolithic limestone bedrock
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): freshwater marshes, swamps, and low broad coastal flats on marine terrace
