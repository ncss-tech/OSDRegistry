PEACHSPRINGS SERIES

The Peachsprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Slope is 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abra (AZ), Bighams (AZ), Bowdish (CO), Copeman (WY), Creel (NM), Darvey (NM), Hernandez (NM), Honlu (UT), Kimera (CO)(T), Numa, and Xenmack (NM) series.  Abra soils do not have buried calcic horizons. Copeman soils have accumulations of gypsum in the lower part and a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F. Darvey and Hernandez soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Bighams, Bowdish, Creel and Xenmack soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Kimera soils are drier in the soil moisture control section during the winter months.  Honlu soils have mean annual soil temperatures between 47 and 51 degrees F.  In addition, Creel, Darvey, and Numa soils are moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peachsprings soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 4300 to 5100 feet.  Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources in Tertiary fluvial beds of the Willow Springs formation.  Mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The frost-free period is 135 to 175 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barx, Curhollow, Dean, Rolie and Manikan soils.  Barx soils have argillic horizons.  Curhollow and Rolie soils have a petrocalcic horizon within 20 inches.  Dean soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Manikan soils do not have calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing and homesite development.  The present vegetation is blue grama, black grama, needleandthread, banana yucca, and scattered Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  Peachsprings soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 35.
