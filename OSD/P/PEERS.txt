PEERS SERIES                   

The Peers series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in Missouri River alluvium. These soils occur on flood plains and flood plain steps and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fatima, Gilliam, Radford, and Tice series. Fatima and Tice soils do not have free carbonates. Gilliam soils do not have cambic horizons and have free carbonates throughout the calcareous class control section. Radford soils contain a dark colored buried soil within a depth of 20 to 40 inches and do not have free carbonates. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peers soils are on nearly level, linear to concave areas. These soils formed in Missouri River alluvium and occur on flood plains and flood plain steps. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1020 millimeters (35 to 40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The poorly drained Booker and SansDessein soils and the somewhat poorly drained Blencoe soils are on slightly lower areas. The well drained Lowmo soils are on slightly higher areas. Blencoe, Booker, and SansDessein soils contain more clay in the particle size control section. Lowmo soils contain less clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for runoff is low to medium. Permeability is moderately slow. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) is 1.4-4 micrometers per second. In undisturbed areas an apparent water table has an upper limit of 51 to 75 centimeters (20 to 29 inches) during November to May in most years. These soils are subject to occasional flooding due to levee breaks.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for growing soybeans and corn. The native vegetation is trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Central Mississippi Valley Wooded Slopes, MLRA 115B, of east central Missouri. The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: St. Charles County, Missouri, 2009. 

REMARKS: These soils were previous mapped Blake soils in Missouri. They differ from Blake soils by having a mollic epipedon and a cambic horizon.  They also lack carbonates throughout the control section for the calcareous class. The name is from a small town in the survey area. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 56 centimeters (22 inches) (Ap1 Ap2, and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 56 to 150 centimeters (22 inches to 50 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data; University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri; Pedon ID M0718313 is data for the OSD typical pedon; Pedon IDs M0613904, M0621903, M0621905, M0713905, M0715103, M0718904, M0721907, and M0721909 are additional data used for the series range in characteristics.
