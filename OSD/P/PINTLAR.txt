PINTLAR SERIES

The Pintlar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, swales and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Palecryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pintlar loam, native grass (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 7 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--7 to 15 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine and medium pores; neutral pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

    E--15 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine, few medium pores; 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

    E/Bt--31 to 36 inches; E part (70 percent) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist tongues; Bt part (30 percent) brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt--36 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; few faint discontinuous dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist, clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0570.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 15 inches (A horizons); an argillic horizon from 36 to 60 inches (Bt horizon); a particle-size control section from 36 to 56 inches (part of Bt horizon).  Pintlar soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
