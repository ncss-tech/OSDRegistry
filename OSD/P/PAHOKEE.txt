PAHOKEE SERIES

The Pahokee series consists of  moderately deep and deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in well decomposed, hydrophytic herbaceous plant remains overlying limestone bedrock on nearly level rises and/or dips in fresh water marshes and swamps.  Slopes ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1550 millimeters (61 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, hyperthermic Lithic Haplosaprists

TYPICAL PEDON: Pahokee muck--cultivated, (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

 Oap--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches); black (N 2/) muck; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium granular; very friable; less than 5 percent fiber, unrubbed; about 10 percent estimated mineral content; sodium pyrophosphate extract is brown (10YR 4/3); slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) thick)

 Oa1--25 to 71 centimeters (10 to 28 inches); black (5YR 2/1) muck; massive; friable; about 65 percent fiber, unrubbed and 10 percent rubbed; about 10 percent estimated mineral content; sodium phosphate extract is pale brown (10YR 6/3); slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Oa2--71 to 105 centimeters (28 to 42 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) muck; massive; friable; about 40 percent fiber, unrubbed and 10 percent fiber, rubbed; about 10 percent estimated mineral content; sodium phosphate extract is pale brown (10YR 6/3); slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): very high to high
Permeability: rapid 
Surface runoff: negligible
Depth to seasonal high water table: Under natural conditions, the soil is covered by water (ponded), or the water table is within 25 centimeters (10 inches) of the surface for 9 to 12 months during most years, except during extended dry periods; in other areas the water table is controlled by anthropogenic activities. 
Flooding frequency and duration: None
Ponding frequency and duration: Frequently for long duration (9 to 12 months)

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Under natural conditions Pahokee soils are used for water quality, water quantity and wildlife habitat. 
In drained areas under agriculture Pahokee soils are used for growing sugarcane, corn, sod, improved pasture, vegetables and other specialty crops. 
Potential natural vegetation consists of sawgrass, sedges, lilies, willow, spikerush, elderberry, and cypress. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA): This soil mainly occurs in Florida Everglades and Associated Areas (MLRA 156A). It also occurs in less extent in Southern Florida Flatwoods (MLRA 155) and Southern Florida Lowlands (MLRA 156B).
Extent: Large extent
