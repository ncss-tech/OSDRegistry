PRIMGHAR SERIES

The Primghar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess on uplands and high stream benches.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 690 millimeters (27 inches).
