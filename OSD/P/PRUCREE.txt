PRUCREE SERIES

The Prucree series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum, slope alluvium and alluvium from sandstone.  They are on ridges, mountainsides, and hillsides.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Prucree soils have slopes of 4 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Prucree sandy loam, rangeland; on a 12 percent south facing slope at 6,440 feet elevation.  When described on September 4, 1991 the soil was dry in the upper two inches, slightly moist to ten inches and dry below. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    BA--2 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--10 to 19 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw2--19 to 28 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Cr--28 to 29 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist, sandstone that can be broken in the hands and that breaks down slightly when soaked in water.  Material can be rubbed to a loamy fine sand texture.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    R--29 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3), dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist, sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Iver, Kabear, Lobert, Ola, Redmount, Shively, Suryon (T), Taterpa, and Wagore series.  Iver, Kabear, Lobert, Redmount, Shively, Suryon, Taterpa and Wagore soils are greater than 40 inches deep.  Ola soils have average annual soil temperature of 42 to 47 degrees F. and do not have Bw horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Prucree soils are on ridges, mountainsides, and hillsides.  Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 6,250 to 7,250 feet.  The soil formed in residuum, slope alluvium and alluvium from sandstone.  Average annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches, average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F., the frost free period is 65 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dipcreek (T), the competing Suryon (T), and the Vipont soils.  Dipcreek soils are shallow to bedrock and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Vipont soils have an argillic horizon.  Dipcreek soils are on similar landscapes as Prucree, but are on slightly higher convex slopes.  Suryon soils are on foot slopes, terraces and in concave areas generally below Prucree soils.  Vipont soils are on similar landscapes to Prucree and are generally south-facing.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Prucree soils are used for rangeland.  The native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent.
