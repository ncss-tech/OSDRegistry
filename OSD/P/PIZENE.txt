PIZENE SERIES

The Pizene series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Pizene soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Azabache, Fajada, Hadden, Highrock, Homko, Leebench, Leeko, Muff, Recapture, Rusty, Swasey, Terlco, Thermosprings, and Uffens series.

Azabache soils have horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments between 38 and 100 cm and do not have albic horizons. Fajada, Hadden, and Muff soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Highrock soils do not have albic horizons.  Homko soils have calcic horizons, horizons with secondary gypsum below the natric horizon, and do not have albic horizons.  Leebench soils have calcic horizons.  Leeko soils have calcic horizons and horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments between 100 and 150 cm.  Recapture soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and do not have albic horizons.  Rusty soils have C horizons within 100 cm that are stratified lacustrine sand to silt loam.  Swasey soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Terlco and Thermosprings soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during summer months and do not have albic horizons.  Uffens soils do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pizene soils are on fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks, some of which is redeposited eolian material.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 1,524 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rednik and Isolde soils.  Rednik soils are loamy-skeletal and have sodium-affected argillic horizons which lack prismatic structure.  Isolde soils are sandy and occur on dunes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pizene soils are used mainly for rangeland, although some areas of these soils were previously irrigated and farmed.  The vegetation in rangeland is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, black greasewood, spiny hopsage, Indian ricegrass, and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada in the Great Basin section of the Basin and Range Physiographic Province.  These soils are not extensive with about 7,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  The series concept and main acreage occurs in MLRA 27.  Other acres of this series are mapped in MLRA 26.
