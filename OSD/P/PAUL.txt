PAUL SERIES

The Paul series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources, but mainly from sandstone and limestone. Paul soils are on alluvial fans and river terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Torrifluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Paul silty clay loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap1--0 to 13 cm; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; moderately calcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

 Ap2--13 to 33 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; moderately calcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

 Bk1--33 to 114 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (36 to 81 cm thick)

 Bk2--114 to 147 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (33 to 51 cm thick)

 2C--147 to 150 cm; very gravelly coarse sand; lime coated gravels and cobbles; 80 percent gravel, l0 percent cobble.

TYPE LOCATION:  Bonneville County, Idaho; 6.4 km northeast of Idaho Falls, approximately 402 meters west and 61 meters north of the southeast corner of section 36, T. 3 N., R. 38 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 6 to 8 degrees C
Mean summer temperature from 17 to 19 degrees C. 
The 25 to 100 cm control section is predominantly silty clay loam or silt loam averaging 23 to 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and less than 15 percent gravel.
Mollic epipedon is 30 to 46 cm thick.
Reaction of the profile is mildly or moderately alkaline.

A horizons
Hue: 7.5YR or 5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3  
Texture: silty clay loam, silt loam or sandy loam

B horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silty clay loam or silt loam

C horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4
Texture: silty clay loam or silt loam, with very gravelly coarse sands in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils listed in the same family.

Similar soils are the Paesl series.  Paesl soils have contrasting layers of sand and gravel at depths of less than 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Paul soils are on alluvial fans and river terraces at elevations of 1370 to 1525 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent but dominantly less than l percent.  This soil formed in alluvium from mixed sources, but mainly from sandstone and limestone. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 310 millimeters.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ammon, Bannock, and Paesl soils.  Ammon soils have less than l5 percent coarser than very fine sand in their textural control sections.  Bannock and Paesl soils are less than 100 cm to contrasting layers of sand and gravel.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all of this soil is irrigated.  Alfalfa, small grains, sugar beets, potatoes, and pasture are the main crops grown.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The series is moderately extensive.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Bonneville County, 1977.

REMARKS:

The type location and classification have been changed, in this description, from that found on the January, 1973 official series description of the Paul series.

The January, l973 classification was fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Aridic Calcixerolls.
