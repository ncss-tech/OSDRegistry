PAUL SERIES



The Paul series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in

alluvium from mixed sources, but mainly from sandstone and limestone.

Paul soils are on alluvial fans and river terraces and have slopes of 0

to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about ll inches and the

mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Torrifluventic Haploxerolls

Haploxerolls.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Paul silty clay loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for dry

soil unless otherwise noted.)



    Apl--0 to 5 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) silty clay loam, dark

reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure;

hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots;

moderately calcareous; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth

boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)



    Ap2--5 to l3 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark

reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure;

hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots;

moderately calcareous; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth

boundary.  (8 to l2 inches thick)



    B2ca--l3 to 45 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) silty clay

loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse and medium

subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few

fine and very fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; strongly

calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (l4

to 32 inches thick)



    Clca--45 to 58 inches; pale brown (l0YR 6/3) silt loam, yellowish

brown (l0YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; few very

fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; strongly calcareous;

moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (l3 to 20 inches

thick)



    IIC2ca--58 to 60 inches; very gravelly coarse sand; lime coated

gravels and cobbles; 80 percent gravel, l0 percent cobble.



TYPE LOCATION:  Bonneville County, Idaho; 4 miles northeast of Idaho

Falls, approximately l320 feet west and 200 feet north of the southeast

corner of section 36, T. 3 N., R. 38 E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from

43 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature from 62 to 67

degrees F.  The l0 to 40 inch control section is predominantly silty

clay loam or silt loam averaging 23 to 35 percent clay, more than l5

percent coarser than very fine sand and less than l5 percent gravel.

The mollic epipedon is l2 to l8 inches thick.  Reaction of the profile

is mildly or moderately alkaline.



The A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3

moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam or sandy

loam.



The B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4

moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.



The C horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2

through 4.  It is dominantly silty clay loam or silt loam, with very

gravelly coarse sands in the lower part.



COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils listed in the same family.

Similar soils are the Paesl series.  Paesl soils have contrasting

layers of sand and gravel at depths of less than 40 inches.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Paul soils are on alluvial fans and river

terraces at elevations of 4,500 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2

percent but dominantly less than l percent.  This soil formed in

alluvium from mixed sources, but mainly from sandstone and limestone.

The frost-free season is 90 to l20 days.  The mean annual precipitation

ranges from l0 to l2 inches.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ammon, Bannock, and

Paesl soils.  Ammon soils have less than l5 percent coarser than very

fine sand in their textural control sections.  Bannock and Paesl soils

are less than 40 inches to contrasting layers of sand and gravel.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow

permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all of this soil is irrigated.  Alfalfa,

small grains, sugar beets, potatoes, and pasture are the main crops

grown.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The series is moderately

extensive.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Bonneville County, l977.



REMARKS:  The type location and classification have been changed, in

this description, from that found on the January, l973 official series

description of the Paul series.  The January, l973 classification was

fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Aridic Calcixerolls.
