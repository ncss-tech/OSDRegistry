PENA SERIES

The Pena series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvial deposits derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on bajadas, terraces and knolls with slopes ranging from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pena gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 20 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles and a few stones; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk1--8 to 18 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; strongly effervescent with thin patchy calcium carbonate coatings on bottom of pebbles, cobbles and stones and few thin lime veins and finely divided calcium carbonates throughout; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk2--18 to 30 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly sandy clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine and medium interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; nearly continuous calcium carbonate coatings on coarse fragments; strongly effervescent of which about 30 percent of the fine earth is calcium carbonate that is finely divided throughout; moderately alkaline; gradual irregular boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk3--30 to 65 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely cobbly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles, 40 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones; thin nearly continuous calcium carbonate coatings on coarse fragments, mostly in the upper 12 inches of this horizon; strongly calcareous with about 20 percent of the fine earth as calcium carbonate that is finely divided throughout, decreasing gradually in amount below 42 inches; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Otero County, New Mexico; 7,260 feet west and 1,850 feet south of Cambell Well;  105 degrees, 52 minutes, 36 seconds west longitude; 33 degrees, 14 minutes, 00 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section December through April and July through September.  The soil is driest during May and June.

Soil Temperature:  47 to 59 degrees F.

Depth to calcic horizon:  10 to 40 inches

Mollic epipedon:  10 to 20 inches thick

Rock fragments:  35 to 85 percent in the particle-size control section and increasing with depth

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR 
Value:  3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist 
Texture:  sandy loam, loam  
Reaction:  slightly to moderately alkaline

Bk horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR 
Value:  4 to 8 dry, 3 to 7 moist 
Chroma:  1 to 4, dry or moist 
Texture:  sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam 
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  more than 15 percent in some part that is more than 6 inches thick.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ayon(NM), Curabith(CO), Hogadero(NM), and Modyon(NM) series.  Ayon soils have dominantly basalt rock fragments and the majority are greater than 10 inches in size.  Curabith soils have mollic epipedons less than 10 inches thick and are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section periodically during May and June. Hogadero soils have a cemented calcic horizon with hardness of less than 3. Modyon soils have bedrock between depth of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pena soils formed in alluvial deposits derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on bajadas, terraces, and knolls.  Recent washes and arroyos have dissected the old sediments.   Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 4,300 to 7,800 feet.   Pena soils occur in a semiarid climate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 17 inches with a maximum during July, August, September and October.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dioxice, Guy, Irock, Oro Grande, Shanta and the competing Hogadero soils.  Dioxice, Guy and Shanta soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Oro Grande soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pena soils are used primarily for livestock grazing and watershed.  Principal vegetation is blue grama, black grama, sideoats grama, hairy grama and pinyon juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern New Mexico and southern Colorado; the series is of moderate extent.
