PINERIDGE SERIES

The Pineridge series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly or poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Pineridge soils are on flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy, isotic, frigid Hydraquentic Humaquepts

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pineridge soils are on flood-plain steps of glacial valley floors, mountains, and plateaus. Slopes range from01 to 10 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 1950 to 3080 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 1350 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 3 to 9 degrees C. The frost free season is 75 to 145 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Funston and Wager soils. The Funston soils are poorly or very poorly drained soils on flood plains and flood-plain steps, have an ochric epipedon, and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. The Wager soils are organic soils on flood plains and are very poorly or poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly or somewhat poorly drained, moderately high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity, rare to occasional flooding for very brief to long (4 hours to 30 days) duration from May to July, rare to occasional ponding for brief duration from May to July. Seasonal high water table at 10 to 25 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is shooting star, sneezeweed, aster, narrow leaved lotus, carex, dwarf bilberry, Lemmon's willow, Sierra willow, corn lily, juncus, grasses, black cottonwood, and scattered lodgepole pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are not extensive.
