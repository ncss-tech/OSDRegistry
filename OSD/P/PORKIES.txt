PORKIES SERIES

The Porkies series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy-skeletal till on bedrock controlled ground moraines and end moraines.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the upper part, very slow in the fragic layer, and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the pedon.  Slopes range from 35 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy-skeletal till 
Landforms:  bedrock controlled ground moraines and end moraines

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arcadian, Flintsteel, Gogebic, Michigamme, Oldman, and Watton soils.  
Arcadian - are on similar landform positions, but are 25 to 51 centimeters deep to bedrock, and in the Lithic Haplorthods Subgroup.  
Flintsteel - are on lower elevations, are in the fine-loamy particle-size class, and in the Oxyaquic Glossudalfs Subgroup.
Gogebic - are on less sloping landform positions, have fragic soil properties with an upper boundary within 100 centimeters of the soil surface, are in the coarse-loamy particle-size class, and in the Oxyaquic Fragiorthods Subgroup.
Michigamme - are on similar landform positions, but are 51 to 102 centimeters deep to bedrock, and in the coarse-loamy particle-size class.
Oldman - are on less sloping landform positions, have fragic soil properties with an upper boundary within 100 centimeters of the soil surface, and are in the Alfic Oxyaquic Fragiorthods Subgroup.
Watton - are on lower elevations, are in the fine-loamy particle-size class, and in the Haplic Glossudalfs Subgroup.

Oldman soils form a drainage sequence (catena) with Porkies. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage  water saturation does not occur above a depth of 203 centimeters year round (well drained).  Additionally, a dry layer occurs from 20 to 40 centimeters deep in July and August.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (A, E, Bhs, Bs, and Bt horizons) - moderate
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Btx horizon) - very slow
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (E/Bt horizon) - moderate or moderately rapid

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested.  Major species are sugar maple, basswood, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, ironwood, northern red oak, red maple and white pine.  Quaking aspen, white birch and balsam fir may be found in areas that have been logged or burned.  Understory vegetation includes spinulose shield fern, long beechfern, oak fern, blue cohosh, white baneberry, downy yellow violet, Canada white violet, sweet cicely, large-leaved aster, rosey twisted stalk, hairy solomon's seal, false solomon's seal and wild lily-of-the-valley.
