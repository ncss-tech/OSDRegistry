PRAMISS SERIES

The Pramiss series consists of moderately deep to shale, well drained soils that formed in reworked eolian material, eolian deposits and clayey slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Pramiss soils are on hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pramiss very cobbly loam, on a south facing, 14 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 7,280 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones.

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong thick platy vesicular crust overlying weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 7 inches) 

    AB--3 to 8 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches) 

    Bt--8 to 16 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to strong coarse angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many distinct clay films on the faces of peds; 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 15 inches) 

    Btk1--16 to 22 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common distinct clay films on the faces of peds; 2 percent gravel; few fine soft irregular masses of calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy.  (3 to 9 inches) 

    Btk2--22 to 31 inches; pink (5YR 7/4) clay, pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few faint clay films on the faces of peds; 2 percent gravel; many fine irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches) 

   2Cr--31 inches; calcareous soft sandstone and shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Absarokee, Acree, Brolliar, Delson, Herm, Morapos, Nortez, Peninsula, Reget, Ricot, Tamaneen, Tomasaki, Tukuhnik, and Work series.

The Absarokee, Brolliar, and Nortez soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

The Acree, Delson, Herm, Morapos, Peninsula, Ricot, Tamaneen, Tomasaki, and Work soils do not have bedrock above a depth of 60 inches.

Reget soils have hues of 10YR or yellower in the argillic horizon.

Tukuhnik soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material:  reworked eolian material, eolian deposits and clayey slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale
Landform:  hills and ridges
Slopes:  2 to 25 percent
Elevation: 7,100 to 8,500 feet
Mean annual temperature:  43 to 47 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 20 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer. 
Frost-free period:  75 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Nortez soils, and the Granath, Ormiston, and Hesperus soils on similar positions.  Granath, Ormiston, and Hesperus soils do not have paralithic contacts above a depth of 40 inches .

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, high or very high runoff, slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are used for grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Native vegetation is sagebrush, Gambel's oak, squawapple, junegrass, and western wheatgrass.  Nonstony surface areas are used to grow Pinto beans, alfalfa, and winter wheat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.

Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999

These soils are borderline mesic-frigid.  Future temperature studies are needed to resolve this issue.
