PINERUN SERIES 

The Pinerun series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains.  They formed in alluvium containing a high content of chert fragments.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Pinerun very gravelly silt loam - on a 1 percent slope in a pasture at an elevation of 1,055 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated) 

   A--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly silt loam; pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 45 percent chert gravel; 5 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick) 

   BA--6 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly silt loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; common very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic coating onfaces of peds; 31 percent chert gravel; 5 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick) 

   Bt1--11 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly silt loam; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; very few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 40 percent chert gravel; 10 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. 

   Bt2--18 to 29 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly silt loam; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; very few faint clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent chert gravel; 15 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); gradual smooth boundary. 

   Bt3--29 to 36 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very gravelly silt loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common fine black masses of iron and manganese accumulation on faces of peds; 47 percent chert gravel; 5 chert percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 20 to 45 inches) 

   Btb--36 to 60 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) extremely gravelly silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; few fine black masses of iron and manganese accumulation on faces of peds; 60 percent chert gravel; 10 percent chert cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.7).

Note: The 2Bt horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Btb horizon. Rock fragment content ranges from 25 to 80 percent; 25 to 80 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.
Note: Where the chroma is more than 4 in the lower horizons, the hue is 10YR.  

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinerun soils are on narrow flood plains in cherty limestone and dolomite areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium with a high content of chert fragments.  The mean annual temperature varies from 55 to 58 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 48 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Britwater, Goss, Moko, Scholten, Ocie, Rueter, Secesh, and Waben soils.  Britwater and Waben soils are on terraces.  Britwater soils have a fine-loamy particle size class and Waben soils have a lower base saturation.  Goss, Moko, Scholten, Ocie, and Rueter soils are on uplands.  Goss soils have a clayey-skeletal particle size class.  Moko soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.  Scholten soils have a fragipan.  Ocie soils have a strongly contrasting particle size class, and Rueter soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Secesh soils are on larger floodplains and have a fine-loamy particle size class. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low runoff, moderate permeability. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. These soils are subject to occasional flooding. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for pasture and hay.  A few areas are used for cultivated crops.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks region (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of southern Missouri and possibly north Arkansas. This series is of small extent.
