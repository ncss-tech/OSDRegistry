POVERTY SERIES 

The Poverty series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash derived from granite and gneiss. These soils are in drainageways and on outwash fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aeric Endoaquents

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - drainageways and outwash fans  
Elevation - 980 to 1,410 meters
Slope - 0 to 4 percent 
Parent material - alluvium and outwash   
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 330 to 432 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; moderately rapid permeability to 36 cm, rapid and very rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Poverty soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat, rangeland, and pasture. Some areas dry out sufficiently to permit the harvesting of hay in late summer. Native vegetation is mainly tall reedgrass, mannagrass, tufted hairgrass, willow, and mountain rush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Poverty soils are of small extent in mountain valleys of western Montana. MLRA 44A.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 13 cm (Oe and A horizons)
Redox concentrations - from 3 to 152 cm (A, Bw, C1, C2, and C3 horizons)
Aeric subgroup feature: moist color of 10YR 5/2 from - 28 to 75 cm (part of the C1, C2, and part of the C3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 28 to 103 cm (part of the C1, C2, and part of the C3 horizons)

Poverty soils have a frigid temperature regime, an aquic moisture regime, and an aeric moisture subclass.
