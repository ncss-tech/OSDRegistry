PINERID SERIES

The Pinerid series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from dolomitic limestone.  Pinerid soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pinerid very channery silt loam, on a south facing, complex, 16 percent slope in black sagebrush rangeland at an elevation of 7,800 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    The surface is covered by 35 percent channers and 5 percent flagstones.

    A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very channery silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse, medium and fine, common very fine roots; common fine and many very fine vesicular pores; 20 percent channers; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk1--2 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few coarse and medium, many fine and very fine roots; common fine and many very fine tubular pores; 50 percent channers; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as coatings less than 1 mm thick on undersides of rocks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk2--6 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, common fine and many very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 75 percent channery fragments; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as coatings 1 to 3 mm thick on underside of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk3--11 to 13 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, common fine and many very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 90 percent channery fragments; strongly effervescent, carbonates are 
disseminated and segregated as many medium irregular masses and coatings 1 to 3 mm thick on rocks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2; abrupt smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of Bk horizons is 4 to 8 inches thick)

    R--13 to 17 inches; unweathered dolomitic limestone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 30 miles northwest of Vernal, Utah; located about 650 feet north and 800 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 30, T. 1 S., R. 24 E., SLBM; Blair Basin USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 41 minutes 59 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 15 minutes 34 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  This soil occurs in a zone that is considered to have a typic ustic moisture regime.  However, due to the windswept nature of this soil's setting, it has an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Depth to calcic horizon:  6 to 12 inches
Depth to lithic contact:  10 to 20 inches to dolomitic limestone
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  7 to 9 inches after mixing
Surface rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent (predominantly channers derived from dolomitic limestone)

Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay; 60 to 80 percent rock fragments (predominantly channers derived from dolomitic limestone); 50 to 80 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the less-than-20 mm fraction

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  20 to 40 percent

Bk1 horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture:  silt loam with very channery or extremely channery modifiers
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  30 to 50 percent

Bk2 and Bk3 horizons:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture:  silt loam with extremely channery or extremely flaggy modifiers
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  50 to 60 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lap series.

Lap soils have Typic Ustic moisture control sections, and include hues of 2.5Y.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from dolomitic limestone.
Landform:  mountain slopes.
Slopes:  8 to 25 percent
Elevation: 7,500 to 9,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches.
Frost-free period:  70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clyl, Flynncove, and Cortyzack series.

Clyl soils are on mountain slopes and are very deep.
Flynncove soils are on fan remnants, have an argillic horizon, and are very deep.
Cortyzack soils are on dissected plateaus, are non-skeletal, and are very deep.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium and high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The potential native plant community is black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass, fringed sagewort, and prairie junegrass.  These soils have been correlated to Mountain Windswept Ridge (Black Sagebrush) - 047CY475UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is coined from a nearby geographic location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from the surface to 13 inches.  (A, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from the surface to 7 inches.  (A, Bw and the top inch of the Bk2 horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 13 inches.  (Bk2 and Bk3 horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with dolomitic limestone bedrock at 13 inches.

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."

Classification was changed from Lithic Calciborolls to frigid Lithic Calciustolls July 1998.
