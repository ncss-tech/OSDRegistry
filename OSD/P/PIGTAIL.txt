PIGTAIL SERIES

The Pigtail series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a duripan, that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  They are in depressions on terraces.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Abruptic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pigtail silt loam--on a slope of 2 percent under rangeland vegetation at 5,300 feet elevation.  When described on September 22, 1982, the soil was slightly moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine to medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine to medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt--7 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 22 inches thick)

    Bkq--18 to 32 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; violently effervescent (18 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt smooth boundary.  (9 to 25 inches thick)

    Bkqm--32 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/1) fractured duripan, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; platy; indurated; extremely hard, extremely firm; many 1/2 inch to 3 inch thick lime-silica cemented laminations with sandy loam soil material between the laminations; few very fine roots in fractures of the duripan; fractures are 1/4 inch wide and are 8 inches apart; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Twin Falls County, Idaho; about 20 miles west of Rogerson, Idaho; in the northeast 1/4, northwest 1/4, northeast 1/4, section 6, T. 14 S., R. 13 E.

Width of fractures - 1/4 to 1/2 inch
Distance between fractures - 7 to 20 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Catchell, Chilcott, Kepler, Lookout, Lovejoy, and Reno series.  Catchell soils are underlain by bedrock at a depth of less than 40 inches.  Chilcott soils have E horizons with silt loam or very fine sandy loam textures directly over the abrupt textural change and a duriapn with laminations of very strong or indurated plates less than 20 inches thick.  Kepler and Reno soils have duripans less than 20 inches thick.  Lookout soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the control section. Lovejoy soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pigtail soils are in depressions on terraces.  The slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Elevations are 4,600 to 5,500 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  The average annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost free season is 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Elijah, Roseworth, and Tanner soils.  Elijah, Roseworth, and Tanner soils occur on higher terraces.  Elijah soils are fine-silty.  Roseworth soils are shallow to a hardpan.  Tanner soils are frigid.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow runoff; very  slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pigtail soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is stunted Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Pigtail soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.
