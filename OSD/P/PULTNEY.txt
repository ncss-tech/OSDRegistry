PULTNEY SERIES

The Pultney series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in material high in carbonates and gypsum, which weathered from highly gypsiferous shale.  These gently sloping to moderatly steep soils are on upland.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) at the type location

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Pultney loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable; calcareous moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) thick)

  AC--10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) heavy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure that parts to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) thick)

  Ckz--23 to 61 centimeters (9 to 24 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) light clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable; visible calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and probably other salts occurring in fine crystals, as concretions, and in finely divided forms; calcium carbonate equivalent approximately 20 percent; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 86 centimeters (6 to 34 inches) thick)

  Cr--61 to 152 centimeters (24 to 60 inches); partially weathered calcareous gypsiferous shales. Variegated colors ranging from pale yellow (2.5Y 8/3) to light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3).

The hues of Bullpen soils are not as yellow.
Lithic contact: 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to sandstone bedrock

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: weathered residually from the underlying highly gypsiferous shale
Landform: upland hills and ridges 
Slope: 2 to 12 percent 
Mean annual temperature: 11 to 15 degrees C. (52 to 59 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 36 centimeters (14 inches)
Precipitation pattern: 20 to 23 centimeters (8 to 9 inches) of which falls during the months of April through August.
Frost-free period: 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kim, Midway, Ordway, Renohill and Shingle soils.
Kim soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.
Midway and Shingle soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 inches.
Ordway soils have more than 25 percent clay in the series control section.
Renohill soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is primarily used for rangeland and wheat production.  
Alkali sacaton, blue grama and galleta dominate the rangeland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Colorado and southeastern Montana. The series is of moderate extent.
