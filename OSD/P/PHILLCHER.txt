PHILLCHER SERIES 

The Phillcher series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and glacial drift derived from argillite and quartzite.  Phillcher soils are on mountain slopes, in basins, and in valley trains.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Phillcher ashy silt loam, forested (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    0i--0 inches to 2; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    Bw1--2 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots;  10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick) 

    2Bw2--12 to 26 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; 5 percent cobbles, 45 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 28 inches thick) 

    2C--26 to 62 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 10 percent cobbles, 55 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Missoula County, Montana, 1985 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0847.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Bw horizon); a cambic horizon from 10 to 24 inches (2Bw horizon); an ash influenced layer from the soil surface to 10 inches that has a moist bulk density of 1.0 g/cc or less (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (2Bw, 2C horizons). Phillcher soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
