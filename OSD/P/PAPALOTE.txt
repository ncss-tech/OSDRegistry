PAPALOTE SERIES

The Papalote series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium of Pleistocene and Pliocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on high terraces of inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Typic Paleustalfs

USGS topographic quadrangle: Ella, Texas; 
Latitude: 27 degrees 28 minutes 48.1 seconds N; 
Longitude: 98 degrees 03 minutes 41.3 seconds W. 
Datum: NAD 83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil Moisture: An ustic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 90 days in normal years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 72 to 74 (22.2 to 23.3 degrees F).
Depth to abrupt textural change: 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 71 to 102 cm (28 to 40 in)
Redoximorphic features: Iron depletions in the Bt1 horizon are due to present day wetness. This wetness, however, occurs less often than 6 out of 10 years. Features in the lower Bt horizon are considered either inherited from the parent material or are relict.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Gillett series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Delfina, Floresville, Griter, Leming, Miguel, and Wilco series.
Delfina soils: have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.
Gillett soils: are moderately deep to a sandstone Cr horizon.
Griter soils: do not have redox depletions within 76 cm (30 in) of the surface and formed in sediments weathered from sandstone, mainly of the Yegua Formation.
Floresville soils: have subsoils that are 5YR or redder in the upper part and have mixed mineralogy.
Leming soils: have sandy epipedons more than 50 cm (20 in) thick.
Miguel soils: do not have iron depletions.
Wilco soils: do not have carbonates within 100 cm (40 in) of the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy and clayey alluvium of Pleistocene and Pliocene age
Landscape: inland dissected coastal plains
Landform: high terraces of Pleistocene and Pliocene age
Slope: 0 to 5 percent but are dominantly less than 3 percent
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation mostly falls during the spring and fall months. The winter months are the driest.
Mean annual precipitation: 635 to 965 mm (25 to 38 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 31 to 48
Mean annual air temperature: 21.1 to 22.8 degrees C (70 to 73 degrees F) 
Frost-free period: 270 to 305 days
Elevation: 29.0 to 228.6 m (95 to 750 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Clareville, Floresville, Leming, Miguel, and Wilco series.
Clareville soils: have a mollic epipedon and occur on slightly lower positions. 
Floresville soils: do not have redoximorphic features and occur on slightly higher positions
Leming soils: have a sandy surface more than 50 cm (20 in) thick and occur on a similar landform
Miguel and Wilco soils: have a redder argillic horizon and occur on a similar landform

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes, and medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.  In fewer than 6 out of 10 years, this soil is saturated in the upper part of the Bt horizon for long duration. In some years, reduced conditions develop in the upper part of the argillic horizon for brief periods following extreme above-normal precipitation events (tropical storms). Redoximorphic features that result from these events are not diagnostic for classification.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Some areas are cropped to cotton, corn, and grain sorghum.  Most areas are in native range and improved pasture with coastal bermudagrass being the dominant pasture grass.  Native grasses include little bluestem, feathery bluestem, Nash and hooded windmillgrass, and Texas and plains bristlegrass.  Woody species consist of live oak, post oak, mesquite, huisache, spiny hackberry, and pricklypear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Rio Grande Plain (MLRA 83A; LRR I) of southern Texas.  The soil is extensive.
