PLEASANTVALLEY SERIES 

The Pleasantvalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till with a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash. These soils are on moraines, foothills, and mountain slopes in glaciated valleys. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Lesier - has horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - foothills, moraines, and mountain slopes in glaciated valleys. 
Elevation - 3,000 to 5,200 feet. 
Slope - 2 to 60 percent. 
Parent material - till. 
Climate - long, cold winters, moist springs, warm summers. 
Mean annual effective precipitation - 22 to 28 inches 
Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 44 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Winfall, Courville, Rockhill, and Sharrott series. Winfall soils are on similar positions and do not have an ash-derived mantle. Courville soils are on similar positions on northern aspects and have a lower bulk density, ash-derived mantle. Rockhill soils are on glacially scoured ridges, are ash-derived, and are shallow to bedrock. Sharrott soils are on glacially scoured ridges, have an ustic moisture regime and are shallow to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Pleasantvalley soils are used mainly for timber production, woodland grazing, and as wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting mainly of  Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine,  and ponderosa pine with an understory of kinnikinnick, pinegrass, white spirea, rough fescue, elk sedge, dwarf huckleberry, and Oregon grape. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Pleasantvalley soils are of limited extent in northwestern Montana. MLRA 43A. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana. 

SERIES PROPOSED: Flathead County, Montana, 2004. The name is taken from the name of a valley in the survey area.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ash influenced layer - 1 to 14 inches (E, Bw horizons);
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 14 inches (Oi, A, Bw horizons);
Albic horizon - 14 to 26 inches (2E horizon);
Cambic horizon - 26 to 60 inches (2E/Bw, 2E/Bt horizons); and 
Particle-size control section - 10 to 40 inches (Bw, 2E, 2E/Bw, 2E/Bt horizons).

Pleasantvalley soils have a udic moisture regime bordering on ustic and a frigid temperature regime.
