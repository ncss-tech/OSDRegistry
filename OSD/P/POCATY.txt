TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, thermic Typic Sulfisaprists 

TYPICAL PEDON: Pocaty peat - in a marsh at about sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described, the soil was saturated to the surface.) 

     0i--0 to 12 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) peat (fibric material) comprised of partially decomposed leaves, stems, and roots; about 75 percent fiber rubbed; massive; many fine and medium roots; weak sulfide odor; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 16 inches thick) 

     0e--12 to 20 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) mucky peat (hemic material); about 35 percent fiber rubbed; massive; many fine and medium roots; moderate sulfide odor; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 16 inches thick) 

     0a1--20 to 41 inches; black (10YR 2/1) muck (sapric material); about 15 percent fiber rubbed; massive; common fine and medium roots; flows easily between fingers when squeezed; moderate sulfide odor; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

     0a2--41 to 48 inches; black (10YR 2/1) muck (sapric material); less than 5 percent fiber rubbed; massive; few fine and medium roots; flows easily between fingers when squeezed; moderate sulfide odor; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

     0a3--48 to 60 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) muck (sapric material); less than 5 percent fiber rubbed; massive; flows easily between fingers when squeezed; moderate sulfide odor; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the 0a layer ranges from 40 to 80 inches) 

     2Cg--60 to 80 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam; massive; slightly sticky, non-plastic; flows easily between fingers when squeezed; slightly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: City of Virginia Beach, Virginia; approximately 4,800 feet east of intersection of Indian Creek Road and Blackwater Road, 900 feet north of Milldam Creek. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Thickness of Organic Matter: Greater than 51 inches Mineral strata less than 12 inches thick are in some pedons within the control section.
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches

Soil Reaction: Very strongly acid through neutral
Sulfur Content: Ranges from 0.75 percent to about 4.0 percent in individual layers within a depth of about 40 inches 
Conductivity: Conductivity of the saturation extract of layers at depths below about 6 inches is less than 16 mmho/cm 

Oe or Oa horizon upper tier:
Color--hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3
Texture--commonly is hemic or fibric, but ranges to sapric (muck) in some pedons 

Oa or Oe horizon lower tier:
Color--hue of 7.5YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 4

2Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 4 
Texture--commonly is loamy but ranges from sandy to clayey 
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)--iron masses in shades of brown, yellow, or red and iron depletions in shades of olive or gray

COMPETING SERIES: There are no known competing series
