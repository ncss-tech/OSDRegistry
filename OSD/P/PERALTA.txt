PERALTA SERIES

The Peralta series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Peralta loam--irrigated.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

     Ap--0 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    C1--10 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

    C2--16 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, sticky, plastic; common very fine roots; few fine faint brown (10YR 5/3) and few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; violently effervescent; few fine soft carbonate accumulations in root channels and other voids; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

     C3--20 to 28 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

    C4--28 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

    C5--40 to 45 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky, slightly plastic; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

    C6--45 to 65 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Sandoval County, New Mexico; about 1.5 mile northwest of Sandia Pueblo; 300 feet south and 1,980 feet east of the northwest corner of section 13, T. 12 N., R. 3 E.  106 degrees, 34 minutes, 44 seconds west longitude; 35 degrees, 16 minutes, 29 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture - The soil moisture control section is moist in some or all parts from March to October, and the soil is subject to a water table at depths of 24 to 36 inches during this period. Ustic moisture regime, oxyaquic subclass.  The soil is subject to rare or occasional flooding.

Depth to Redox Concentrations: 12 to 30 inches.
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent pebbles.
Particle-size Control Section Clay content:  Less than 18 percent by weighted average.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture: loam, clay loam, or loamy fine sand

C horizon
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 through 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: Stratified silt loam, clay loam, very fine sandy loam, coarse sand, loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand and loamy sand.
Salinity: 4 to 20 mmhos/cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Haigler and Kitcarson series. Haigler and Kitcarson soils receive peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months, and also receive about 14 to 17 inches of annual precipitation. Haigler soils also have SAR values greater than 15 within the particle-size control section.  (The Bosquecito series is also in this family, and the series concept is very close to Peralta.  The two series should be investigated to determine if they should be combined? The Bosquecito soils appears to have longer periods of saturation, are described with Cg horizons, and have intermediate amounts of mica in the coarse silt to fine sand fractions.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peralta soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources and are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevations range from 5,000 to 6,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aga, Gilco, and Jocity soils. These soils lack the high water table.  Aga soils have strongly contrasting particle-sizes within the control section. Gilco soils are dry in some or all parts of the SMCS from March to October.  Jocity soils have more than 18 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Peralta soils are used for irrigated cropland and pasture.  The present vegetation is alkali sacaton and saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern New Mexico.  Peralta soils are of small extent.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  A small amount also occurs in the very northern part of MLRA 42.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: BOZEMAN, MONTANA

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sandoval County, New Mexico; 1987.  Peralta is a local geographic name.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric Epipedon:  The zone between 0 and 10 inches (Ap)
Entisol feature:  No diagnostic subhorizons (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).
Fluventic feature:  Stratified textures and an irregular organic carbon distribution.
Redoximorphic Concentrations: C2, C3, C5 horizons

This soil was formerly classified as Typic Ustifluvents, before "Oxyaquic" was recognized in taxonomy.
