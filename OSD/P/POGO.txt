POGO SERIES

The Pogo series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Pogo soils are on flood plains and drainageways.   Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Pogo loam, on a 1 percent slope in a wet meadow.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ay--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine soft masses of gypsum; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Ckyg--2 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist, iron masses; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine soft masses and filaments of gypsum; few fine seams and filaments of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Cyg1--10 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist, iron masses; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine soft masses and filaments of gypsum; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Cyg2--20 to 28 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; many large distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist, iron masses; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine soft masses of gypsum; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Cg1--28 to 36 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist, iron masses; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    Cg2--36 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish red (5YR 4/6), moist, iron masses; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). 

TYPE LOCATION: Montezuma County, Colorado; about 4 miles north of Cortez; located about 300 feet east and 200 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 25, T. 16 N., R. 37 W.; Dolores west USGS quad; Lat. 37 degrees 25 minutes 42 seconds N. and long. 108 degrees 34 minutes 14 seconds W., NAD27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime: aquic
Soil temperature regime: mesic
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 50 degrees F
Depth to redox concentrations: 2 to 20 inches
Depth to redox depletions: 2 to 20 inches
Water table: depth is 0 to 20 inches, kind is apparent, months are March to September

Particle-size control section:
Clay content: 27 to 35 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 7 (3 to 5 moist)
Chroma: 0 to 2
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction: moderately or strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 5 to 7 (3 to 5 moist)
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: stratified with sand to silty clay to clay
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 15 percent
Reaction: moderately or strongly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Dobent series. Dobent soils average 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: alluvium derived from mixed sources
Landform: flood plains, and drainageways
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 5,400 to 7,500 feet
Mean annual temperature: 46 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 16 inches
Frost-free period: 100 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ackmen, Irak and Yarts soils.  All these soils are in drainageways but lack the presence of a watertable.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: poorly drained, medium runoff, moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Used principally for meadow hay or pasture.  Native plants are inland saltgrass, rushes, sedges, and broadleaf cattail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cortez Area, Colorado, Parts of Dolores and Montezuma Counties 1997. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Aquic feature: Matrix chroma of 2 within 20 inches of the surface.
Fluvaquent feature: An irregular decrease in organic matter with depth is assumed from stratification and the landscape position of this soil.
Redoximorphic features: Redox concentrations in the zone from 2 to 60 inches.
Water table: The presence of an apparent water table from 0 to 20 inches during spring and summer.
Particle size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches. (C1, C2, C3)
