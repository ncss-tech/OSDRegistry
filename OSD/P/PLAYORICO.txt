PLAYORICO SERIES


The Playorico series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite and/or sedimentary rock with occasional human transported material overtop. The Playorico soils are on flood plains. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F.) Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Playorico fine sandy loam on a south facing (180 degree), 1 percent slope at an elevation of -14 meters. When described on 04/21/2009 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

 ^A--0 to 23 inches, (0 to 58 cm); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown(2.5Y 3/2) moist; 10 percent clay; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; slight effervescence, by HCl, 1 normal; slightly alkaline, ph 7.4; abrupt smooth boundary.

 C1--23 to 35 inches, (58 to 90 cm); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown(2.5Y 4/2) moist; 80 percent sand; 5 percent clay; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; very slight effervescence, by HCl, 1 normal; neutral, pH 7.2 by Phenol red; abrupt smooth boundary.

 C2--35 to 43 inches, (90 to 108 cm); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silt loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; 25 percent sand; 10 percent clay; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; strong effervescence, by HCl, 1 normal; moderately alkaline, ph 8.0  clear wavy boundary.

 C3--43 to 61 inches, (108 to 155 cm); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; 60 percent sand; 10 percent clay; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; violent effervescence, by HCl, 1 normal; moderately alkaline, ph 8.2.

TYPE LOCATION:  Los Angeles County, Mae Boyer Park, Lakewood, CA. 33 degrees North latitude, 50 minutes, 43 seconds and 118 degrees, 6 minutes, 12 seconds West longitude, NAD83 - U.S.G.S Quad: Los Alamitos, California.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soil becomes moist below a depth of about 12 inches some time from October to December and remains moist in some part between depths of about 12 to 35 inches until April or May. 
Mean Annual Precipitation: 280 to 838 millimeters (11 to 33 inches
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (56 to 65 degrees F).
Mean Annual Soil Temperature: at 50 centimeters is 16 to 20 degrees C (60 to 68 degrees F). The soil temperature usually does not go below 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).
Rock fragments:	0 to 5 percent by volume and are rounded to sub-rounded, non-cemented to strongly cemented and typically only in the A horizons.
Artifacts: 	0 to 5 percent innocuous trash in the ^Au and ^Cu horizons.
Depth to bedrock:	 Depth is > 200 centimeters.
Reaction:	Slightly acid to neutral in the upper part and are slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part and are non-effervescent.  
Clay content:	5 to 16 percent. Rarely there is a horizon with 18 to 25 percent clay in the PSCS.
Thickness of Mollic:	52 to 180+ cm.                                                                            
PSCS Textures: 	Sandy loams, fine sandy loams, very fine sandy loams, loamy fine sands, sands, silt loams, silty clay loams and loams.
Depth to redoximorphic features: 55 to 200 centimeters

  Chroma: 3 dry; 2, 3 moist
  Texture of the fine earth fraction: Sandy loam
  Clay content: 10 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gorgonio, Paramount, Palmview and Pico soils.  Gorgonio and Paramount soils are sandy particle size families and have higher coarse fragment content. Palmview is non-fluventic. Pico has mollic thickness less than 50cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Playorico soils are on floodplains. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. These soils formed in occasional human transported material over alluvium derived from granite and/or sedimentary rock. Elevation is 5 to 30 meters. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 356 mm (14 inches). The mean annual air temperature is 17 degrees C. Frost free season is 355 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hueneme, San Emigdio, Paramount, Biscailuz, Tujunga, Elder, Gorgonio, San Emigdio soils. The Tujunga soils lack a mollic epipedon. Playorico and San Emigdio are coarse-loamy.  Elder is coarse-loamy and lacks carbonates.  Gorgonio lacks carbonates and typically has higher percentages of coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability, low runoff. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for residential lawns, landscaping, parks and urban development. Vegetation is landscaped, irrigated and non native plants and grasses. Historically vegetation was.. and was also farmed for seasonal row crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Playorico series is of moderate extent in MLRA 19 -- Southern California Coastal Plain.
