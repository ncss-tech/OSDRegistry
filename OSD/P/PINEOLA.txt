COMPETING SERIES
--Royce soils, which contain more silt and shale fragments in the particle-size control section
--Saunook soils, which are very deep to bedrock and formed in colluvial material
--Statler soils, which are very deep to bedrock and formed in alluvial material
--Trimont soils, which are very deep to bedrock and formed in residual material

Note:  Competing series have not been updated since most of these will also require reclassification using the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996).

LANDFORM: Ridges and hill slopes
LANDSCAPE POSITION (Hill slope component): Summits, shoulder slopes, and back slopes
LANDSCAPE POSITION (Geomorphic surface): Interfluve, nose slope, and side slopes
DEPTH CLASS: Moderately deep
DRAINAGE CLASS: Well drained
PERMEABILITY: Moderate
SURFACE RUNOFF CLASS: Medium on gentle slopes, high on strong or moderately steep slopes, and very high on steeper slopes--Runoff is much lower where forest litter has little or disturbance
PARENT MATERIAL: Residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks
MEAN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION (type location): About 55 inches

--Harmiller soils, which lack the humic extragrade feature, on similar landforms usually at lower elevations
--Whiteoak soils, which are very deep to bedrock and formed in colluvial material, on similar landforms and in small drains and coves

MAJOR USES: Woodland and a few small areas are used for cropland, pasture or hayland, and urban development

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

DOMINANT OVERSTORY SPECIES: Chestnut oak, white oak, scarlet oak, northern red oak, black oak, hickory, eastern white pine, with some Virginia pine and pitch pine

DOMINANT UNDERSTORY SPECIES: Rhododendron, mountain laurel, sourwood, blueberry, striped maple, greenbriar, red maple, black locust, flowering dogwood

DISTRIBUTION: North Carolina and Virginia and possibly Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee

EXTENT: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Avery County, North Carolina; 1997

REMARKS: Soils now included with the Pineola series were previously mapped with Harmiller soils. Harmiller soils do not have the a humic extragrade feature and have siliceous mineralogy.

The 1/98 revision places the Pineola series in a fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Humic Hapludults family.  CEC activity class placement is based on family placement of similar soils such as Trimont.  Additionally, depth to hard bedrock was changed from greater than 60 inches to greater than 40 inches.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon (humic feature) - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 7 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 26 inches (Bt and BC horizons)

Paralithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 32 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)

MLRA: 130 				SIR(s): NC0300

REVISED: 03/28/96-JAK; 1/98-DHK

2/2022 Oi layer was removed from the typical pedon description because /freshly fallen, or undecomposed leaf litter or simlar undeceomposed material should not be included as a surface layer in the soil description.  The typical pedon originally had a top layer described as undecomposed leaf material or similar undecomposed material. WJN

ADDITIONAL DATA: Mineralogy data is available from the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln NE; pedon number S95-NC-011-002.  However, initial analysis indicated paramicaceous mineralogy, but subsequent grain counts on the same samples, performed at the West Virginia University characterization lab by MO-13 personnel, indicate mixed mineralogy with only about 3 or 5 percent mica by grain count.
