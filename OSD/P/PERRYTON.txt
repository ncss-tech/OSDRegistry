PERRYTON SERIES

The Perryton series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey eolian sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level eolian plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19 in) and the mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).
