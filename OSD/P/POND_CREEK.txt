POND CREEK SERIES

The Pond Creek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy material high in silt and very fine sand which was derived from a combination of loess, alluvium, residuum from red beds. These soils occur on paleoterraces on broad uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and annual precipitation is 813 mm (32 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Argiustolls
