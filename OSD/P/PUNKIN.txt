PUNKIN SERIES 


The Punkin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey alluvium. These soils are on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters) and the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).
