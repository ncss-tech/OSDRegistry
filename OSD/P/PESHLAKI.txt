PESHLAKI SERIES

The Peshlaki series consists of very shallow and shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in tephra deposits over limestone residuum. Peshlaki soils are on structural benches and plateaus. Slopes range from 1 to 11 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches (304.8 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F. (11.1 degrees C.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, nonacid, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Peshlaki extremely gravelly coarse sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  C--0 to 1 inches (0 to 3 cm); very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) extremely gravelly coarse sand, black (7.5YR 2.5/1), moist; 2 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many interstitial pores; 65 percent cinders; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0; abrupt smooth boundary. 

  Bk--1 to 7 inches (3 to 18 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/2) very gravelly loamy sand, black (7.5YR 2.5/1), moist; 6 percent clay; massive and moderately fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many interstitial pores; common fine carbonate masses around rock fragments; 45 percent cinders; slightly effervescent, 1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.4; abrupt wavy boundary. 

  2R--7 inches (18 cm); fractured; weathered limestone bedrock

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Peshlaki soils are on structural benches and plateaus at elevations of 4,500 to 5,530 feet (1,373 to 1,685 meters). Slopes range from 1 to 11 percent. These soils formed on structural benches and plateaus of limestone residuum covered by tephra deposits. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches (254 to 356 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains and snowfall during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit (10.0 to 12.2 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 135 to 165 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chedeski (AZ), Flaco (AZ), Factory (AZ), and Meriwhitica (AZ) soils. Chedeski soils have a substantial sedimentary residuum layer, and a particle size control section having less than 35 percent sedimentary rock fragments. Flaco soils have calcic and argillic horizons, and are moderately deep from terrace deposits.  Factory soils have a petrocalcic horizon, and are moderately deep from terrace deposits. Meriwhitica soils do not have tephra, and form on cliffs and canyons.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low or negligible runoff; moderately rapid or rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes black grama, oneseed Juniper, galleta, lambert crazyweed and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. Peshlaki soils are of moderate extent. This soil is named after a spring near the type location. MLRA 35 Land Resource Unit 35.1.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wupatki National Monument, Coconino County, Arizona; Soil Survey of Coconino County Area, AZ, Central Part; 2012 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (0 to 18 cm) (C and Bk horizons)

Volcanic glass - exceeds 30 percent in mineral class control section

Lithic contact - the bounday at 7 inches (18 cm)

Pedons may have a thin C or Ck horizon of limestone from residuum beneath the tephra cover.
