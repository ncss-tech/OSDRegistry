COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Southern Florida Flatwoods
Landform(s): Low broad flats, depressions, drainageways, and floodplains 
Parent Material:  Sandy marine sediments
Mean annual air temperature: 20 to 25 degrees C (68 to 77 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 112 to 155 centimeters (44 to 61 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Basinger soils--lack umbric epipedons, have a spodic horizon, and are on similar landscape positions.
Immokalee soils--have Bh horizons more than 76 centimeters (30 inches) from the surface, are Spodosols, and are on similar landscape positions.
Myakka soils--have Bh horizons less than 76 centimeters (30 inches) from the surface, are Spodosols, and are on similar landscape positions. 
Pomello soils-are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained, have spodic horizons, are Spodosols, and are on slightly higher landscape positions.    
Pompano soils--lack umbric epipedons, do not have a Bh horizon, and are on similar landscape positions. 
Sellers soils have umbric epipedons more than 61 centimeters (24 inches) thick, lack a Bh horizon, and are on similar landscape positions.  
St. Lucie soils are excessively drained, lack umbric epipedons, and are on higher landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): Very high to high.
Permeability: Rapid  
Surface runoff: Negligible to very low
Ponding frequency and duration: Under natural conditions the soil is covered by water (ponded) - very frequently for very long duration for more than 6 months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major Uses: Water quality, forestry, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  Some areas are used for truck crops, citrus, and pasture.  
Dominant vegetation: Maidencane, sand cordgrass, pickerelweed, giant cutgrass, waxmyrtle, sedges, and rushes. Scattered cypress, bay, pond pine, blackgum, tupelo, and cabbage palm occur in some areas.
