Mean January air temperature--about -1 degree C
Mean July air temperature--20 to 22 degrees C
Mean annual air temperature--7 to 10 degrees C
Frost-free season--60 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Bridgewater--mollic epipedon 50 to 100 cm thick; loamy-skeletal in particle-size control section; on stream terraces under black cottonwood and hawthorn
Joseph--no mollic epipedon; on gravel bars and flood plains at lower elevations under annual forbs
Patit Creek--mollic epipedon 50 to 100 cm thick; coarse-loamy in particle-size control section; on stream terraces under black cottonwood and hawthorn

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained, moderately well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat)--high in mollic epipedon, very high below

Depth to seasonal water table--61 to 163 cm in December through April, 91 to 163 cm in November and May, below 112 cm in June through October

Oxygenated water seasonally passes through the soil profile in a lotic riparian system and does not produce visually observable anaerobic conditions.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Use--wildlife habitat, recreation, livestock grazing
Native vegetation--alder, black cottonwood, paper birch, snowberry, Woods' rose, arroyo willow, mallow ninebark, stinging nettle, field horsetail

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Oregon; MLRAs 9 and 10; small extent

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Umatilla Indian Reservation, Umatilla County, Oregon; 2016; name means alder in native Umatilla language

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from 0 to 33 cm
*Redoximorphic concentrations--zone from 33 to 150 cm
*Positive reaction to alpha-alpha dipyridyl--below a depth of 102 cm
*Organic carbon--irregular decrease with increasing depth
*Particle-size control section--zone from 26 to 101 cm
*Lithochromic colors associated with basalt parent material

04/2016--Because stream channels are incised, the soils are thought to be drier than natural conditions and redoximorphic features at a higher depth in the profile are assumed to be relict in some pedons. Drainage classes are assigned based on local knowledge of soil-vegetation correlation; no field hydrologic studies were conducted.

6/2016--This official series description was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
