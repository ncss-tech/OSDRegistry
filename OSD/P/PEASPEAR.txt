PEASPEAR SERIES

The Peaspear series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess-influenced alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone, calcareous siltstone, or calcareous mudstone.  These soils are on fan remnants, hillslopes, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

3/2008--This official series description was revised to reflect a change in classification from fine, smectitic Xeric Eutrocryepts to fine, smectitic Calcic Haplocryepts due to a revision of the Cryepts great group and subgroups in Soil Taxonomy.

5/2017--This official series description was revised to reflect a change in classification based on a description of the type location that now identifies an argillic horizon.
