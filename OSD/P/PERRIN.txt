PERRIN SERIES

The Perrin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy outwash underlain by sand and gravel on outwash plains, valley trains, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Perrin loamy sand, on a west-facing, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 3 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 E--20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 3 percent pebbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 Bt1--36 to 64 cm (14 to 25 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; thin clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--64 to 81 cm (25 to 32 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; thin clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 20 to 66 cm (8 to 26 inches).]

 2C--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sand; single grain; loose; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; common fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; 45 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Ionia County, Michigan, about 3 1/2 miles south of Ionia, 2,450 feet east and 375 feet south of the northwest corner of section 7, T. 6 N., R. 6 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the solum

Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5, 6 or more dry
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loamy sand or sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 3 to 25 percent gravel

A horizon, where present:
Thickness: 2.5 to 8 cm (1 to 3 inches)
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: loamy sand or sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 3 to 25 percent gravel

E horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma of 2 or 3
Texture: loamy sand or sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 3 to 25 percent gravel

Some pedons have a BA horizon.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 to 5
Texture: sandy loam or sandy clay loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures; where the texture is sandy clay loam, it is less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick and the control section averages less than 18 percent clay
Rock fragment content: 3 to 25 percent gravel

Some pedons have a BC horizon. 

2C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: typically very gravelly sand or gravelly sand, but ranges to coarse sand or fine gravel
Rock fragment content: 10 to 50 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dryden and Elmdale series. Dryden soils do not have dominant textures of sand (fine earth fraction) within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Elmdale soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Perrin soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, and ground moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. They formed in outwash that is high in quartz. Mean annual precipitation is 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean summer temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boyer, Coloma, Elmdale, Gilford, Hillsdale, Kalamazoo, Oshtemo, Spinks, and Wasepi soils. The well drained Boyer soils, the somewhat poorly drained Wasepi soils, and the very poorly drained Gilford soils are in the same drainage sequence. The somewhat excessively drained or excessively drained Coloma soils and the well drained Kalamazoo, Oshtemo, and Spinks soils are on nearby outwash plains and valley trains. The Coloma soils, the competing Elmdale soils, and the well drained Hillsdale soils are on nearby low moraines.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the A and B horizons and very rapid in the 2C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large amount is cropped to beans, corn, hay, and small grains. Lesser amounts are in permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is forest of basswood, beech, hickories, maples, and oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 99 in southern Michigan and northern Ohio. This series is of moderate extent.
