SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, Oregon; 2018

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 46 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from the surface to a depth of 33 cm
*Depth to lithologic discontinuity--33 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 46 cm

07/2017--The Puderbaughridge series is limited in extent, but it was proposed because of unique limestone geology. The pedon was described by Bob Ottersberg in 1999. It was assigned to the aridic soil moisture regime, but it does not align with the typical precipitation levels of that regime. The estimated precipitation for the series was lowered, but it is still high for the aridic moisture regime.
