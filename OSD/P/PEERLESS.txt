PEERLESS SERIES

The Peerless series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on fans and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amor, Azaar, Coulterg, Max, Minnimaud (t), Quigley, Rottulee, Roundup (t), Shambo, Tansum, and Twin Creek series.  The Amor, Minnimaud,and Roundup soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Azaar soils have hard sandstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Max, Coulterg, and Shambo soils do not have a calcic horizon and do not have more than 35 percent coarse fragments above a depth of 40 inches.  Quigley soils do not have more than 35 percent rock fragments above a depth of 40 inches.  Tansem soils have no rock fragments throughout the 60-inch profile.  Twin Creek soils have hue of 7.5YR and do not have more than 35 percent rock fragments above a depth of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peerless soils are on fans and terraces.  Elevations are 2,400 to 3,400 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 125 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Peerless soils are used mainly as rangeland and for nonirrigated crops.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Peerless soils are of small extent in southeastern Montana.
