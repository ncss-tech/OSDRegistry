Chroma--1
Texture--sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam with their shelly to extremely shelly analogs

COMPETING SERIES: Caricoche soils are on the same family.
Caricoche soils--occur on flood-tidal delta channels and the fragments consist of coral reef materials mixed with shells.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material--Loamy-skeletal estuarine deposits
Landscape--Coastal lagoons in semiarid coastal plain, Puerto Rico
Landform--Estuarine tidal creeks, streams and mainland cove (beach margins) 
Mean Annual Air Temperature--22 to 31 degrees C (71 to 88 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation--508 to 1,145 millimeters (20 to 45 inches)
Mean Annual Water Temperature--26 to 32 degrees C (79 to 90 degrees F)
Water salinity range--28 to 43 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Ostiones and Majaguas soils.
Ostiones soils--do not have a skeletal control section. Ostiones soils also occur in submerged mainland beaches outside the estuarine tidal stream which are more open to the lagoon. Majaguas soils--do not have a skeletal control section. Majaguas occur on lagoon bottom landforms which are deeper in the lagoon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous (permanently submersed)
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately high to high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic 
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Used for wildlife habitat, recreational boating, fishing, and swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish habitat.  These soils provide improved water quality and flood / storm surge water storage.
Dominant Vegetation--Common subaquatic vegetation (SAV) species include Halofila sp.(paddle grass) and blue green algae.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Coastal lagoons of Southern coastal plains of Puerto Rico
Land Resource Region--Z - Caribbean Region
MLRA--273 - Semiarid Coastal Plains
Extent--Small 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SPECIAL PROJECTS OFFICE

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humacao Area, Puerto Rico Eastern Part (PR689); Salinas Municipality, Puerto Rico; 2024. The name is from ponds in the Mar Negro area Estuary east of Las Mareas community, where it was originally recognized.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously published as water in Puerto Rico Soil Survey publications.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon--
Peraquic soil moisture regime--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 0 to 2 meters of salt water).
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 42 centimeters (0 to 17 inches).
Oxidized pH values--the shell fragments and Halimeda materials that occur throughout this soil buffer the oxidized pH preventing potential sulfidic materials from developing
High n-value--slightly to very fluid throughout
Skeletal--control section horizons have more than 35 percent average shell fragments.
