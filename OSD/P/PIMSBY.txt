PIMSBY SERIES

The Pimsby series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from arkose.  Pimsby soils are on hills on half grabens.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pimsby sandy loam - on a 12 percent slope in an area of woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed needles and twigs.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A--1 to 5 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    E--5 to 14 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) gravelly loamy coarse sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 22 inches thick)

    E and Bt--14 to 24 inches; 70 percent E part: light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; 30 percent Bt with lamellae: light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; lamellae of Bt are mainly about one-fourth to one-half inch thick and are approximately horizontal except along remnant root channels; 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt and E--24 to 47 inches; 70 percent Bt with lamellae: light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; 30 percent E part: light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse platy structure in some parts and weak coarse subangular blocky structure in other parts; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; lamellae of Bt are mainly about one-fourth to one-half inch thick and approximately horizontal except along remnant root channels and as coatings on pebbles; 45 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    C--47 to 60 inches; stratified reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) gravelly loamy coarse sand, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist, and light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; strata are about 1 to 6 inches thick; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.4).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Palon and Espanola series. These series have hue in the Bt that is yellower than 5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: slope alluvium from arkose, typically derived from the Fountain Formation.
Landform: hills on half grabens
Slopes: 5 to 40 percent
Elevation: 8,200 to 8,600 feet
Mean annual temperature: 42 to 44 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 22 inches
Precipitation pattern: Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period: 80 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Plome soils.  Plome soils have an argillic horizon that is not composed of lamellae and average less than 35 percent gravel by volume in the family particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for urban land, livestock grazing, and recreation.  Native vegetation is ponderosa pine and some Douglas-fir and quaking aspen with an understory of Arizona fescue, common juniper, pine dropseed, kinnikinnick, sedges, mountain muhly, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A;  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Teller County (Teller-Park Soil Survey Area), Colorado, 2010. The name is coined.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the E, E and Bt, and part of the Bt and E horizons)
Ochric epipedon: from 1 to 5 inches. (A horizon)
Albic horizon: from 5 to 14 inches. (E horizon)
Argillic horizon composed of lamellae: from 14 to 47 inches. (E and Bt, Bt and E horizons)

There is some nearby data in this parent material that indicates the CE activity class is active and perhaps semiactive.  This needs to be investigated.

Taxonomic Version: classified according to the Eleventh edition, 2010.
