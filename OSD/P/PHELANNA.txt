COMPETING SERIES: There are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: swales on mountains; swales on till plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly till
Elevation: 2,782 to 3,442 feet (848 to 1,049 m)
Slope: 2 to 12 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 35 inches (712 to 894 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Basaltlake and McCumbersome soils. Basaltlake soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains. McCumbersome soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is diamondleadf willow scrub, moist.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
