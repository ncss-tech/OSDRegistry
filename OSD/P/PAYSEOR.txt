PAYSEOR SERIES

The Payseor series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey till overlying loamy till on till plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow in the clayey material and moderate or moderately slow in the loamy material.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

Members of the typical drainage sequence (catena) with Payseor include 
Froberg and Matchwood.

Drainage  a perched seasonal zone of water saturation is at 0 to 46 centimeters from March to June and from 46 to 61 centimeters during October and November (somewhat poorly drained).  Another zone of water saturation is at 137 to 203 centimeters every month except August.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ap, A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons) - very slow
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2C horizons) - moderate or moderately slow

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested with red maple, quaking aspen, white pine, white spruce and balsam fir.  Some areas are in pasture or hay land.
