PINERY SERIES

The Pinery series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in gravelly fan alluvium from limestone parent material. Pinery soils are on moderately sloping to moderately steep alluvial fans. Slopes are 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 411 mm (16 in).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Culberson County, Texas; 2010. The name is from a Butterfield Trail stage coach stop that is in the park. 

REMARKS:  
The series was reclassified with the correlation of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park soil survey.  The type location was moved after analysis of the pedon descriptions and control section indicated a Pachic subgroup and carbonatic mineralogy was representative for the series as correlated in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park also .

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 59 cm (0 to 23.2 in) (A horizon)
Calcic horizon: 9 to 200 cm (3.5 to 78.7 in) (Bk horizons)    
Carbonatic mineralogy in particle size control section 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) (Bk2 and Bk3 horizons)
