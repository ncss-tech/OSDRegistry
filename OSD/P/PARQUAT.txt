PARQUAT SERIES

The Parquat series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium derived from volcanic sources.  Parquat soils are on hills and fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Parquat extremely cobbly sandy loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 25 percent pebbles, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few medium and fine roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--12 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 9 inches thick)

    2Bk--19 to 33 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very cobbly sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and fine roots; 15 percent pebbles, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; violently effervescent; 55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; horizon engulfed by carbonates; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 18 inches thick)

    2C--33 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; 20 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Catron County, New Mexico; about 7 miles southwest of Pietown, on Bar W Ranch, on hill .4 mile northeast of Mann Tank, in northwest 1/4, southwest 1/4, sec. 8, T. 1 S., R. 13 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section July through September and November through March.  The soil is driest during May and June. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  49 to 56 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon:  less than 20 inches thick

Depth to calcic horizon:  19 to 30 inches

Percent clay in the particle-size control section:  35 to 45 percent on a weighted average

Rock fragments in the particle-size control section:  35 to 75 percent on a weighted average (15 to 35 percent pebbles, 10 to 35 percent cobbles, 0 to 20 percent stones)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goldust (NM), Stroupe (NM), Tafoya (NM) and Veldkamp (CO) series.  Goldust, Tafoya, and Veldkamp soils lack a calcic horizon.  Stroupe soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Parquat soils are on hills and fan terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Elevation ranges from 7,600 to 8,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is about 115 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alegros, Majada and the competing Tafoya series.  Alegros soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Majada soils have loamy-skeletal control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal use is for grazing and the production of wood products.  Present vegetation is pinyon, juniper, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This series is of moderate extent in west-central New Mexico. MLRA 35.
