PACKERJOHN SERIES

The Packerjohn series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 4 to 90 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Packerjohn ashy coarse sandy loam, forested -- on a north-facing slope of 65 percent at 4,400 feet elevation. When described on July 7, 1998, the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed forest litter.

   Al--2 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 10 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary.

   A2--10 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 20 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. (combined A horizon - 10 to 20 inches thick)

   Bw--19 to 33 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 20 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 25 inches thick)

   2C1--33 to 44 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine gravelly loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 25 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

   2C2--44 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 35 percent fine gravel; few distinct 2-5 mm wide dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) discontinuous lamellae; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

   2C3--60 to 66 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) very gravelly coarse sand, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 50 percent gravel; few distinct 2-10 mm wide dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) discontinuous lamellae; moderately acid (pH 5.9).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Karamin and Orwig series. Karamin soils do not have an umbric epipedon and have 0 to 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Orwig soils do not have an umbric epipedon and have E horizons less than 1 inch thick directly over a Bw horizon with 0 to 10 percent gravel.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Packerjohn soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 3,200 to7,000 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 4 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 36 inches. The average annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pajo, Shirts and Tripod soils. Pajo and Tripod soils are sandy-skeletal. Shirts soils are coarse-loamy and moderately deep. These soils are on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; slow to rapid runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Packerjohn soils are used mainly for timber production and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, mountain maple, mallow ninebark, white spirea and thinleaf (blue) huckleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43B. Packerjohn soils are not extensive.
