PERNITAS SERIES

The Pernitas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium derived from sandstone of Pleistocene and Pliocene ages.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on summits, backslopes, and footslopes of ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Some areas are crop production, mostly for grain sorghum.  Present vegetation includes pink pappusgrass, lovegrass tridens, fall witchgrass, hooded windmillgrass, and plains bristlegrass.  Woody vegetation includes mesquite, catclaw, spiny hackberry, and blackbrush, and guallijo. The ecological site is Gray Sandy Loam, 20-35"PZ (R083CY456TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central portion of the Rio Grande Plain of Texas (MLRA 83A, 83C).  The series is of large extent.
