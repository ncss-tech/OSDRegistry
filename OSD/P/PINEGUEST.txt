PINEGUEST SERIES

The Pineguest series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed family of Psammentic Cryoboralfs. Typically, Pineguest soils have very pale brown platy A2 horizons, light yellowish brown gravelly coarse sandy loam horizons in which silicate clay is accumulating as lamellae, and light yellowish brown noncalcareous coarse sand C horizons.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Lamellic Haplocryalfs

TYPIFYING PEDON:  Pineguest sandy loam, forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    O1--3 inches to 1 inch; undecomposed needles, bark, and twigs.

    O2--1 inch to 0; partially decomposed organic material like that of the overlying horizon.

    A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine crumb structure; soft, very friable; few charcoal fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly coarse loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure that parts to moderate fine granules; slightly hard, very friable; 15 to 20 percent gravel, mostly fine and very fine angular granite gravel; medium acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    A&B--10 to 15 inches; mixed very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, loose; this horizon consists of thin seams and nodules of clayey material imbedded in material like the overlying horizon; 20 percent fine and very fine angular granite gravel; medium acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    B2t--15 to 26 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, loose; the horizon consists of seams and lamellae of sandy clay loam or clay loam 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick in a loamy coarse sand matrix; thin, nearly continuous wax-like coatings on faces of peds in lamellae; wax-like coatings on sand grains; 20 percent fine and very fine angular granite gravel; medium acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 13 inches thick)

    B3--26 to 31 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, loose; some glossy coatings on sand grains and coarse fragments; 20 percent fine and very fine angular granite gravel; medium acid (pH 5.8); diffuse wavy boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    C--31 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, loose; medium acid (pH 5.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Johnson County, Wyoming; SW1/4 SW1/4 sec. 24, T.47N., R.85W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 20 to 50 inches thick.  Organic carbon ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the A1 horizon but decreases rapidly but uniformly with increasing depth. The soil is 60 to 80 percent base saturated. These soils have a very low volume change on wetting and drying and have very hard semi-cemented consistence when air dry in the horizons of low organic matter content. packing patterns of sand grains in the soil fabric tend to be cubical or rhomboidal.  Rock fragments range from about 15 to 35 percent, most of which are fine and very fine angular granite fragments. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F. with an O horizon at least 4 inches thick and good crown cover. The A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has platy primary structure but has subangular blocky or granular structure in some pedons. This horizon is hard or slightly hard and medium or slightly acid. The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5. The lamellae in the horizon are principally sandy clay loam or light clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 45 to 70 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand, and with a high percentage of medium and coarse angular granite fragments. Oriented clay films occur in some lamellae. This horizon is medium or slightly acid. The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is slightly or medium acid.

COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Sanford and Tex series. Sandford soils have bedrock above a depth of 40 inches. Tex soils have less than 60 percent base saturation in some part of the argillic horizon and contain more coarse and medium angular sand and fine granitic gravel.

SETTING:  These soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans or glacial outwash terraces in which the parent material has been derived principally from granite bedrock. Slopes usually range from 2 to 20 percent. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 22 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. The average annual temperature is 34 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 52 degrees F.

PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Woodrock and Mathers soils.  Both of these soils have continuous argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native pasturelands, recreation or for forestry purposes. Principal native vegetation is lodgepole pine with an understory of grass and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Bighorn Mountain areas of north-central Wyoming. The series is of moderate extent.
