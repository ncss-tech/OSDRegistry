PINEGUEST SERIES

The Olathe series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  Pineguest soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans or glacial outwash terraces with slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Lamellic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pineguest sandy loam, forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; undecomposed needles, bark, and twigs.

    Oe--5 to 8 cm; partially decomposed organic material like that of the overlying horizon.

    A--8 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine crumb structure; soft, very friable; few charcoal fragments; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

    E--13 to 33 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly coarse loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure that parts to moderate fine granules; slightly hard, very friable; 15 to 20 percent gravel, mostly fine and very fine angular granite gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    E/B--33 to 46 cm; mixed very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, loose; this horizon consists of thin seams and nodules of clayey material imbedded in material like the overlying horizon; 20 percent fine and very fine angular granite gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--46 to 74 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, loose; the horizon consists of seams and lamellae of sandy clay loam or clay loam 1 to 2 cm thick in a loamy coarse sand matrix; thin, nearly continuous wax-like coatings on faces of peds in lamellae; wax-like coatings on sand grains; 20 percent fine and very fine angular granite gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 33 cm thick)

    BC--74 to 87 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, loose; some glossy coatings on sand grains and coarse fragments; 20 percent fine and very fine angular granite gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); diffuse wavy boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

    C--87 to 161 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, loose; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Johnson County, Wyoming; southwest quarter of the southwestSW1/4 SW1/4 sec. 24, T.47N., R.85W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature--0 to 8 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature--4 degrees to 8 degrees C with an O horizon at least 10 cm thick and good crown cover
These soils have a very low volume change on wetting and drying and have very hard semi-cemented consistence when air dry in the horizons of low organic matter content. Packing patterns of sand grains in the soil fabric tend to be cubical or rhomboidal.
Solum thickness--50 to 125 cm
Organic carbon content--1 to 3 percent in the A horizon, decreasing rapidly but uniformly with increasing depth
Base saturation content--60 to 80 percent
Rock fragment content--15 to 35 percent, most of which are fine and very fine angular granite fragments

E horizon 
Hue--2.5Y or 10YR
Value--5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma--2 through 4
Structure--platy primary structure but has subangular blocky or granular structure in some pedons
Rupture resistance-- hard or slightly hard 
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 6.5

Bt horizon
Hue--2.5Y through 7.5YR
Value--5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma--3 through 5
Texture of lamellae--sandy clay loam or light clay loam
Clay content of lamellae--18 to 35 percent
Sand content--45 to 70 percent, with more than 35 percent fine sand, and with a high percentage of medium and coarse angular granite fragments. 
Oriented clay films occur in some lamellae. 
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 6.5

C horizon
Hue--2.5Y or 10YR
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 6.5

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Sanford and Tex series. Sandford soils have bedrock above a depth of 100 cm. Tex soils have less than 60 percent base saturation in some part of the argillic horizon and contain more coarse and medium angular sand and fine granitic gravel.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform--gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans or glacial outwash terraces
Elevation--1950 to 2800 meters
Slope--2 to 20 percent
Parent material-slope alluvium and/or residuum derived from granite bedrock
Mean annual precipitation--560 mm, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months
Mean annual air temperature--1 degrees C
Mean summer temperature--11 degrees C
Frost-free period--50 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native pasturelands, recreation or for forestry purposes. Principal native vegetation is lodgepole pine with an understory of grass and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Pineguest soils are of small extent in the Bighorn Mountain area of north-central Wyoming and the mountains of northcentral Colorado; MLRAs 43B and 48A.
