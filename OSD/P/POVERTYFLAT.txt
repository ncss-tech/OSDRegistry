POVERTYFLAT SERIES

The Povertyflat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from rhyolite and andesite.  Povertyflat soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.
