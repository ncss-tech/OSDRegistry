PENISTAJA SERIES

The Penistaja series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soil that formed in mixed alluvium, fan alluvium, slope alluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone and shale. Penistaja soils are on mesas, plateaus, hills, cuestas and bajadas. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Balon (AZ), Blancot (NM), Bowbac (WY), Buckle (NM), Cambria (WY), Cerropelon (NM), Chilerojo (NM), Chilojo (NM), Cumacho (NM), Cushman (WY), Decolney (WY), Doakum (NM), Forkwood (WY), Fort (CO), Gaddes (AZ), Gapbutte (AZ), Gapmesa (CO), Hagerman (NM), Hagerwest (NM), Hiland (WY), Mentmore (NM), Oelop (NM), Olney (CO), Palacid (NM), Pokeman (WY), Potts (WY), Pugsley (WY), Quagwa (AZ), Redpen (NM), Spangler (WY), Sundance (CO), Tamarindo (NM), Teckla (WY) and Yenlo (CO) series. Balon soils are noneffervescent throughout.  Blancot and Yenlo soils have hue of 10YR and 2.5Y.  Bowbac, Cambria, Cushman, Delconey, Forkwood, Hiland, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler and Teckla soils are moist in May and June.  Buckle, Oelop and Palacid soils contain less than 40 percent sand.  Doakum soils average less than 1 percent organic matter in the upper 16 inches.  Quagwa soils contain less than 25 percent sand.  Cerropelon, Cumacho, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, and Hagerwest soils have bedrock at moderate depths.  Chilerojo, Fort, Olney, Sundance and Tamarindo soils attempt to reflect the effects of soil forming agents unique to the Great Plains.  Redpen soils have 2.5YR hue.  Mentmore soils have 2.5Y hue.  Chilojo soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Penistaja soils are on mesas, plateaus, hills, cuestas and bajadas. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. They formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, slope alluvium and eolian material derived principally from sandstone and shale. Elevations range from 4,800 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 49 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 115 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bond, Hagerman and Querencia soils. Querencia soils do not have argillic horizons. Bond soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches. Hagerman soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Penistaja soils are used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is blue grama, western wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, galleta, winterfat and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern New Mexico and northeastern Arizona. MLRA 35 and 36, LRR-D.  This series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County (Santa Fe Area), New Mexico, 1970.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizons: The zone from 2 to 22 inches (Bt horizons)

The type location of the Penistaja series was moved from Sandoval County to Cibola County in 1983 to better reflect the present concept of the Penistaja series.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006

The Penistaja and Doakum series were originally classified in Ustollic and Ustalfic subgroups, respectively.  A later revision to Soil Taxonomy combined these into one Ustic subgroup resulting in duplication of series differentia and inconsistent field mapping. Surface organic matter content has been better defined as differentia but the Doakum series may need to be inactivated if concept confusion persists after 7/2007
