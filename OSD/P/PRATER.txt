PRATER SERIES

The Prater series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, and alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Prater soils are on canyons, hills, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Prater loam, on an east facing, 22 percent slope in pinyon juniper woodland at an elevation of 7,560 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 8 percent gravel, 3 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones.

    A1--0 to 1 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 1 percent stones; neutral (7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

(3 to 12 inches thick)

    Btk3--21 to 37 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; moderate fine angular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and common fine roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; many distinct continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common coarse irregular soft masses of carbonate throughout; strongly effervescent; 5 percent gravel, 4 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Durango, Erramouspe, Fikel, Hosta, Hualapai, Jacee, Montecito, Nogal, Paguate, Teco, Tinian and Wilmac series. Durango soils are 7.5YR and redder in the Bt horizon. Erramouspe, Hualapai, Jacee, Nogal, Paguate, Tinian, and Wilmac soils are moderately deep.  Hosta soils contain less than 5 percent coarse fragments in any horizon. Montecito and Teco soils have a calcic horizon and would be reclassified as Calcidic Haplustalfs.
