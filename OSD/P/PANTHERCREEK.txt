PANTHERCREEK SERIES

The Panthercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in debris flow colluvium derived from schist. Panthercreek soils are on stabilized debris slides on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: At this time there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Panthercreek soils are on stabilized debris slides on steep-sided mountain slopes near creeks. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 15 to 757 meters (45 to 2480 feet). These soils formed in debris flow colluvium derived from schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C.; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C., and mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coppercreek and Devilscreek soils. Coppercreek and Devilscreek soils are fine-loamy. The Coppercreek soils are on gentler, drier slopes above the Panthercreek soils. The Devilscreek soils are near drainage headwaters upstream from the Panthercreek soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife and watershed. Natural vegetation includes redwood, western hemlock, tanoak, Douglas fir, big-leaf maple and red alder in the overstory, and rhododendron, huckleberry, salmonberry, thimbleberry, swordfern, deer fern, woodsorrel and coltsfoot in the understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

4. Aquic conditions - seasonal water table and depleted matrix in the zone from 171 to 226 centimeters (Cg horizon)
5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters, (Bw, C1 and C2 horizons) averages 11 percent clay, by weight, and 52 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.38.
