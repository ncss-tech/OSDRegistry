POIA SERIES

The Poia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in outwash, till or mass movement deposits derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Poia soils are commonly found on landslides, moraines or depressions on glacial-valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,000 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Poia loam on a 15 percent slope, west aspect at 1,400 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; abrupt smooth boundary.  

 A--2 to 14 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) loam, very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, and common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.                                              

 Bt1--14 to 36 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, and common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 25 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), moist, masses of oxidized iron on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.9); clear wavy boundary.                    

 Bt2--36 to 74 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm, hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, and common fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 30 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 20 percent fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist, masses of oxidized iron on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.                            

 Bt3--74 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, and common fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist, masses of oxidized iron on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).
