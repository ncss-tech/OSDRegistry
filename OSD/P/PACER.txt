PACER SERIES

The Pacer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in poorly sorted outwash and the underlying loamy till of medium or high lime content. These soils are on outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls

[0 to 51 cm (20 inches) thick]

 2Cd--168 to 203 cm (66 to 80 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; massive; firm; common distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) carbonate coatings on horizontal and vertical partings; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; few medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron and manganese nodules in the matrix; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corwin, Foresman, Parr, Prairieville, and Tippecanoe series. Corwin and Foresman soils average less than 10 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Parr soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Prairieville soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Tippecanoe soils have more than 14 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pacer soils are on treads on outwash terraces of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in poorly sorted loamy outwash 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) thick over loamy till of medium or high calcium carbonate content. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1067 mm (31 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gallman, Glynwood, Millgrove, and Pewamo soils. The well drained Gallman soils are on slightly higher parts of the landscape. The very poorly drained Millgrove soils are on slightly lower parts of the landscape. Glynwood and Pewamo soils have more clay in the control section. Glynwood soils are on adjacent uplands and the very poorly drained Pewamo soils are in upland drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately slow or slow in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grains, and forages are the principal crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Ohio; MLRA 111B. The series is of small extent, with about 1,000 acres.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Delaware County, Ohio, 1996.

REMARKS: The Pacer series has been considered as an inclusion in Thackery, Sleeth, and Westland soils in Delaware County.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (Ap, A horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 36 to 129 cm (Bt horizon).
Densic contact: at 168 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 66 cm.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence of densic materials in the 2Cd horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for DL-56, the typical pedon.
