PAHUK SERIES

The Pahuk series consists of very deep excessively drained soils formed in sandy alluvium and outwash material. These soils are on paleo valley side slopes and glaciated uplands with slopes of 5 to 17 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pahuk loamy fine sand, with a southwest facing 7 percent slope, in abandoned cropland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine roots throughout; common fine and medium tubular pores; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches) thick)

  AC--15 to 36 centimeters (6 to 14 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; single grain; loose; few fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

  C1--36 to 102 centimeters (14 to 40 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; single grain; loose; few fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

  C2--102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; few fine prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) soft masses of iron accumulation; single grain; loose; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Saunders County, Nebraska; about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) east and 1.6 kilometers (1 mile south of Wahoo; 140 meters (460 feet) west and 69 meters (225 feet) north of the southeast corner of section 11, T. 14 N., R. 7 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acquango, Aldo, Bigapple, Biltmore, Boplain, Breeze, Caesar, Chute, Dabney, Hodge, Oakville, Osolo, Penwood, Perks, Pinegrove, Plainfield, Poquonock, Samoa, Sardak, Sarpy, Scotah, Spessard, Suncook, Tyner, and Windsor soils. 
Acquango soils formed in sandy aeolian and marine sediments and are located on backshore and dune areas of barrier islands of the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. 
Aldo soils have an apparent seasonal high water table, 107 to 183 centimeters (3.5 to 6 feet) below the surface, for 1 month or more per year.
Bigapple and Breeze soils are anthrotransported material greater than 102 centimeters (40 inches).  
Biltmore, Hodge, Perks, Sarpy and Suncook soils are on the floodplain and are subject to flooding.
Boplain soils have a paralithic contact within the series control section.   
Caesar, Oakville, Penwood, Plainfield, Spessard, Tyner and Windsor soils have a noncambic pedogenic Bw horizon.  
Chute, Sardak, and Sarpy soils contain free carbonates.
Dabney soils are substantially wetter in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice. 
Osolo soils have a solum thickness of 152 to 203 centimeters (60 to 80 inches) or more. 
Pinegrove soils formed in acid regolith and contain fragments of sandstone from surface mining operations.
Plainfield, Scotah, and Tyner soils have Bw horizons with hues of 10YR and 7.5YR. 
Poquonock soils have a solum thickness and depth to the densic contact ranges from 51 to 97 centimeters (20 to 38 inches).
Samoa soils are on recently stablized dunes on dune fields and coastal plains.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: Sandy aluvium and outwash material of Pleistocene age.
Landform: Uplands
Slopes: 5 to 17 percent
Mean annual temperature: 11 to 12 degrees C. (51 to 54 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 71 to 81 centimeters (28 to 32 inches)
Frost-free period: 160 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Judson, Olmitz and Pohocco soils.  
Judson and Olmitz soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick, have more silt and clay in the control section, and are on foot slopes.  
Pohocco soils have more silt and clay in the control section, have carbonates at depths of 12 to 40 inches, and are slightly higher on the back slope.
