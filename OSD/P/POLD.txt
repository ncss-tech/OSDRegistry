POLD SERIES

The Pold series consists of very deep soils that are moderately deep to a fragipan. They are moderately well drained and found on hill slopes and interfluves. The soils formed in loess and Tertiary age alluvium with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low in the fragipan, moderately low in the glossic horizon and moderately high and high in the overlying material. Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent. The average annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C. and the average annual precipitation is about 889 mm.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Pold soils are on hill slopes and interfluves.  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in loess and Tertiary age alluvium with a thick mantle of volcanic ash at elevations of 823 to 1039 meters.   The average annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 8.0 degrees C, with an average annual precipitation of 790 to 990 mm.  The frost free season is 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Neva, Hugus, Carrico and Teakean series. Neva soils are on hillslopes with a thinner volcanic ash mantle. They do not have a fragipan and have granitic residuum in the subsoil. Hugus soils are on mountain slopes. They do not have a fragipan and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. Carrico soils are on mountain slopes. They do not have a distinct ash cap and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Teakean soils are on mountain slopes. They do not have a distinct ash cap and are deep to a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low in the fragipan, moderately low in the glossic horizon and moderately high and high in the overlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is grand fir (Abies grandis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), with an understory of oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), pinegrass (Calamagrostis rubescens), common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), mallow ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), dwarf rose (Rosa gymnocarpa) and starry Solomon's seal (Smilacina stellata)

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Idaho. The series is not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
