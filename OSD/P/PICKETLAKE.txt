PICKETLAKE SERIES

The Picketlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or alluvium derived from conglomerate.  These soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Picketlake sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 13 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick).

    Bk1--10 to 20 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 30 percent carbonate coats on the underside of rock fragments; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; 3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (9 to 37 cm thick).

    Bk2--20 to 38 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; carbonate coats on rock fragments; 5 percent irregular carbonate masses throughout; 12 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk3--38 to 65 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 30 percent carbonate coats on rock fragments; 20 percent irregular carbonate masses throughout; 18 percent gravel; violently effervescent; 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bk2 and Bk3 - 25 to 50 cm)

    BCk--65 to 150 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; very few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 30 percent carbonate coats on rock fragments; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
