PETTY SERIES

The Petty series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over material derived mainly from granite and gneiss. Petty soils are on mountain slopes and broad ridgetops. Slopes are 8 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

USE AND VEGETATION: Petty soils are used for timber production and watersheds and as wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is subalpine fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine with an understory of twinflower, blue huckleberry, queencup beadlily, rusty menziesia, and grouse whortleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Petty soils are moderately extensive in western Montana and northern Idaho.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in
this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (Bw horizon); a cambic horizon from 27 to 39 inches (2E and Bt horizon); a soil layer from the mineral soil surface to 15 inches that has a moist bulk density of 1.0 g/cc or less (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, 2E, 2E and Bt, 2C horizons). Petty soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
