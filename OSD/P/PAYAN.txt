PAYAN SERIES

The Payan series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium or colluvium weathered from multi-colored, non-calcareous shale and sandstone.  Payan soils are on hillslopes, ridges, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Payan cobbly sandy clay loam, on a southwest facing, complex, 30 percent slope in pinyon-juniper woodland at an elevation of 1,859 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on May 6, 1987 the soil was moist from 0 to 46 cm. 

     A--0 to 13 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) cobbly sandy clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

     Bw--13 to 30 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist and crushed; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 41 cm thick)

     C--30 to 46 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist and crushed; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent paragravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

     Cr--46 to 71 cm; gray shale, weathered in upper part.
