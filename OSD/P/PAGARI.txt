PAGARI SERIES

The Pagari series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material.  Pagari soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calciargidic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Pagari very cobbly sandy loam on a 6 percent east facing slope at an elevation 4,640 feet in rangeland.  When described on June 16, 1981, the profile was moist to 40 inches.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; about 10 percent stones, 40 percent cobbles, and 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 10 percent stones, 40 percent cobbles, and 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.

(0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--17 to 31 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores and bridging sand grains; about 10 percent stones, 40 percent cobbles, and 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bk1--31 to 36 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; about 10 percent stones, 40 percent cobbles, and 15 percent pebbles; slight effervescence (about 10 percent calcium carbonate); slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk2--36 to 46 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely cobbly loam, pale brown (10YR6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; about 10 percent stones, 40 percent cobbles, and 15 percent pebbles; violently effervescence (about 20 percent calcium carbonate); slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt irregular boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Belmill, Eenreed, Kancan, Mountainville, Red Butte, Selti, and Walsey series.  Belmill soils are very deep.  Eenreed soils are very deep and are 7 to 16 inches to the Bk horizon.  Kancan soils are very deep and have a lithologic discontinuity below the argillic horizon.  Mountainville soils are moderately or strongly alkaline in the calcic horizon and rock fragments in the soil are dominated by stones.  Selti soils are very deep and have less than 60 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Red Butte soils are less than 20 inches deep to the base of the argillic and are weakly to strongly cemented in the calcic horizon.  Walsey soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pagari soils are on basalt plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,400 feet to 4,800 feet.  The soil formed in eolian material over basalt.  The climate is semi-arid with annual precipitation of 10 to 13 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cox, Deerhorn, McCarey, Molyneux, Pedleford, Rehfield, and Wildors soils.  Cox soils are less than 20 inches deep.  Deerhorn and Wildors soils are moderately deep to a duripan.  McCarey, Molyneux, and Pedleford soils have average annual soil temperatures cooler than 47 degrees F.  Rehfield soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Cos, Deerhorn, McCarey, Pedleford, and Wildors soils occur on convex positions on basalt plains.  Molyneux and Rehfield soils occur in depression and drainageways on basalt plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is basin big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho.  This soil is of limited extent.
