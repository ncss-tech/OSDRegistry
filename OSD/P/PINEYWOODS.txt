(0 to 20 centimeters thick)

  Btg1--15 to 38 centimeters (6 to 15 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) iron-manganese masses; 2 percent blue quartz gravel; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary.

  Btg2--38 to 56 centimeters (15 to 22 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium angular blocky; firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; many coarse faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) iron-manganese masses; strongly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 38 to 89 centimeters)

(10 to 30 inches thick.)

  Cr--104 centimeters (41 inches); light gray (N 7/0) soft anorthosite that crushes to clay loam.

REMARKS: 
The June 2024 revision changed the location of this series to mesic MLRA 136 from MLRA 148.  This was due to boundary line changes in the new Ag. Handbook 296.  
The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (A and Eg horizons) 
Albic horizon--the zone from 2.5 to 15 centimeters (1 to 6 inches) (Eg horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 56 centimeters (6 to 22 inches) (Btg horizon)
