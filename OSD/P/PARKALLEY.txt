PARKALLEY SERIES

The Parkalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from rhyolitic tuff with a loess influence.  They are on mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Parkalley gravelly loam - on a slope of 9 percent in rangeland at an elevation of 1,963 meters.  (When described on August 4, 1982 the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 10 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; slightly hard, friable, non sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular and irregular pores; 20 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

 A2--10 to 23 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

 A3--23 to 48 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 19 to 50 cm)

 Bt--48 to 71 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very flaggy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 25 percent angular gravel and 30 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 80 cm thick)

 BC--71 to 104 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely flaggy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 35 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 35 cm thick)

 C--104 to 157 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely flaggy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine irregular pores; 25 percent angular gravel and 60 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0).
