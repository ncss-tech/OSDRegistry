PINCONNING SERIES

The Pinconning series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits and outwash underlain by clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains, lake terraces, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over clayey, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, frigid Mollic Epiaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Pinconning loamy sand, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand; dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 Cg1--20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) loamy sand; weak coarse granular structure; very friable; many roots; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) thick]

 Cg2--36 to 76 cm (14 to 30 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron throughout; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [18 to 56 cm (7 to 22 inches) thick]

 2Cg3--76 to 114 cm (30 to 45 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay; weak fine angular blocky structure; very firm; few fine roots largely along ped faces; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) masses of oxidized iron throughout; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinconning soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits and outwash underlain by clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allendale, Au Gres, Brevort, Manistee, and Roscommon soils. The well drained Manistee and the somewhat poorly drained Allendale soils are in the same drainage sequence. The competing Brevort and Roscommon soils are common associates in some areas. The Au Gres soils are sandy throughout the profile and are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper part and moderately low or low in the lower part. Permeability is rapid in the upper part and slow or very slow in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Only a small part is under cultivation. Principal crops are small grains, corn, hay, and some vegetables. Most of the soil is in cut over woodland, permanent pasture, or is idle cropland. Native vegetation is chiefly black ash, aspen, black spruce, and northern white cedar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 92, 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, 96, and 98 in northern lower peninsula and the eastern upper peninsula of Michigan, northeastern New York, and northern Wisconsin. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Grand Traverse County, Michigan, 1963.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon (mollic intergrade): from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).
Lithologic discontinuity: at 76 cm (30 inches) (top of the 2Cg3 horizon).
Aquic conditions: dominant chroma of less than 2 within 75 cm (30 inches) and redoximorphic features present in all horizons below 20 cm (8 inches).

This pedon is from an older (pre-1963) soil survey, and therefore is not described to 152 cm (60 inches). All other areas mapped as Pinconning in Michigan would be recorrelated to the Wakeley Series (Aeric Epiaquents).
