MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Norfolk Area, Virginia; 1902.

REMARKS: Portsmouth series was formerly classified as fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Umbraquults. This revision changes the classification to fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and moves the type location from Virginia to North Carolina.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 12 inches (the Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 23 to a depth of 35 inches. (the Btg horizon)
Aquic moisture regime
Strongly contrasting particle-size class - below a depth of 38 inches.
