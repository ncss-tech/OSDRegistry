MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lexington County, South Carolina, 1972. 

REMARKS: Pelion soils have a Btx horizon that is 6 inches or more thick and has pedogenic firmness and brittleness and restricts roots into the matrix when soil moisture is at or near field capacity. Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 10 inches (A and E horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 5 to 10 inches (E horizon).
Argillic horizon-the zone from 10 to 39 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Fragic soil properties--the zone from 22 to 39 inches (Btx horizon)
