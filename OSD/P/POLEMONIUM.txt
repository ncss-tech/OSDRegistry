POLEMONIUM SERIES

The Polemonium series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium and eolian materials over residuum weathered from granitic rocks. The Polemonium soils are on mesas and tops of mountains of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 820 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic Typic Cryorthents

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Canisrocks soils. The Canisrocks soils formed in colluvium on steep mountain slopes and contain greater than 35 percent cobbles, stones, and boulders in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Polemonium soils are on summits of mesas and mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium and eolian materials over residuum weathered from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 3215 to 4410 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 625 to 1440 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -2 to 2 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Forgotten soils. The Forgotten soils are on drainageways on mountain slopes and mesas and are moderately well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is bottlebrush squirreltail, sky pilot, Pacific hulsea, Sierra mousetail, cushion buckwheat, and rosy buckwheat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
