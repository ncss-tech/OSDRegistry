PERWASO SERIES

The Perwaso series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Perwaso soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Perwaso silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium platy structure parting to strong very fine angular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    C1--8 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 46 cm)

    C2--30 to 64 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); clear smooth boundary.  (25 to 40 cm thick)

    C3--64 to 91 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); abrupt smooth boundary.  (23 to 33 cm thick)

    2C--91 to 157 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Joraibi series. Joraibi has Hues of 5YR or 7.5YR and is intermittently moist July through September..

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Perwaso soils are on alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Elevations are 1,130 to 1,280 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is cool, arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C.,and the frost-free season is 120 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Benin, Dedmount, Juva, Slaw and Umberland soils.  Benin, Dedmount and Umberland soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Juva soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and lack a discontinuity with contrasting particle sizes.  Slaw soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarse in the particle-size control section and lack a discontinuity with contrasting particle sizes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing, cropland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is black greasewood, Torry quailbush, seepweed, shadscale, rubber rabbitbrush, inland saltgrass and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwest Nevada. MLRA 27.
