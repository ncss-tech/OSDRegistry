PAULDING SERIES

The Paulding series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense clayey lacustrine material. These soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. They are on lake plains and till-floored lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, illitic, nonacid, mesic Typic Epiaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Paulding clay, on a nearly level area in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches); dark gray (N 4/) clay, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; weak coarse granular structure; firm; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bg1--15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches); gray (N 5/) clay; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine angular blocky; firm; many fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Bg2--23 to 56 cm (9 to 22 inches); gray (N 5/) clay; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; firm; common coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

 Bg3--56 to 76 cm (22 to 30 inches); gray (N 5/) clay; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse angular blocky; very firm; many fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 41 to 107 cm (16 to 42 inches).]

 BCg--76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) clay; weak very coarse prismatic structure in upper part and massive in lower part; very firm; many fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 51 cm (20 inches) thick]

 Cdg--122 to 160 cm (48 to 63 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) clay; massive; very firm; many coarse prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation; coarse light gray (10YR 7/2) calcareous spots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline. [0 to 46 cm (18 inches) thick]

 Cd--160 to 203 cm (63 to 80 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay; weakly laminated; firm; many medium prominent gray (N 5/) iron depletions; thin patchy gray calcium carbonate coatings on laminae; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Paulding County, Ohio; about 1 mile west and 1/2 mile north of Junction, in Auglaize Township; 75 feet east of road; SW 1/4, NW 1/4, of sec. 24, T. 3 N., R. 3 E. ; USGS Junction, Ohio topographic quadrangle: lat. 41 degrees 12 minutes 7.50 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 28 minutes 31.90 seconds W., NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Related soils are the Covington, Hoytville, Latty, Livingston, Panton, Toledo, and Wetzel series. Covington, Hoytville, Panton, and Wetzel soils have argillic horizons. Latty and Toledo soils have less than 60 percent clay throughout the sola, and in addition, Toledo soils have a dark surface layer. Livingston soils have a dark surface layer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Paulding soils are on broad level or nearly level parts of lake plains that have a linear or concave surface. Slope gradient commonly is less than 1 percent but ranges to 2 percent. The soils formed in very fine-textured, calcareous lacustrine material that has evidence of weak lamination. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F). Frost free days range from 150 to 230 days. Elevations range from 175 m to 230 m (574 to 756 feet).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Broughton and Roselms soils that are in a toposequence with Paulding soils, and the Defiance, Fulton, Hoytville, Latty, Nappanee, St. Clair, and Wabasha soils. Moderately well drained Broughton soils are on gently sloping to steep dissected areas adjacent to drainageways. Somewhat poorly drained Roselms soils are on slightly higher landscape positions or are on gently sloping or sloping areas adjacent to drainageways. Defiance and Wabasha soils are on nearby flood plains. Fulton soils contain less clay and are on slightly higher landscape positions. Hoytville and Latty soils are on similar landscape positions but contain less clay, and in addition, the Hoytville soils formed in till. Nappanee and St. Clair soils formed in till and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (6 inches) below the surface from January to April or  during periods of high rainfall. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low in the subsoil and very low in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The Paulding soils are largely cleared and cultivated or used for pasture. Principal crops are soybean, wheat, hay, and some corn. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern and central Ohio and southeastern Michigan; MLRAs 98, 99, and 111B. The type location is in MLRA 99. The series is of large extent, about 210,000 acres.
