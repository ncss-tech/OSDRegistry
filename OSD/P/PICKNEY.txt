TYPICAL PEDON:  Pickney loamy fine sand--forested. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     A1--0 to 10 inches; black (N 2/0) loamy fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common clean sand grains; many fine and medium roots; few fine pores; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary.

     Cg2--69 to 80 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sand; single grained; loose; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Berkeley County, South Carolina; 6.5 miles northwest of Huger; 0.5 miles from intersection of S-08-171 and FS-137 on FS-137; site is 200 feet west of road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 12 inches, November to May
Soil Reaction: extremely acid to moderately acid 

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

A horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 2.5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Some pedons have mucky analogs of these textures 

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand 
Redoximorphic features (if they occur)--iron masses in shade of red, yellow, or brown 

COMPETING SERIES:
Hosford soils-- toe slopes and lower side slopes of lower coastal plain uplands
Naconiche soils-have buried A horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal plain
Landform: depressions, drainageways, stream terraces, and flood plains
Geomorphic Component: dips, talfs, treads
Parent Material: marine or fluvial sediments
Elevation: 20 to 150 feet
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 59 to 70 degrees
Mean Annual Precipitation: 38 to 52 inches
Frost Free Period: 190 to 275 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Chipley soils-- are on higher elevations of the landscape and are better drained 
Echaw soils-- are on higher elevations of the landscape and are better drained 
Ocilla soils-- are on higher elevations of the landscape and are better drained 
Osier soils-- do not have an umbric epipedon 
Pamlico soils-- have 16 to 51 inches of organic matter
Paxville soils-- are on higher elevations of the landscape and are better drained 
Pelham soils-- are on higher elevations of the landscape and are better drained 
Rutlege soils-have an umbric epipedon less than 24 inches thick
Witherbee soils-- are on higher elevations of the landscape and are better drained 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage Class (Agricultural): very poorly drained
Internal Free Water Occurrence: very shallow, persistent. The water table occurs at depths of less than 10 inches below the soil surface for more than 8 months during most years.  During the drier seasons the water table may recede to a depth of 20 inches.
Index Surface Runoff: negligible
Permeability: rapid

USE AND VEGETATION:
  Major Uses: Most of the areas are in native vegetation 
  Dominant Vegetation: pond pine, baldcypress, sweetgum, water tupelo, black tupelo, water oak, ;and an undergrowth of waxmyrtle, fern, maiden cane, and large gallberry. Cleared and drained areas are used principally for growing lobolly pine and pasture grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
  Distribution: Georgia, Florida and South Carolina 
  Extent: moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Berkeley County, South Carolina; 1974.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 34 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)
Aquic features - chroma of 1 or less immediately beneath the umbric epipedon (Cg1 horizon)
