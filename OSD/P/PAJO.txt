PAJO SERIES

The Pajo series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 31 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Pajo fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, forested -- on a north-facing slope of 80 percent at 4,500 feet elevation. When described on October 26, 1998, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

   A--1 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 25 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 14 inches thick)

   AC--8 to 16 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) fine gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 25 percent fine gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

   2C--16 to 27 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) extremely gravelly coarse sand, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse irregular pores; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 24 inches thick)

   2R--27 inches; moderately fractured granodiorite.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Tripod series. Tripod soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pajo soils are on mountain slopes and canyon walls at elevations of 3,200 to 6,950 feet. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 36 inches. The average annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kosh, Packerjohn and Tripod soils. Kosh soils are on canyon walls and are shallow to bedrock. Packerjohn and Tripod soils are on mountain slopes and are very deep. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; very rapid runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Pajo soils are used mainly for timber production and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, mountain maple and mallow ninebark.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43B. Pajo soils are not extensive.
