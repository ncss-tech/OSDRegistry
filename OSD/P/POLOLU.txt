POLOLU SERIES


The Pololu series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from basalt. Pololu soils are on valley floors. Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 78 inches (2000 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F (23 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, isohyperthermic Typic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Pololu extremely stony very fine sandy loam, on a northeast facing 4 percent slope under a cover of trees at an elevation of 152 feet, (46 meters). When described on 7/10/2008, the soil was dry throughout. (All textures are apparent field textures. Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 5 inches (0 to 13 centimeters); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) extremely stony very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dry; strong medium granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, nonplastic; nonsmeary; many very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 percent rounded gravels, 25 percent rounded cobbles and 25 percent rounded stones; neutral, pH 6.7, pH meter 1:1 water; clear smooth boundary.

    A2--5 to 15 inches (13 to 38 centimeters); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) extremely cobbly very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dry; strong medium granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, nonplastic; nonsmeary; common very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 percent rounded gravels and 50 percent rounded cobbles; neutral, pH 6.8, pH meter 1:1 water; diffuse wavy boundary.

    C1--15 to 50 inches (38 to 127 centimeters); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) extremely cobbly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; nonsmeary; common medium roots and common very fine roots; many medium interstitial pores; 15 percent rounded gravels, 50 percent rounded cobbles and 15 percent rounded stones; neutral, pH 6.8, pH meter 1:1 water; abrupt smooth boundary.

    C2--50 to 77 inches (127 to 196 centimeters); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very fine sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1), dry; massive; firm, hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; nonsmeary; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent rounded gravels; neutral, pH 6.9, pH meter 1:1 water.

TYPE LOCATION:  Hawaii County, Hawaii. From Polulu lookout, in the North Kohala District, walk down the valley trail to the beach, then walk up valley floor in the direction of 225 degrees SW to an elevation of 46 meters (152 feet). Pedon is located 5 meters east of stream bed. 20 degrees, 11 minutes, 49 seconds North latitude and 155 degrees, 44 minutes, 15 seconds West longitude, Old Hawaiian - U.S.G.S Quad: Honokane.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches (152 centimeters).
The mean annual soil temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F (21 to 24 degrees C)
Rock fragments on the surface range from 35 to 70 percent and range in size from gravel to boulders.

The A horizon
Texture is very fine sandy loam or sandy loam.
Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and range in size from rounded gravel to stones.

The C horizon
Texture is loamy sand or very fine sand.
Rock fragments range from 10 to 65 percent and range in size from rounded gravel to stones.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pololu soils are in valley floors on the island of Hawaii. Slopes are 3 to 12 percent. These soils formed in alluvium  weathered from basalt. Elevation is 0 to 2,152 feet (0 to 656 meters). Mean annual precipitation is about 60 to 120 inches (1500 to 3000 millimeters). The mean annual temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F (21 to 24 degrees C).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hanalei soils. The Hanalei soils are silty clay loam in the surface and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; very rapid permeability. The soils are occasionally flooded for very brief periods.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife habitat. Vegetation consists of guava (Psidium guajava), kukui nut (Aleurites moluccana), and hao (Hibiscus).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The soils are inextensive and are mapped in MLRA: 164.
