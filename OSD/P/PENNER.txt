PENNER SERIES

The Penner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from calcareous shale and sandstone.  Penner soils are on stream terraces, valley floors, alluvial flats and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Penner loam, on a south facing, 2 percent slope in an irrigated field at an elevation of 1790 m.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    Ap1--0 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many medium roots; few coarse and many fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated, (24 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary.

    Ap2--10 to 23 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many medium roots; few coarse and fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated (23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary.

    C1--23 to 58 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few medium and many fine roots; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated (16 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--58 to 104 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine discontinuous pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated (13 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    C3--104 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard to hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are finely disseminated (15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); few very fine salt crystals; 11 percent exchangeable sodium; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
  
TYPE LOCATION: Emery County, Utah; about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) northwest of Orangeville on a stream terrace along Cottonwood Creek; located about 650 feet south and 100 feet west of the NE corner of sec. 24, T. 18 S., R. 7 E.; Castle Dale USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 14 minutes 52 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 4 minutes 36 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that peaks from July to October and falls evenly throughout the remainder of the year; typic aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
  Clay content:  8 to 18 percent
  Sand content:  less than 15 percent coarser than very      fine sand
  Rock fragment content:  0 to 5 percent gravel

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 6 or 7 dry; 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture:  loam, very fine sandy loam, silty clay loam 
Clay content:  6 to 35 percent
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 25 percent
EC (mmhos/cm): 0 to 16
SAR:  0 to 6
Reaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  6 or 7 dry; 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture:  loam, very fine sandy loam
Clay content:  8 to 18 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. Series in similar families include the Lillings and Nuffel soils, which are fine-silty and have an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic; and the Garbutt Penoyer, Smaug, Toano and Yipor series, which do not exhibit the fluventic feature.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from shale and sandstone
Landform:  valley floors, stream terraces, alluvial fans and alluvial flats
Slopes:  0 to 6 percent
Elevation:  1,190 to 2,020 meters
Mean annual temperature: 7 to 12 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 23 cm
Precipitation pattern:  About 1.3 cm each month with a slight increase in May to about 1.7 cm and a late summer and early fall increase from thunder showers in July, August, September and October with 1.9 to 3.0 cm per month. 
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Castledale, Farb, Ferron, Greybull, Killpack, Persayo and Ravola series.  Castledale soils are coarse-loamy and are in narrow drainageways and flood plains.  Farb soils are shallow over sandstone and are on adjacent structural benches.  Ferron soils are poorly drained and are in lower lying areas under redtop and other wet meadow grasses.  Greybull, Killpack and Persayo soils are shallow or moderately deep over shale are on adjacent shale hills.  Ravola soils are finesilty and are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderate permeability, rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of March to October.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated areas are used for pasture and for growing alfalfa, corn and small grains. The potential native plant community is shadscale, winterfat, fourwing saltbush, Indian ricegrass, bud sagebrush, globemallow, galleta, sand dropseed and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Utah; LRR D, MLRA 34B; moderate extent; about 5,300 hectares (13,000 acres) in Emery County.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery Area, Utah, Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand, and Sevier Counties soil survey area, Utah, 2011.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to23 cm.  (A horizons)
Other features:  Fluventic feature: having an irregular decrease in organic carbon from a depth of 25 cm to a depth of 235 cm; or 0.2 percent or more organic carbon of Holocene age at a depth of 125 cm below the mineral soil surface.
Some pedons exhibit few salt or gypsum crystals below 90 cm.
 The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample profile numbers 598 and 1431 with lab numbers U581897 to U581901 and U611754 to U611758 from Utah State University lab at Logan, Utah.
