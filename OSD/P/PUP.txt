PUP SERIES

The Pup series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium over gypseous eolian deposits. These nearly level soils are on broad drainageways and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pup soils are on broad drainageways and alluvial flats. Slope is 0 to 9 percent. These soils formed in clayey alluvium over gypseous eolian deposits. Elevation ranges from 4,070 to 4,330 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Malpais Spring (NM) and the Yesum(NM) series. Malpais Spring soils have gypsic mineralogy and have a water table within 20 inches. Yesum soils have gypsic mineralogy and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, desert seepweed and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin.  MLRA 42, Najul soils are of limited extent.
