PIKECITY SERIES

The Pikecity series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy and gravelly marine sediments of Cretaceous age. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping marine terraces in the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area, MLRA 135B. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Pikecity silt loam, 1 to 6 percent slopes, in forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	A--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in); dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine to coarse roots throughout; common fine and medium pores; few prominent patchy black (10YR 2/1) stains on faces of peds; 10 percent rounded sandstone gravel; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 

	BA--8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 in); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine to coarse roots throughout; common fine pores; 10 percent rounded sandstone gravel; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

	Bt4--122 to 203 cm (48 to 80 in); light gray (10YR 7/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), and dark yellowish brown (10YR3/6) cobbly clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common faint patchy red (2.5YR 4/6) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; about 35 percent by volume rounded sandstone gravel and about 15 percent subrounded sandstone cobbles; extremely acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Pike County, Arkansas; about 1.5 miles west of Narrows Dam. SE14, NE1/4, SW1/4 Section. 14, T.7 S., R.26 W.; NARROWS DAM USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 34 degrees, 8 minutes, 49 seconds North; Longitude: 93 degrees, 44 minutes, 49 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 183 cm (72 in). Depth to horizons containing more than 35 percent by volume gravel begin at a depth of 76 cm (30 in) or deeper. Depth to horizon(s) containing more than 40 percent clay begin at a depths of 76 cn (30 in) or deeper. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the A and BA horizons and strongly acid to extremely acid in the Bt and BC horizons. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the A, E, BE, and upper Bt horizons and 15 to 60 percent in the lower Bt horizons and BC horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pikecity soils are on marine terraces of the Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain, MLRA 135B. They formed in loamy and gravelly marine sediments. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1143 to1397 cm (45 to 55 in). Mean annual temperature ranges from 17 to 23 degrees C (63 degrees to 75 degrees F). Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nathan, Peanutrock and Tiak series. 
Nathan soils have a fine-loamy control section and have mixed mineralogy.
Peanutrock soils have a loamy-skeletal control section. 
Tiak soils have a fine control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Pikecity soils are well drained. Runoff is low to medium and permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for native pasture and woodland. The vegetation is primarily southern red oak, sweetgum, American sycamore, white oak, and loblolly pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Cretaceous Western Gulf Coastal Plain of southwest Arkansas and possibly southeast Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.
