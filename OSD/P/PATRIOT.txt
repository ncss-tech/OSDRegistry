PATRIOT SERIES

The Patriot series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in eolian sands over alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on interdunes and alluvial flats on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

Onite soils have the base of the argillic horizon within 20 inches of the surface.  Yucca soils have 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the Bk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Patriot soils are on interdunes and alluvial flats on basin floors.  They formed in eolian sands over alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 3,900 to 5,210 feet.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 70 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Copia, Elizario, Foxtrot, Hueco, Mcnew, and Nations soils. Copia soils do not have argillic horizons and are on sand sheets on the basin floor.
Elizario soils have calcic horizons at depths greater than 20 inches and are on slightly depressed alluvial flats of the basin floor.  Foxtrot, Hueco, and Nations soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on the basin floor.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is very low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is of the desert shrub type consisting of mesa dropseed, spike dropseed, sand dropseed, threeawns, sand sage, broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush, and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Trans-Pecos of Texas and southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42; small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 3 to 23 inches.  (Bt, Btk1, Btk2, and Btk3 horizons)

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 7 inches. (A, Bt, and Btk1 horizons, mixed to 7 inches)

Argillic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 28 inches.  (Bt, Btk1, Btk2, and Btk3 horizons)

Calcic horizon: The zone from 6 to 28 inches.  (Btk1, Btk2, and Btk3 horizons)

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
