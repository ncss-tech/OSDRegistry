PALODURO SERIES

The Paloduro series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvium and colluvium derived from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans or valley flats and moderately to strongly sloping valley sides.  Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm, and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Paloduro clay loam, on southeast-facing, convex, 8 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 1,080 meters (3,540 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; many wormcasts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (20 to 30 centimeters thick)

    Bw--30 to 81 cm (12 to 32 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; common fine roots; common fine pores; common wormcasts; less than 2 percent by volume of calcium carbonate as films and filaments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

    Bk1--81 to 183 cm (32 to 72 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; common fine pores; about 5 percent by volume of calcium carbonate as films, filaments, and finely disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary. (25 to 127 centimeters thick)

    Bk2--183 to 203 cm (72 to 80 in); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; few fine pores; about 4 percent by volume of calcium carbonate as films, filaments, and finely disseminated carbonates; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Zita series.  Similar soils include the Berda, Berthoud, Bippus, Mansic, Manson and Texroy series.
Zita series: have a calcic horizon within 100 cm of the soil surface.
Berda series: have an ochric epipedon. 
Berthoud series: have mean annual soil temperatures less than 15 degrees C. and do not have a mollic epipedon. 
Bippus series: have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick. 
Manson and Texroy series: have an argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous, loamy alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.
Landform: alluvial fan, valley flat, or valley side.
Slopes: Dominantly 0 to 5 percent but ranges to 12 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 15 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 559 mm (17 to 24 in).
Frost-free period: 180 to 220 days
Elevation: 670 to 1,143 meters (1,800 to 4,000 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 25 to 36.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Berda, Bippus, Manson, and Texroy soils and the Ady, Alibates, Mobeetie, Plemons, Potter, Tascosa, and Veal soils.
Ady, Alibates, Plemons soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a argillic horizon.
Berda soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Bippus soils: are on lower landscape positions.
Manson soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions.
Texroy soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions.
Mobeetie soils: are on similar landscape positions and have an ochric epipedon.
Potter and Tascosa soils: are on higher landscape positions and are loamy skeletal in the particle-size control section. 
Veal soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions and have carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderate permeability.  Surface runoff is very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 12 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are primarily used for livestock grazing but a few areas are farmed to grain sorghum, cotton, and wheat.  This site is dominated by short grasses with a significant mid grass component.  Major grass species are blue grama, buffalograss and sideoats grama.  Yucca is the major woody species with relatively few forbs present.  This soil has been correlated to the Hardland Slopes (R-077EY055TX) ecological site in MLRA-77E.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E in LRR H) of western Texas, northwestern Oklahoma, and eastern New Mexico.  This series is of moderate extent.
