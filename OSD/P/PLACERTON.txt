PLACERTON SERIES 

The Placerton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock. These soils are on ridges, divides and sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Placerton gravelly sandy clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability in the argillic horizon and moderately rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Placerton soils are primarily used for rangeland and hayland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, lupine, fringed sagewort, milkvetch, and big sagebrush.  Some areas have widely scattered ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, and common juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Placerton soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA 43B.
