POHLOD SERIES  

The Pohlod series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum from mixed igneous rock sources.  These soils occur on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Pohlod gravelly loam, in forest on a 20 percent slope at an elevation of 1560 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oi -- 0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 cm thick)

 A--4 to 16 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick) 

 Bt1--16 to 40 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) very gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few (10 percent) faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. 

 Bt2--40 to 61 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few (20 percent) faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt horizons - 20 to 80 cm)

 BC--61 to 73 cm light grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 40 cm thick)

 R--73 to 150 cm; hard igneous bedrock.
