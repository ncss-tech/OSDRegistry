PADDY SERIES

The Paddy series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from hard shale and argillite.  Paddy soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Paddy clay loam, forested (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed grass, twigs, needles, bark, and roots. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--1 to 4 inches; dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw1--4 to 10 inches; weak red (2.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw2--10 to 16 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine pores; 10 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    R--16 inches; thinly bedded hard red shale.
