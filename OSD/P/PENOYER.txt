PENOYER SERIES

The Penoyer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from limestone, volcanic rocks and lacustrine deposits. Penoyer soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, alluvial flats, flood plains, lake plains, basin floors, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Penoyer silt loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 A--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick) 

 C1--10 to 43 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine and medium vesicular pores, few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 50 cm thick) 

 C2--43 to 104 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine and medium vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (13 to 100 cm thick) 

 C3--104 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak thick platy structure that approaches massive in places; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; about 20 miles west of Caliente; 3.1 miles west of junction of Delamar road and U.S. Highway 93, and 0.2 mile north of U.S. Highway 93; about 700 feet south and 200 feet west of the northeast corner of section 7, T. 4 S., R. 64 E.; USGS Pahroc Spring SE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 37 minutes 12 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 50 minutes 36 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.6200000 latitude, -114.8433333 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C. 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 30 percent of the less than 2 mm fraction.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent. 

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR. 
Valve: 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist. 
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

C horizons
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR. 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist. 
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist. 
Structure: Subangular blocky, or massive. Platy structure occurs in subhorizons below 100 cm.
Consistence: Soft to hard, dry, very friable or friable, moist, slightly sticky to moderately sticky and slightly plastic to moderately plastic, wet. 
Texture: Silt loam, but strata of very fine sandy loam, loam or silty clay loam are in some pedons. 
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent to violently effervescent. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Garbutt, Smaug, Toano and Yipor series.

Garbutt soils have layers within 100 cm that contain 20 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the sand and silt fraction and have a Bk horizon. Smaug soils have platy structure in the particle-size control section and are not moist for 10 to 20 days from July to September due to convective storms. Toano soils have Bk horizons and are not moist for the 10 to 20 days during the summer. Yipor soils have soil temperatures of 8 to 11 degrees C., and are dry in the summer. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Penoyer soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, alluvial flats, flood plains, lake plains, basin floors and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent but are generally less than 1 percent. Elevations are 1,070 to 2,130 meters. Penoyer soils formed in silty alluvium derived from limestone, andesite, volcanic ash, basalt, tuff, sandstone and lacustrine deposits. The annual precipitation is 150 to 225 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degree C, and the frost-free season is 130 to 170 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Checkett, Geer, Pahroc, Seaman, and the Swasey soils. Checkett and Swasey soils have an argillic horizons. Pahroc soils have a duripan and a particle-size control section that have more than 35 percent rock fragments. Geer and Seaman soils have a particle-size control section that contains more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low and low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for livestock grazing. A few are irrigated and are used for growing alfalfa, small grain, potatoes and sugar beets. Dominant native plants are winterfat and some Indian ricegrass and galleta. Saltbush and greasewood are on saline or saline-alkali areas. Most of the surface area is bare. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada and southwestern Utah. The soil is of moderate extent. MLRA 29.
