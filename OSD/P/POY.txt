POY SERIES

The Poy series consists of very deep poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to sandy deposits.  They formed primarily in clayey water-laid deposits overlying sandy deposits on glacial lake basins and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Poy silty clay loam - on a slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 231 meters (758 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Bg2--31 to 41 cm (12 to 16 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay; strong very fine angular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; common fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 5/3) and many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [10 to 23 cm (4 to 9 inches) thick] 

   BC1--41 to 64 cm (16 to 25 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; firm; common fine roots; many medium faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many medium prominent grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. 

   BC2--64 to 86 cm (25 to 34 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay; moderate medium prismatic structure; firm; few fine roots; faces of prisms totally gleyed; few medium prominent olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many coarse prominent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) iron depletions in the matrix; violently effervescent in pink (5YR 7/3) lime segregations; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

   2C2--86 to 152 cm (34 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sand; single grain; loose; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. Related soils are the  Montgomery, Poygan, and Zittau series. Montgomery and Poygan soils do not have more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Zittau soils are Aquollic Hapludalfs. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Poy soils are on nearly level areas or in slight depressions of glacial lake basins and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in water-laid, primarily clayey deposits overlying sandy deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 813 mm (25 to 32 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Borth, Poygan, and Zittau soils.  The well drained and moderately well drained Borth soils and the somewhat poorly drained Zittau soils are in a drainage sequence with the Poy soils.  The Poygan soils are on similar topographic positions in the upland, but they do not have layers of sand at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the clayey deposit and high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the sandy deposit. Permeability is slow in the clayey deposit and rapid in the sandy deposit. In certain settings, these soils are subject to common and long duration flooding. These soil have an apparent seasonal high water table at or near the surface for long periods in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Where drained, these soils are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, oats, and hay.  Undrained areas are used for pastureland or woodland.  Native vegetation is marsh grasses with some trees such as white ash, swamp white oak, red maple, silver maple, and American elm. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 95A, 95B, 97, and 98 in east-central Wisconsin and southwestern Michigan.  These soils are of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  The typifying pedon location has been moved from Outagamie County to its present location to center the soil in its geographic range.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (Ap, BA); cambic horizon - 31 to 86 cm (12 to 34 inches) (Bg, BC1, and BC2); aquic feature redox features and saturation in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.
