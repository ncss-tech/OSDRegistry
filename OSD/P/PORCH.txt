PORCH SERIES

The Porch series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on backslopes and footslopes of mountain slopes. Porch soils formed in colluvium from metasedimentary rocks with a small amount volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.
