PODO SERIES

The Podo series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium, residuum and colluvium from sedimentary rocks. Podo soils occur on structural benches, ledges on escarpments, ridge tops, hills, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 3 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Podo gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel 5 percent cobbles and 2 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable; common fine and very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw1--6 to 12 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; common very fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine interstitial and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw2--12 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky; few very fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine and medium interstitial pores; few large faint brown root channels; 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    R--19 to 23 inches; calcareous sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Kane County, Utah; about 8 miles southwest of Cannonville; Ponderosa Canyon; southwest 1/4 of sec. 9, T. 38 S., R. 4 W; Bryce Point USGS Quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 30 minutes 40.68 seconds North and longitude 112 degrees 14 minutes 2.54 seconds West, NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: ustic regime, aridic ustic subclass
Mean annual soil temperature: 42 to 47 degrees F
Mean summer soil temperature: 59 to 64 degrees F
Depth to lithic contact: 8 to 20 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Rock fragment content: less than 35 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Effervescence: noneffervescent to strongly effervescent

Bw horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 8, dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, cobbly sandy loam to clay loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly loam, and channery loam.
Effervescence: slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Dough series.  Dough soils are not calcareous. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: slope alluvium, residuum and colluvium derived from calcareous sandstone, limestone, and sandy shale
Landform: structural benches, ledges on escarpments, ridge tops, hills, and mountain slopes
Elevation: 6,200 to 8,790 feet
Slope: 3 to 70 percent
Mean annual temperature: 38 to 45 degrees F
Mean summer temperature: 59 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches
Frost-free period: 70 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sheege and Shupert soils and the competing Rachert and Ruko soils. Shupert soils are deeper than 20 inches to a lithic contact. Sheege soils have a mollic epipedon and have a mean summer soil temperature at bedrock of less than 59 degrees F.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife and some limited use for rangeland. The potential vegetation is two-needle pinyon, Utah juniper, antelope bitterbrush, black sagebrush, Mountain Big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and needle and thread.  These soils are correlated to Upland Shallow Loam (Pinyon-Utah Juniper) 047XB326UT at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are in the south-central part of Utah. They are of small extent.  MLRAs 47, 48A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kane County (Paunsaugunt Area), Utah, 1969. The area of the type location is now named the Panguitch Area, Utah.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon: from 0 to 6 inches. (A1 and A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon: from 6 to 19 inches. (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Particle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 19 inches. (part of Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Lithic contact: 19 inches. (R layer)

The 9/2004 revision changes the classification from Loamy, mixed, calcareous, frigid Lithic Ustorthents. A cambic horizon is recognized. The precipitation range is narrowed from 12 to 20 inches and the moisture regime subclass is defined as aridic ustic.
