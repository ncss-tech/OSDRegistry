PATIO SERIES

The Patio series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from argillite, phyllite and schist. These soils are on south and east facing mountain slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Gravelly loam, rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; decaying leaves, twigs, etc., about 60 percent of surface covered.

    A1--3 to 26 cm, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) dry; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; 40 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 24 cm thick)

    A2--26 to 36 cm, dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly heavy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine and medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine, and few medium coarse roots; 40 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw--36 to 69 cm, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine pores; 55 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (25 to 61 cm thick)

    R--69 cm; fractured phyllite and argillite.

TYPE LOCATION: Weber County, Utah; about 805 meters south and 1610 meters west of Utaba Dam; and about 305 meters east and 150 meters north of SW corner of sec. 35, T.8N., R.IW.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to bedrock--50 to 100 cm
Base saturation--less than 75 percent in some part of the upper 75 cm or above the bedrock
Mean annual soil temperature--at a depth of 50 cm, 7 to 8 degrees C
Mean summer temperature--16 to 19 degrees C
Rock fragment content--20 to 40 percent in the A1 horizon and 55 to 70 percent in the B2 horizon, consisting of angular argillite, phyllite and schist pebbles, gravel, and cobbles

A horizons 
Hue--10YR or 7.5YR
Value--3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma--2 or 3 moist
Reaction--pH 6.1 to 7.3 
Thickness of horizon--20 to 35 cm

Bw horizon
Hue--7.5YR through 2.5Y
Value--5 or 6 dry
Chroma--3 or 4 dry and moist
Texture--loam or clay loam
Structure--weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky
Reaction--pH 5.1 to 6.0
Thickness of horizon--25 to 60 cm

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bradshaw, Family (t), Lamondi, Mud Springs and St. Marys series. Bradshaw, Mud Springs and St. Marys soils have more than 75 percent base saturation throughout the upper 75 cm. Emily soils have contrasting texture change to loamy sand at depth of about 50 cm and are more than 100 cm deep to bedrock.  Lamondi soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick and are more than 100 cm to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform--south and east facing mountain slopes
Elevation--1575 to 2125 meters
Slopes--40 to 60 percent
Parent Material--residuum and colluvium weathered from argillite, phyllite, and schist
Climate--moist subhumid
Mean annual precipitation--510 to 640 mm
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 7 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--13 to 17 degrees C
Frost-free period--80 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Patio soils are used for watershed, range and wildlife habitat. The present native vegetation is Gambel oak, mule-ears, bluebunch wheatgrass, slender wheatgrass, lupine and balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Patio soils are moderately extensive in northern California and northern Utah; MLRAs 22B and 47.

REMARKS: Converted to metric, updated formatting, and O horizons were updated to start at zero. Competing series section was not updated. 7/2022

Patio soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric soil moisture regime.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
