PARKCITY SERIES

The Parkcity series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from limestone, quartzite, and sandstone.  Parkcity soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Parkcity gravelly loam, aspen woodland on a northwest facing, convex, 47 percent slope in aspen woodland at an elevation of 7,800 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 19, 1975, the soil was dry throughout.

    The surface is covered by 25 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 5 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; few very fine pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary (2 to 8 inches thick).

    A2--5 to 19 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and common medium roots; many very fine pores; 20 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary (10 to 20 inches thick).

    Bw--19 to 36 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak and moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many very fine pores; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary (10 to 20 inches thick).

    C--36 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine pores; 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5).
