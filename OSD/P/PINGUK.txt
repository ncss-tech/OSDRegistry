COMPETING SERIES: These are the McKinley and Tisuk series. McKinley soils are moderately deep to weather bedrock. Tisuk soils do not have saturated horizons in the spring.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: swales on alluvial fans
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly alluvium
Elevation: 381 to 564 feet
Slope: 2 to 5 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 27 inches
Annual temperature: 23 to 25 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Agiapuk, Boldrin, and Nuluk soils. Agiapuk soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on alluvial fans. Boldrin soils are very poorly drained, shallow to moderately deep to permafrost, and occur on mountain footslopes and toeslopes. Nuluk soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on flood plains on alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is willow ericaceous shrub scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
