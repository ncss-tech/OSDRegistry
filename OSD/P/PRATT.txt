PRATT SERIES

The Pratt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits on dunes on paleoterraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains, MLRA 79. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 740 millimeters (29 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Lamellic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Pratt fine sand - on a north facing, convex, 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 547 meters (1,794 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) As described on September 28, 1993.

COMPETING SERIES: The Turon series is the only other series in this family. 
Turon soils have a buried soil greater than 102 centimeters (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandy eolian deposits 
Landform: dunes on paleo-terraces, also on terraces and in some places floodplains. 
Slopes: 0 to 15 percent 
Elevation: 228.6 to 670.6 meters (750 to 2200 feet) 
Mean annual air temperature: 57 to 64 degrees F (14 to 18 degrees C) 
Mean annual precipitation: 480 to 810 millimeters (19 to 32 inches)  
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 185 to 225 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Attica, Carbika, Naron, and Tivin series.
The finer textured Attica and Naron soils are finer textured and on slightly less undulating topography. 
Carbika soils are in depressions on paleoterraces in river valleys and are poorly drained. 
Tivin soils are on steeper slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: rapid 

USE AND VEGETATION: Gentler slopes are usually cultivated; grain sorghum is the principal crop with lesser acreage of wheat and alfalfa. Steeper slopes are mostly in native range. Native vegetation is dominated by sand bluestem, indiangrass, and little bluestem. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas, Land Resource Region H, Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range; MLRA 79, Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is of large extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

Keys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth edition, 2014

2/08/95: Update series for Oklahoma

1/2017 BKN Added slope range to intro. Added on a north facing, convex, 1 percent slope and at an elevation of 547 meters (1,794 feet) to typical pedon. Added clay and sand content to RIC. Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting. Removed Carway, Carwile, Hayes, Langdon, Shellabarger, Tivoli, Turon, and Warnut soils from geographically associated soils. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
