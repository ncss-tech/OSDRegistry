POSEY SERIES

The Posey series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping plains, playa slopes, and draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Amarillo, Arvana, Bovina (T), Mansker, Midessa, and Tulia soils and the Drake, Patricia, Potter, Sharvana, and Tokio soils. 
Amarillo, Arvana, Bovina, Mansker, Midessa, and Tulia soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Drake soils are on higher landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon. 
Patricia soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a calcic horizon between 150 and 203 cm (60 and 80 in). 
Potter soils are on lower landscape positions and have carbonatic mineralogy and a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. 
Sharvana soils are on similar landscape positions but have a petrocalcic horizon within 50 cm (20 in). 
Tokio soils are on slightly lower landscape positions, have a calcic horizon between 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in), and are noneffervescent in the upper argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 12 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Widely used for dryland and irrigated crop production. Principal crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax native vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the High Lime (R077CY026TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of west Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hale County, Texas; 1969. 

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series. 
Posey series was formerly included in the Mansker and Veal series. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (Ap horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Btk, Btkk, B'tk horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 46 to 99 cm. (18 to 39 in) (Btkk, B'tk horizons) 
Plugged (kk) horizon: 46 to 99 cm (18 to 39 in) (Btkk1, Btkk2) 

Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data available: S90NM-009-005 (Curry County, New Mexico); S2019TX305005, S2019TX305006 (Lynn County, Texas); S2019TX219007 (Hockley County, Texas).
