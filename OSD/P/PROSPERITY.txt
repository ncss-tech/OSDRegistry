Extent: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Newberry County, South Carolina, 2005.

REMARKS: Prosperity soils were previously included in mapping with Helena soils. Helena soils have a depth to soft bedrock of greater than 152 centimeters (60 inches). The August 1991 revision of Helena changed depth to bedrock from "more than 48 inches to more than 60 inches" to be consistent with one depth to bedrock class as shown on the Soil Interpretation Records. The slope range was changed to allow up to 25 percent slopes (8/2007). The February 2026 revision updated the format.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 (0 to 6 inches) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 89 centimeters (6 to 35 inches) (Bt and BCt horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization samples have been submitted to the National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, Nebraska. (S99SC-071-005-01-06).
