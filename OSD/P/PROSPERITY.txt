MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Newberry County, South Carolina, 2005. 

REMARKS: Prosperity soils were previously included in mapping with Helena soils. Helena soils have a depth to paralithic contact of greater than 60 inches. The August 1991 revision of Helena changed depth to bedrock from "more than 48 inches to more than 60 inches" to be consistent with one depth to bedrock class as shown on the Soil Interpretation Records. The slope ramge was changed to allow up to 25 percent slopes (8/2007). 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 35 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization samples have been submitted to the National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, Nebraska. (S99SC-071-005-01-06).
