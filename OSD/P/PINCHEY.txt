PINCHEY SERIES

The Pinchey series consists of moderately deep over duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess, volcanic ash, and alluvium. Pinchey soils are on pediments and fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vitritorrandic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Pinchey ashy silt loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partly covered by 2 percent gravel.

(Combined thickness for A horizons is 25 to 40 cm)

Combined thickness for Bt2 and Bt3 is 20 to 35 cm

 Bqm1--75 to 90 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 4/3); cemented material; massive; rigid; very strongly cemented by secondary silica; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear, gradual boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick) 

 Bqm2--90 cm; cemented material; massive; very rigid; indurated by secondary silica; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Malheur County, Oregon; approximately 10 miles south of Jordan Valley, Oregon; UTM 487075 easting, UTM 4734911 northing, zone 11 NAD83 on the USGS Juniper Ridge 7.5 minute quadrangle, latitude 42 degrees 45 minutes 59.8 seconds north and longitude 117 degrees 9 minutes 28.14 seconds west, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is dry throughout in summer and fall and moist in winter and spring; the soil surface is wet in April due to snowmelt; Aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.

Bkqm horizons - 
Duripan cementation: very strongly cemented to indurated.
Other features: the upper part of the duripan is a 1 to 3 mm opal cap.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Babala series. The Babala series is moderately deep to a duripan over basalt or tuff bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Pinchey soils are on pediments and fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium, loess, and ash. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,430 to 1,585 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Salheur soils. Salheur soils are shallow to a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, very slow permeability, and low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush and Idaho fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Oregon; the soil is of small extent. MLRA 25.
