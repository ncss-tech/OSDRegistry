PAIT SERIES

The Pait series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff.  Pait soils are on fan remnants, lake terraces, and strath terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about  230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cheviot, Hencratt, Redcliff, Schwalbe, and Whichman series.

Cheviot soils average 20 to 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section.    Hencratt soils are influenced by volcanic glass and are deep to paralithic contacts.  Redcliff and Schwalbe soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Whichman soils are deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Pait soils are on fan remnants, lake terraces, and strath terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt and tuff.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Icene, Mesman, and Riddleranch soils.  Icene soils are fine-loamy, have salic horizons, and occur on lake terraces.  Mesman soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons, and have  electrical conductivities greater than 16.  Riddleranch soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts and have a frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pait soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  A few areas are used for irrigated hay and pasture.  The native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Cambic horizon - The zone from 20 to 61 cm (Bw horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (2C1 horizon and parts of the Bw and 3C2 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data from Oregon State University determined less than 1 percent organic matter in the Bw horizon of the typical pedon.
