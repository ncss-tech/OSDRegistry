PEP SERIES

The Pep series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian sediments in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and side slopes above playas and along draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 Degrees C (61 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Calciustolls

Portales, Estacado and Zita soils: are on similar or slightly lower landscape positions. 
Acuff soils: are on similar landscape positions and have an argillic horizon. 
Olton, Pantex, and Pullman soils: are on similar landscape positions, have an argillic horizon, and average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Widely used for dryland and irrigated crop production. 
Principal crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax native vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the Limey Upland (R077CY028TX) range site in MLRA-77. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of west Texas and eastern New Mexico. This series is extensive.

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included with the Portales and Zita series. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (A horizon) 
Cambic horizon: 25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 in). (Bw horizon) 
Secondary calcium carbonate: 41 to 81 cm (16 to 32 in). (Bk horizon) 
Calcic horizon: 81 to 203 cm (32 to 80 in). (Bkk horizon) 
Plugged (kk) horizon: 81 to 203 cm (32 to 80 in). (Bkk horizon) 
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macro porosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.
