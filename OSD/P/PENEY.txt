PENEY SERIES

The Peney series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone.  Peney soils are on summits of hills and have slopes of 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Peney channery loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; 20 percent limestone channers; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bk1--3 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; few large calcium carbonate accumulations, slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk2--7 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; many large calcium carbonate accumulations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick)

    2R--10 inches; limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico; 2.4 miles south and 2.9 miles west of junction of NM Highway 115 and U.S. Highway 84; 2,000 feet east and 100 feet south of the NW corner of Sec. 31, T. 26N., R. 4 E.  106 degrees, 33 minutes, 51 seconds west longitude; 36 degrees, 27 minutes, 02 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section December through April and July through September.

Soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.

Depth to lithic contact:  10 to 20 inches

Reaction:  slightly to moderately alkaline

Calcium carbonate:  Exceeds 5 percent by volume as accumulations, concretions or pendants.


Percent clay in the control section:  18 to 35 percent clay

Coarse fragments by volume (profile):  0 to 15 percent channers

Percent fine sand or coarser:  more than 15 percent


A horizon:  Value - 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist 

Chroma:  3 or 4 


Bk horizon:  Value - 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist 

Chroma:  2 through 4 

Texture:  clay loam, loam, or silt loam

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Kopie(AZ) series.  Kopie soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the B horizons and receive less total precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Peney soils are on summits of hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  Elevations are 7,100 to 7,800 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from limestone.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 100 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lindrith, Calendar, and Ransect soils.  All of these soils are more than 20 inches to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Peney soils are used for fuelwood and wood products.  The natural vegetation is pinyon, Rocky Mountain juniper and pinyon ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern New Mexico.  Series is of small extent.
