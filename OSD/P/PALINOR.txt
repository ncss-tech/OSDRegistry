PALINOR SERIES

The Palinor series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and dolomite.  Palinor soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplodurids

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ursine series. Ursine soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C, are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between mid-July and mid-September, and have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Palinor soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,494 to 2,317 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Parisa, Shabliss, and Urmafot soils. Parisa soils are moderately deep and have Bkq horizons above the duripan. Shabliss soils are loamy and have mixed mineralogy. Urmafot soils have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Palinor soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, spiny hopsage, and Nevada ephedra.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada. These soils are extensive with about 596,000 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 28B.
