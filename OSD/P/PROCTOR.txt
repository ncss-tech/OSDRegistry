PROCTOR SERIES 

The Proctor series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains, stream terraces, kames, and eskers. They formed in loess and in the underlying stratified loamy outwash. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

Tecumseh soils are deeper than 165 cm (65 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Waupecan soils average more than 75 percent sand and more than 15 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Proctor soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, kames and eskers of Wisconsinan Age. These soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying stratified loamy outwash. Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 800 to 1067 mm (31 to 42 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 148 to 300 meters (486 to 984 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brenton, Drummer, Lawson, and Sawmill soils. The somewhat poorly drained Brenton soils and the poorly drained Drummer soils form a drainage sequence with Proctor soils and are on lower parts of the landscape. Lawson and Sawmill soils have a mollic epipedon more than 61 cm (24 inches) thick and are on nearby flood plains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per seconds). Permeability is moderate.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cultivated crops. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Illinois and Indiana. Extent is large in MLRAs 95B, 108A, 108B, 110, 111D, 115A, and 115C. About 105,000 acres have been correlated. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ford County, Illinois, 1929. 

REMARKS: Rarely flooded, sandy substratum, and till substratum phases were recognized during the SDJR process. These soils and associated landforms will be investigated during MLRA update activities. These soils could potentially be re-correlated to a new series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
 mollic epipedon-the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (Ap and A horizons); 
argillic horizon-the zone from approximately 28 to 117 cm (11 to 46 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons); a 
lithologic discontinuity from loess to outwash at a depth of 71 cm (28 inches).
