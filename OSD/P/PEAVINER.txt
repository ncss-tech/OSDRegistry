PEAVINER SERIES

The Peaviner series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain meadows and basins of mountain valley floors. Peaviner soils are formed in colluvium with an influence of volcanic ash overlying residuum of andesitic tuff and tuff breccia.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Peaviner gravelly ashy sandy clay loam - moist mountain meadows, on a 4 percent southfacing slope at an elevation of 5,927 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Andic soil materials are apparent field textures.)

  A--0 to 11 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) gravelly ashy sandy clay loam; brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and coarse, and common fine and medium roots throughout; few fine irregular and few fine and very fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 2 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. 

  ABt--11 to 20 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) gravelly sandy clay loam; brown (7.5YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common faint clay films on ped faces; few very fine and medium, and common fine roots throughout; few fine irregular and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.7); abrupt wavy boundary.

  Bt--20 to 38 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly clay; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) dry; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many prominent clay films on ped faces; few very fine and fine roots throughout; few very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 14 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 28 inches thick)

  BCt--38 to 49 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly clay; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common distinct clay films on ped faces; few very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 14 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt wavy boundary.
