PATHEAD SERIES

The Pathead series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on benches and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 20 to 80 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Pathead extremely stony loam, rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely stony loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine pores; 5 percent angular gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 40 percent stones, and 5 percent boulders; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated, (13 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; 20 percent angular gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated, (10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 21 inches thick)

    Bk--14 to 26 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine roots; few very fine pores; 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common thin coatings on lower sides of rock fragments, (12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 26 inches thick)

    R--26 inches; sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Calaveras, Kadygulch, Kingspoint, Mowbray, Repkie, Specie, Wilde, and Wilspring series.
Calaveras, Kadygulch, Kingspoint, Mowbray, and Specie:  do not have a lithic contact within 60 inches of the mineral surface.

Wilde:  has reaction more acid than pH 7.4.

Wilspring:  have soil moisture control sections that are affected by peak precipitation during the spring.
