COMPETING SERIES: There are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: peat plateaus on mountains
Parent material: mossy organic material and/or woody organic material
Elevation: 381 to 846 feet
Slope: 0 to 12 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 29 inches
Annual temperature: 23 to 25 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Boldrin, Cassiterite, Kiglauik soils. Boldrin soils are very poorly drained, shallow to moderately deep, and occur on mountain toeslopes and footslopes. Cassiterite soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on flood plains and flood plains on mountains. Kiglauik soils are somewhat poorly drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high above the permafrost and very low in the in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is shrub birch/sedge scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hill-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
