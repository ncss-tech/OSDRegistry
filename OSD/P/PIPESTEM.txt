TYPE LOCATION: Raleigh County, West Virginia; about 3.4 miles by road east-south east of the junction of Glade Creek Road and WV Route 41; USGS Prince, West Virginia topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 49 minutes 54.3 seconds N and longitude 81 degrees 2 minutes 58.3 seconds W, NAD 83. Elevation: 1360 feet.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the top of the Cambic: 3 to 23 cm (1 to 9 inches)
Depth to the base of the Cambic: 83 to 200 cm (33 to 79 inches)
Solum Thickness: 83 to 200 cm (33 to 79 inches)
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 152 cm (60 inches)
Rock Fragment content: 5 to 35 percent, by volume, in the A horizon; 5 to 60 percent in subhorizons of the B horizon; 15 to 75 percent in the C horizon, where present.  Rock fragments consist of a mixture of channers, gravels, flagstones, and stones of siltstone, shale, fine-grained sandstone, and occasionally limestone. The volume and size of the rock fragments generally increases with depth.
Soil Reaction: Strongly acid to neutral.

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
A or Ap horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 2.5 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--silt loam or silty clay loam

Bw horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  The clay content in the B horizon ranges from 25 to 45 percent. The weighted average in the control section is more than 35 percent.

C horizon (if it occurs):
Colors and textures similar to the B horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no other members in this taxonomic family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Hills and mountains
Landform: Hillslope, mountain slope, and cove
Hillslope Profile Position: Backslope and footslope

In West Virginia, this includes members of the Mauch Chunk and possibly the Greenbrier series geologic formations. The surface of the soil is often covered with stones and boulders from the Pennsylvanian-age Pottsville Formation.

Frost-free period: 140 to 180 days
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 9 to 13 degrees C. (48 to 55 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Cateache soils--are formed in residuum and are less than 152 cm deep

Extent: Moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Raleigh County, West Virginia, 2008.

REMARKS: Pipestem soils were previously mapped as members of the Shouns, Jefferson, and Meckesville series. Data from pedons sampled in MLRA 127 indicate a need to establish a series to reflect the genesis of these soils found on landforms of Mauch Chunk lithology.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 30 cm (A and BA horizons)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 11 to 160 cm (BA, Bw, and BC horizons)
Base saturation--this pedon has a base saturation of 100 percent (by NH4OAC) at a depth of 30 cm.
Free carbonates--There are no free carbonates within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface.
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 200 cm

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data from the NSSL is available for this pedon. Lab Pedon Number: 04N0121. NASIS User Pedon ID: S03WV081001. Other reference pedons available from the NSSL: 04N0124, 04N0132, 04N0128, 04N0129.
