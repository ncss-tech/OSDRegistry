PANTAK SERIES

The Pantak series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in mixed slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from igneous rock. Pantak soils are on pediments, hills and mountains with slopes of 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches (356 cm). The mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F (17 degrees C). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Pantak very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 
 A--0 to 1 inch (0 to 3 cm); brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 3 inches or 3 to 8 cm thick)
 AB--1 to 4 inches (3 to 10 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick 5 to 13 cm)
 Bt--4 to 14 inches (10 to 36 cm); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct continuous clay films on rock fragments; 50 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 16 inches or 10 to 41 cm thick)
 R--14 inches (36 cm); andesite.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Barten (I)(AZ) series. The Barten series is inactive. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Pantak soils are on pediments, hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 5 to 60 percent. They formed in mixed slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from andesite and related igneous rock. Elevation ranges from 2,500 to 5,600 feet (762 to 1,707 meters). The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 67 degrees F (13.9 to 19.4 degrees C). The frost-free period is about 170 to 250 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lampshire, Romero, Chiricahua, and Oracle soils. Lampshire, and Romero soils do not have argillic horizons. Chiricahua soils are clayey. Oracle soils are loamy. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Pantak soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes sideoats grama, cane bluestem, curly mesquite, Schott agave, prickly pear, snakeweed, and mesquite. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern and Central Arizona and West Texas. This series is of moderate extent. MLRA 38, 41, and 42.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (0 to 10 cm)(A horizon) 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 4 to 14 inches (10 to 36 cm) (Bt horizon)
