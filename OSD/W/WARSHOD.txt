WARSHOD SERIES

The Warshod series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and conglomerate. These soils are on terrace sideslopes, hillsides, and mountainsides. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Warshod gravelly loam, rangeland - on a north facing concave slope of 50 percent at an elevation of 6,600 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(7 to 12 inches thick)

    Cr--46 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) weathered conglomerate, crushing to loamy fine sand, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; strongly effervescent.
