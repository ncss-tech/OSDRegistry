WARNEKE SERIES

The Warneke series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium or colluvium weathered from limestone.  These soils are on hills, escarpments, ridges, mountains, and bedrock-floored plains.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Warneke gravelly loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk--4 to 15 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very channery loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine and very fine pores; 25 percent channers; 15 percent flagstones; disseminated lime; continuous distinct lime casts on underside of fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 18 inches thick)

    R--15 inches; limestone, with few fractures.

COMPETING SERIES:  

Pensore (MT) - have an ustic soil moisture regime that borders on aridic

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - hills, escarpments, ridges, mountains and bedrock-floored plains.
Elevation - 2,600 to 6,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 70 percent.
Parent material - residuum, slope alluvium or colluvium weathered from limestone.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 25 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 105 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Warneke soils are used mainly for range and woodland.  Potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, prairie sandreed, western yarrow, Oregon-grape, black sagebrush, and juniper with low density stands of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and limber pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Warneke soils are of moderate extent mainly in the mountains in central Montana.  MLRAs 43B, and 46.
