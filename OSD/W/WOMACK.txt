WOMACK SERIES



The Womack series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately

slowly permeable soils that are formed in mixed alluvium with some

loess influence.  They are on coalesced fan terraces and fan

pediments.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual

precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is

about 46 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Argidurids



TYPICAL PEDON:  Womack gravelly silt loam, rangeland, on a 5 percent

north slope, 5900 feet elevation.  When described on July 9, 1984 the

unless otherwise noted.)

fine and very fine granular; soft and very friable; common very fine

the surface covered with pebbles; 15 percent pebbles in the horizon;

common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few

thin clay films on faces of peds and line pores; 5 percent cobbles, 35

percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4);

abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)



    2Bk1--13 to 17 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly

sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard and

very friable; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine

tubular pores; 3 percent cobbles, 50 percent pebbles; violently

effervescent (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately

alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 11 inches thick)



    2Bk2--17 to 24 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely

gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard and

very friable; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5

percent cobbles, 60 percent pebbles; violently effervescent (28 percent

calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy

boundary.  (6 to 17 inches thick)



    2Bk3--24 to 31 inches; multicolored stratified sand and gravel;

extremely gravelly coarse sand; single-grained; loose and loose; few

very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent

cobbles, 60 percent pebbles, 15 to 20 percent pebbles less then 3/8

inches in diameter; small pockets of loamy, strongly effervescent

material like the above horizon; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt

wavy boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)



    3Bqkm--31 inches; lime-silica indurated pan; extremely hard and

extremely firm; pan contains more than 80 percent rock fragments;

violently effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series listed in the same family.  A

similar soil is the Gunnel series.  Gunnel soils lack an argillic

horizon and are shallow to a duripan.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Womack soils are on nearly level to sloping

coalesced fan terraces and fan pediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 8

percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 5,700 feet.  The soil formed

in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  The average annual

precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, the average annual air

temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F, the frost free season is 95 to

120 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darkbull, Gunnel(T),

Kancan(T) and Nibbs(T) series.  These soils are on coalesced fan

terraces and fan pediments.  Darkbull, Kancan and Nibbs soils are very

deep and lack a duripan.  Darkbull and Nibbs soils lack an argillic

horizon.  Kancan soils have a mollic epipedon.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Medium runoff.  Moderately

slowly permeable above the duripan and very slow through the pan.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Womack soils are used for range and wildlife

habitat.  The native vegetation is low sagebrush, black sagebrush,

bluebunch wheatgrass and Sandberg bluegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho.  The soils of this

series are not extensive.
