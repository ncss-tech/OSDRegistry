MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Marion County, South Carolina; 1949. 

REMARKS: 
The concept of these soils is having a dominant chroma 2 in all layers, except a subsurface or upper subsoil layer with a dominant chroma of 3 or more. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 11 inches (A and E horizons) 
Albic horizon--the zone from 7 to 11 inches (E horizon) 
Argillic horizon--the zone from 11 to 68 inches (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and BCtg horizons) 
Endosaturation--saturation in all layers to a depth of 80 inches
