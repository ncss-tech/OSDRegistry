WILDE SERIES 

The Wilde series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium and local colluvium from hard brown shale or argillite.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges, and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wilde very channery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very channery loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent flagstone and 30 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bw1--5 to 21 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent flagstones and 60 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual irregular boundary. 

    Bw2--21 to 34 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent flagstones and 65 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 16 to 35 inches). 

    R--34 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) hard fractured shale.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wilde soils are primarily used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.   Native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, Sandberg bluegrass, western yarrow, big sagebrush and common juniper.  Areas with forest canopy cover have an overstory of Douglas-fir and limber pine and an understory of Rocky Mountain juniper, big sagebrush, Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Wilde soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1589.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric horizon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A and Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 5 to 34 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 34 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); lithic contact to hard, fractured shale bedrock at 34 inches (R horizon).  Wilde soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
