WANGS SERIES

The Wangs series consists of shallow to paralithic contact with shale, well drained soils that formed in 15 to 50 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying shale.  These soils are on side slopes on dissected, bedrock-controlled uplands. Slope ranges from 6 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, illitic, mesic Entic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Wangs silty clay loam, on an east-facing, linear slope of 10 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 325 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 28 centimeters; very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; firm; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 30 centimeters thick) 

 2BC--28 to 41 centimeters; olive (5Y 4/3), olive gray (5Y 4/2) and dark greenish gray (10Y 4/1) clay; weak medium and coarse angular blocky structure; firm; about 2 percent limestone channers and flags; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 35 centimeters thick) 

 2Cr--41 to 152 centimeters; greenish gray (5GY 5/1) and dark greenish gray (10Y 4/1) clay shale; common coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles; weak very thick platy inherited rock structure; very firm; about 5 percent limestone channers and flags; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: No other series are in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--15 to 50 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying shale
Landform--side slopes on dissected, bedrock-controlled uplands
Slope--6 to 35 percent
Elevation--305 to 335 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--6 to 10 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--735 to 965 millimeters
Frost-free period--145 to 205 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Colo, Emeline, Kenyon and Wagen Prairie soils.
Colo--are at lower landscape positions in flat to concave drainageways and are frequently saturated at the surface of the soil during the wettest periods in normal years
Emiline--are on higher landscape positions on side slopes and shoulder slopes and have a lithic contact with limestone within a depth of 25 centimeters
Kenyon--are on higher landscape positions on upper side slopes and summits and do not have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 200 centimeters
Wagen Prairie--are on similar landscape positions and have a paralithic contact with shale within depths of 50 to 100 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--well drained--a frequently saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second in the silty or loamy sediments and 0.01 to 1.00 micrometrs per second in the shale
Surface runoff potential--medium or high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are small grains and hay. Some areas are pastured. Native vegetation is mixed big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass and other grasses of the tall grass prairie, or oak savanna. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic sections--Dissected till plains and Wisconsin driftless section
MLRAs--Eastern Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies (104) and Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills
LRR M; southeast Minnesota 
Extent--small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Goodhue County, Minnesota, 2007. Series named after the village of Wangs in Goodhue County, Minnesota.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 41 centimeters (Ap and 2BC horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 66 centimeters (Ap, 2BC, and 2Cr horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (Ap horizon);
paralithic contact--the contact with the 2Cr horizon at a depth of 41 centimeters;
lithologic discontinuity--at the upper boundary of the 2BC horizon;
udic moisture regime. 

The thin mantle (Ap, A, Bw and Bk horizons) can be of eolian, till, colluvial or residual origin.

Color in the 2BC horizon, which formed in shale, is due partially to the color of parent material and not considered related to contemporary saturation.

The paralithic contact is Decorah Shale. Commonly there are isolated or thin beds of channers and flags of limestone in the shale matrix.
