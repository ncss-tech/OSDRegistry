WHEELERWELL SERIES


The Wheelerwell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from quartzite and some dolomite. Wheelerwell soils are on backslopes of hills. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Wheelerwell very gravelly sandy loam, forest and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 75 percent gravel, 5 cobbles and 3 percent stones with 40 percent of the area covered by approximately 1 to 4 centimeters of duff.

	Btk--18 to 27 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very gravelly clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine through coarse roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; 90 percent, distinct, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay films on all faces of peds and on rock fragments; 5 percent, prominent, white(10YR 8/1), calcium carbonate coats on bottom of dolomite rock fragments; 30 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); very abrupt wavy boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bt and Btk horizons is 16 to 30 inches) 

	R--27 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) hard dolomite, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; very slightly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Golondrina, Irock, Jumbopeak, Lantis, Majada, Mokiak, Montoso, Murdo, Nederland, Purcella, Romine, Salas, Wandurn, and Willowman series. Golondrina, Lantis, Majada, Murdo, Nederland, Purcella, Romine, and Willowman soils are very deep. Irock and Wandurn soils are deep to bedrock. Jumbopeak soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 58 degrees Fahrenheit and 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Montoso soils have cinders 12 to 32 inches deep. Salas soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and have an ustic moisture regime. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wheelerwell soils are on backslopes of hills. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from quartzite and some dolomite. Elevations are 5,700 to 8,690 feet. The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and occasional summer thundershowers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches; mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Buckspring, Fletcherpeak and Wheelerpass soils. Buckspring soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock, calcareous and formed on limestone hills and mountains. Fletcherpeak soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock, calcareous and formed at higher elevations on limestone hills and mountains. Wheelerpass soils have a frigid soil temperature regime, are less than 20 inches to bedrock and located at higher elevations. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for forest and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, curlleaf mountainmahogany, Gambels oak, yellowleaf silktassel and bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Nevada, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
