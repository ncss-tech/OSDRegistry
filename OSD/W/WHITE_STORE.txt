SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: North Carolina, Virginia, and possibly South Carolina
Extent: Moderately extensive

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anson County, North Carolina; 1915.

REMARKS: The type location description was modified based on field examination and transect data collected 5/91.  The 9/2025 revision reformatted the description.  No data was changed.  The 9/2025 description moved the type location from Durham County, North Carolina back to Anson County, North Carolina.  The site in Durham County is now covered by an industrial park.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: the zone from 13 to 107 centimeters (5 to 42 inches) (Btss horizons).
Slickensides-presence of slickensides in the zone from 13 to 107 centimeters (5 to 42 inches (Btss1 and Btss2 horizons)
Vertic feature: cracks within 127 centimeters (50 inches) of the soil surface that are 5 mm or more wide through a thickness of 30 centimeters (12 inches) or more for some time in normal years, and slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates in a layer 15 centimeters (6 inches) or more thick that has its upper boundary within 127 centimeters (50 inches) of the soil surface; or a linear extensibility of 6 centimeters (2.5 inches) or more between the surface and either a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) or a paralithic contact, whichever is shallower
Oxyaquic feature: Saturation with water in one or more layers within 102 centimeters (40 inches) of the surface in normal years for either or both 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days.
