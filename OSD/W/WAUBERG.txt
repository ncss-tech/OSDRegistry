WAUBERG SERIES

The Wauberg series consists of poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick beds of loamy marine sediments within large prairie areas and low areas within the flatwoods of central and southern Florida.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, hyperthermic Arenic Albaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wauberg sand, in a nearly level large prairie area. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap1--0 to 5 inches; black (10YR 2/1) sand; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; medium acid; clear smooth boundary.

     Ap2--5 to 9 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sand; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A1 or Ap horizon is 5 to 9 inches.)

     A21--9 to 19 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

     A22--19 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sand; common medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), few fine distinct dark gray, and few medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) mottles, color is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) when mixed; weak fine granular structure; very friable; very few fine roots; medium acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A2 horizon is 15 to 32 inches.)

     B21tg--24 to 40 inches; dark gray (N 4/0) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; very few fine roots; few fine and medium nodules of limestone; weak discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (14 to 22 inches thick)

     B22tg--40 to 50 inches; dark gray (N 4/0) sandy clay loam; few fine distinct yellowish red mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; very few fine roots; few fine nodules of limestone; moderate medium pockets and streaks of gray (10YR 5/1) sandy loam; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

     B3g--50 to 63 inches; gray (N 5/0) sandy clay loam, common medium faint dark gray (N 4/0), common medium faint gray (10YR 5/1), and common fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) mottles; massive; firm, strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

     Cg--63 to 81 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) clay; common medium faint gray (10YR 5/1) and few medium faint light gray (10YR 7/1) mottles, massive; firm; few fine soft and firm nodules of limestone; medium acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Alachua County, Florida; in Paynes Prairie about 0.2 mile south of Florida Department of Recreation and Parks, District 3 Headquarters, and 2.4 miles east of U.S. Highway 441, NW1/4SW1/4 sec. 22 T. 10 S., R. 20 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 50 to 75 inches thick. Soil reaction ranges from very strongly to slightly acid in the A horizon and strongly acid to neutral in the Bt and Cg horizons.

Texture of the A horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is 5 to 9 inches thick.  Where
thickness is only 5 or 6 inches, the color when mixed with A2 horizon to a depth of 7 to 9 inches is very dark gray.  The A2 horizon has hue of N, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 or less, with or without mottles of yellow and brown. It is 15 to 32 inches thick.

The B21tg horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 1 or less, with or without mottles in various shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is sandy clay loam, with clay content ranging from 24 to 35 percent.  The B22tg horizon has the same color range as the B21tg horizon.  Texture is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam with clay content of 18 to 35 percent.  The B3g horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or less, with mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is the same as the B22tg horizon.  Thin streaks and pockets of finer and coarser textured material occur in this horizon in some pedons.

The Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or less, with yellow, brown, and red mottles.  Texture is sandy clay or clay and contains thin streaks and pockets of sandy loam and sandy clay loam materials in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Closely similar soils are the Blichton, Eaton, and Floridana series.  Blichton soils have less than 35 percent base saturation
and more than 5 percent plinthite in the argillic horizon.  Eaton soils have finer textured argillic horizons.  Floridana soils have mollic epipedons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wauberg soils occur in wet prairies and low areas within the broad flatwoods of central and southern Florida.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in thick beds of loamy textured marine sediments.  Average annual precipitation near the type location is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Eaton and Floridana series and Emeralda, Felda, Kaliga, Monteocha, and Wauchula series.  Emeralda soils have finer textured argillic horizons.  Felda soils have thinner dark colored epipedons. Kaliga soils are very poorly drained and are of organic origin.  Monteocha soils are very poorly drained, and both Monteocha and Wauchula soils have spodic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Slow runoff.  Permeability is rapid in the A horizons and very slow in the upper Btg horizon.  The water table is at depths of less than 10 inches
for 3 to 5 months during most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of these soils remain in native vegetation consisting of low panicums, bushybeard, creeping and chalky bluestems, bulrush, cutgrass, maidencane, carpetgrass, dogfennel, briars, thistle, and waxmyrtle.  A few areas are wooded with slash and longleaf pine, sweetgum, and red maple.  The areas are mostly used for wildlife, some are used for rangeland or
pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and southern Florida.  The series is of moderate extent.
