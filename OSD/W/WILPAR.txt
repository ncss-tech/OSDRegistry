Mean annual soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - 59 to 61 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 10 to 15 inches, includes the Bt1 horizon.

Depth to base of argillic horizon - 52 to 60 inches.

Depth to bedrock - 52 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered volcanic rocks such as rhyodacitic tuff.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 50 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 50 to 60 percent, mainly pebbles.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as rhyodacitic tuff.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birchcreek, Derringer, Droem (T), Erakatak, Leevan, McIvey, Ravenswood, Roostercomb, Sharesnout, Swanpeak (T), Threek, Tickville (T), Urwil, Yago, and Yeates Hollow series.

Birchcreek, Droem, Leevan, Ravenswood, Roostercomb, Sharesnout, and Tickville soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Derringer and Erakatak soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  McIvey, Swanpeak, Threek, Urwil, and Yago soils are very deep.  Yeates Hollow soils are deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wilpar soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed mainly in residuum, with minor amounts of colluvium, weathered from rhyodacitic tuff.  Rock outcrops occur in complex with these soils.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,800 to 7,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with most of it coming as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 43 degrees F. and the frost-free period is about 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hamtah, Homestake, Tica, Udel, Winu, and Winz soils.  Hamtah soils have thick mollic epipedons.  Homestake soils are very deep, have weakly silica and carbonate cemented horizons, and have frigid temperature regime.  Tica soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Udel soils are very shallow to lithic contacts and do not have argillic horizons.  Winu soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have thick mollic epipedons.  Winz soils are very deep and have ochric epipedons and albic horizons above argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wilpar soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat, but provide some livestock grazing.  The vegetation is a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon with a sparse understory of mountain big sagebrush and associated grasses and forbs.  Some Utah juniper, curlleaf mountainmahogany, and serviceberry are also present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 5,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 29.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lincoln County (Meadow Valley Area), Nevada, 1971.

REMARKS:  This revision of March 2001 updates the taxonomic class from Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Argic Cryoborolls.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 inches (A1, 2A2, and 2Bt1 horizons).

Argillic horizon - The zone from 5 to 58 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons).

Paralithic contact - The boundary at 58 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (2Crt layer).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 25 inches (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons and part of the 2Bt3 horizon).
