WOODHALL SERIES

The Woodhall series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from igneous and sedimentary rock. These soils are on mountain slopes, dip slopes, structural benches, hills and landslides. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 585 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Woodhall stony loam - mixed grass and timber. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine granular and crumb structure; soft, very friable, slightly plastic; 20 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine granular; hard, friable, slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along in some root channels; 40 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 51 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds, on surfaces along root channels and on surfaces of many rock fragments; 50 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 74 cm thick)

    BC--51 to 61 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely stony loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly plastic; 60 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 36 cm thick)

    R--61 cm; rhyolite.
