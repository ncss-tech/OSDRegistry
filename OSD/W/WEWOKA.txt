WEWOKA SERIES

The Wewoka series consists of soils moderately deep, excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils which formed from weathered chert conglomerate.  These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on prairie uplands in the Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A).  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, siliceous, thermic Udic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wewoka gravelly sandy loam--forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; 25 percent by volume of rounded chert pebbles 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter and 3 percent rounded chert cobbles 3 to 10 inches in diameter; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

      E--5 to 17 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly loamy sand, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; 40 percent by volume of rounded chert pebbles 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter and 2 percent rounded chert cobbles 3 to 10 inches in diameter; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 17 inches thick)

      B--17 to 22 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) extremely gravelly loamy sand, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, loose; 60 percent by volume of rounded chert pebbles 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter and 2 percent rounded chert cobbles 3 to 10 inches in diameter; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)

      Cr--22 to 40 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/8) cherty conglomerate, yellowish red (5YR 5/8) moist; conglomerate can be crushed with moderate to strong hand pressure; moderate excavation difficulty; fractures in the conglomerate are 1/2 to 1 inches wide and 6 to 12 inches apart; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Seminole County, Oklahoma; about 6 miles south and 7 miles west of Wewoka; 1200 feet east and 600 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 18, T. 7 N., R. 7 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact with conglomerate is 20 to 40 inches. The reaction of all horizons ranges from very strongly acid through neutral.

The A horizon is brown (10YR 5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  It is a sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Rounded chert pebbles, 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter range from 10 to 45 percent by volume and cobbles from 3 to 10 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.

The E horizon is pink (7.5YR 7/4), light brown (7.5YR 6/4, 6/3), brown (7.5YR 5/3), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6).  It is gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand.  Rounded chert pebbles 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter range from 20 to 75 percent by volume and cobbles from 3 to 10 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent by volume.

The B horizon is reddish yellow (5YR 7/6), reddish brown (5YR 5/4), pink (7.5YR 7/4), or light brown (7.5YR 6/4).   It is very gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand.   Rounded chert pebbles, 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter range from 50 to 80 percent by volume and cobbles from 3 to 10 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 5 percent.

 The hardness of the Cr horizon ranges from chert conglomerate that can be crushed with moderate pressure of the hand to material that can barely be chipped with the spade.  Color of the fine particles in the slightly weathered conglomerate is reddish yellow (5YR 6/8), yellowish red (5YR 5/6), or reddish brown (5YR 5/4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wewoka soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep hills within the Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A).  They occur on broad to narrow ridges.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from a chert conglomerate.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F. Average annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 38 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 58 to 62. Elevation is 900 to 1100 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darnell, Niotaze and Stephenville series.  Darnell soils have sola less than 20 inches thick and loamy control sections.  Niotaze soils have clayey control sections.   Stephenville soils have fine-loamy control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; runoff is negligible to low; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for grazing livestock or as a source of gravel for roads.  Vegetation consists of scrub oak forest with an understory of grasses.  Blackjack oak, post oak, and hickory are the main trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Oklahoma.  The series is inextensive.
