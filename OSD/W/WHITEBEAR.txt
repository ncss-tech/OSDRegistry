WHITEBEAR SERIES 

The Whitebear series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake terraces, flood plains and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in mixed lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whitebear soils are lake terraces, flood plains and alluvial fans in mountain valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in mixed lacustrine sediments. Elevations range from 3,100 to 3,600 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 21 inches, and the average frost-free period is from 70 to 100 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dahlake (T), Meadowpeak, McLangor, and Barzee series. Dahlake soils are on lake terraces and are fine-silty. Meadowpeak, McLangor, and Barzee soils are on floodplains and closed depressions. Meadowpeak soils do not have argillic horizons. McLangor soils have a histic epipedon. Barzee soils consist of organic materials.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained, moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly Alkali cordgrass, Alkali sacaton, Nuttall's alkaligrass, Inland saltgrass, Alkali bluegrass, and Fowl bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Montana.  This soil is not extensive.  MLRA 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Flathead County, Montana, 2003. Whitebear is a coined name.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (E, E/Btn horizons)
Natric horizon - the zone from 13 to 18 inches (Btn horizon)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 13 to 18 inches (Btn horizon)

Whitebear soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
