COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cave, Goodsprings, Irongold, Simona, and Vace series. All these series lack a silica cemented laminar cap on top of the petrocalcic horizon. Cave (MLRA 40, 41, and 42) soils have a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in both the A and B horizons, and receive summer monsoonal precipitation. Goodsprings (MLRA 30) soils have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bk and Bkm horizons and do not have an indurated petrocalcic horizon. Irongold (MLRA 30) soils are on limestone alluvium on fan remnants. Simona (MLRA 42, 77C, and 77D) soils are on upland plains, mesa tops, and low ridges, have hues of 5YR to 10YR throughout, and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Vace (MLRA 30) soils formed from calcareous loess and mixed alluvium and are on fan remnants and ballenas. Goodsprings, Irongold, and Vace soils (MLRA 30) are in the Mojave Desert with frost free seasons of as low as 180 days and are usually moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Welport soils are on shoulders of hillslopes at elevations of 231 to 687 meters (755 to 2,250 feet). The Welport soils formed in uplifted alluvium derived from calcareous sandstone and/or shale. Slope is 5 to 15 percent . The mean annual precipitation is 152 to 203 mm (6 to 8 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C. (60 to 64 degrees F.). The frost free season is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cochora, Elkhills, Hillbrick, Kimberlina, and Pyxo soils. Cochora soils formed in sedimentary residuum on linear backslopes of hillslopes and have a paralithic contact within 50cm. Elkhills soils are on linear backslopes of hillslopes and formed in very deep alluvium. Hillbrick soils have a lithic contact within 50 cm and formed in sandstone and shale residuum on hillslopes. Kimberlina soils are on alluvial fans and formed in very deep alluvium. Pyxo soils formed in sandstone and shale residuum on linear backslopes of hillslopes and have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazing, wildlife habitat, and oil production. The vegetation is mainly fillaree and annual grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Signal Hills, Temblor Range, and Telephone Hills along the border of Kern and San Luis Obispo Counties (MLRA 15). This soil is not extensive.
