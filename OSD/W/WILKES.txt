WILKES SERIES

The Wilkes series consists of shallow, well drained soils with moderately slow to slow permeability. They formed in residuum weathered from intermediate and mafic crystalline rocks on uplands in the Piedmont. Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 45 inches. Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic, shallow Typic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Wilkes sandy loam--wooded. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

Oi--3 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed mixed hardwood and pine forest litter.

Oe--1 to 0 inch; moderately decomposed forest litter.

A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sandy loam; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine and medium quartz pebbles; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick) 

E--3 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandy loam; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine strong brown fragments of weathered rocks; common fine and medium pebbles; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick) 

Bt--6 to 10 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay; common fine prominent black, green, and faint strong brown bodies, all of which are assumed to be partially weathered primary minerals; weak coarse angular blocky structure; firm, sticky, plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; few medium pebbles; A horizon material in old root channels; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick) 

Bt/C--10 to 13 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm, sticky, plastic; common faint clay films on faces of peds(Bt part); common fine prominent black and few fine distinct gray bodies and common thin green bands of partially weathered primary minerals; relic platy structure (C part); common hard schist fragments; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick.) 

Cr--13 to 48 inches; soft, yellowish brown, green, black, and gray saprolite which crushes to loam; relic platy rock structure; firm; few fine roots in upper part; few large roots in rock fractures; few distinct clay films line vertical cracks; common fine and medium schist fragments; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (24 to 42 inches thick) 

R--48 inches; hard schist bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Durham County, North Carolina; from Durham-Wake County line, 1/2 mile west on N.C. 98, 3.9 miles southeast on SR 1805 and 1901, 100 feet west of road in wooded area. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to weathered bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Depth to hard rock is 40 to more than 60 inches. Rock fragments of gravel, cobble, and stone size range from 0 to 50 percent in the A horizons and 0 to 35 percent in the B horizon. Dark concretions range from none to common. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the upper horizons and from moderately acid through mildly alkaline in the lower horizon. Clay content averages 18 to 35 percent for the combined A, Bt, and C horizons. 

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. The A and E horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. The A horizon in eroded phases is sandy clay loam or clay loam. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles, bodies, or streaks of black, greenish, grayish, or whitish saprolite or primary minerals are few to common in most pedons. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction. Thin transitional horizons are present in most pedons. 

The BC or CB horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. Mottles, bodies, or streaks of black, greenish, grayish, or whitish saprolite or primary minerals are none to common. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.

The C horizon, where present, is loamy saprolite of intermediate or mafic crystalline rock. It is black, greenish, brownish, or grayish in color. 

The Cr layer is soft, weathered intermediate or mafic crystalline rock that can be dug with difficulty with a spade.

The R layer (where present) is hard unweathered to slightly weathered intermediate or mafic crystalline rock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in related families include the Goldston, Louisa, Louisburg, Montevallo, and Poindexter series. Goldston and Montevallo soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Louisa soils have cyclic pedons and contain more mica throughout the sola. Louisburg soils lack continuous Bt horizons. Poindexter soils have a paralithic contact at depths of more than 20 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wilkes soils are on gently sloping narrow ridges and sloping to steep side of ridges between intermittent and permanent streams in the southern Piedmont. Slopes are generally between 10 and 25 percent and range from 4 to 60 percent. The soil formed in residuum weathered from diorite, hornblende, schist, and related rocks that are moderately high in ferromagnesian minerals or from a mixture of felsic and mafic rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 60 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 65 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coronaca, Crawfordville (T), Cullen, Enon, Gaston, Iredell, Mecklenburg, Mocksville, Pittsboro, Poindexter, Sedgefield, Virgilina, Winnsboro, and Wynott series. These soils are all deeper to bedrock than Wilkes soils. Coronaca, Cullen, Enon, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Mocksville, Poindexter, and Wynott soils are well drained and in similar landscape positions Crawfordville(T), Iredell, Pittsboro, Sedgefield, and Virgilina soils have redoximorphic features due to wetness, are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained, and are in flats, depressions, and foot slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately slow to slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: About 80 percent of the soil is in trees and pasture. The dominant trees are shortleaf, loblolly, and Virginia pines, eastern red cedar, blackjack oak, and post oak. About 20 percent is cultivated to crops such as small grain, lespedeza, corn, and tobacco. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, and Virginia. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon--the zone between depths of 6 and 10 inches (Bt horizon) 
Paralithic contact--the upper boundary of the Cr horizon at a depth of 13 inches
