WELD SERIES

The Weld series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick calcareous loess, or from silty uniform alluvium or outwash.  Weld soils are on hills, uplands, or smooth plains and interfluves and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.
