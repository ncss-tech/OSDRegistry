WRIGHTSVILLE SERIES

The Wrightsville series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in old silty and clayey alluvium. These soils are on level to depressional areas on old stream terraces. Slopes are less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: soil formed in old silty and clayey alluvium
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: soils are on level to depressional areas on old stream terraces
Slope: less than one percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 16 to 18 degrees C (60 to 65 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 112 to cm (44 to 52 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Acadia (LA), Elysian (OK), Foley (AR), Lafe (AR), McKamie (LA), and Muskogee (AR) series. 
Acadia soils: are somewhat poorly drained, on slightly higher stream terraces, do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 51 cm (20 in), and do not have a depleted matrix within the upper 13 cm (5 in) of the argillic horizon.
Elysian soils: are moderately well drained, have less clay in the control section, and are on circular mounds on terraces. 
Foley soils: have a natric horizon and are on lower sideslope positions on terraces.
Lafe soils: have a natric horizon and are on lower sideslope positions on terraces.
McKamie soils: are well drained, on higher terraces, do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 51 cm (20 in), and do not have a depleted matrix within the upper 13 cm (5 in) of the argillic horizon.
Muskogee soils: are moderately well drained, on higher terraces, do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 51 cm (20 in), and do not have a depleted matrix within the upper 13 cm (5 in) of the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Wrightsville soils are poorly drained. Runoff is slow and permeability is very slow. The soil is wet in the layers below a depth of 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) and above the Btg horizon during December through April in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are in forest or pasture. Some areas are used for rice, soybeans, and cotton. Native trees are sweetgum, water oak, and willow oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Coastal Plains of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas; MLRA 133B; The series is of large extent with about 500,000 acres.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pulaski County, Arkansas; 1922.

REMARKS: The series was updated in 2004 to allow clay loam texture in the Btg horizon, and for clay texture to continue into the lower parts of the Btg horizon. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 in) (A, Eg1 & Eg2 horizons).

Albic horizon: 3 to 43 cm (1 to 17 in) (Eg1 & Eg2 horizons).

Glossic horizon: 43 to 58 cm (17 to 23 in) (Btg & Eg horizon)

Argillic horizon: 43 to 183 cm (17 to 72 in) (Btg & Eg, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 horizons)
