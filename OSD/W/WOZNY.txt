WOZNY SERIES 

The Wozny series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils which are deep to a densic contact.  These soils formed in loess or silty alluvium over loamy alluvium underlain by dense sandy or loamy lodgement till on disintegration moraines. Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle, moderately slow in the loamy alluvium and slow in the dense till. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Wozny muck, on a plane, slope of 1 percent, in a wooded swamp, at an elevation of about 1,245 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

TYPE LOCATION: Washburn County, Wisconsin; about 32 miles northeast of Spooner; 2,050 feet east and 2,100 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 33, T. 42 N., R. 10 W;  USGS Stanberry West topographic quadrangle; lat. 46 degrees, 04 minutes, 35 seconds N., and long. 91 degrees, 37 minutes, 36 seconds W.; NAD 27.
 
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of sand coarser than very fine averages 15 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy alluvium, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium, and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly in the silty mantle and in the loamy alluvium, and from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations occur in all layers above the densic contact. Aquic conditions occur within 12 inches at some time in normal years.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Formed in loess or silty alluvium over loamy alluvium underlain by dense sandy or loamy lodgement till.
Landform: Disintegration moraines.
Slope: 0 to 2 percent.
Elevation: 1000 to 1500 feet.
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches.
Frost-free days: 110 to 135 days.

 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beaverbay, Frogcreek, Parkfalls, Stanberry, and Stinnett soils. The moderately well drained Beaverbay and Stanbery soil and the somewhat poorly drained Parkfalls soils are on more sloping landscape positions. The moderately well drained Frogcreek soils and the somewhat poorly drained Stinnett soils form a hydrosequence with Wozny soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to medium. Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle, moderately slow in the loamy alluvium, and slow in the dense till. Wozny soils have seasonal saturation perched above the densic contact at a depth of 1 foot above the surface to 0.5 foot below the surface for a long duration at some time during the period September to June in normal years.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Common trees are cedar, tamarack, spruce, ash, maple, balsam, aspen, birch, hemlock, and elm. Where the forest cover has been removed, vegetation is mostly grasses and sedges with some shrubs, such as alder and willow.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Wisconsin. LRR K and MLRA 90A. The series is of small extent.
