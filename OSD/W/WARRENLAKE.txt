SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Harris County, Texas, 2019.

REMARKS:  
The series was formerly included in the Gessner series.  The series was separated based on taxonomy. Gessner soils do not have a natric horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 29 to 79 cm (11 to 31 in) (Btnz, Btnzy1, and Btnzy2 horizon)

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 29 cm (0 to 11 in.  (A1 and A2 horizons)

Natric horizon: 29 to 203 cm (11 to 80 in) (Btnz, Btnzy1, Btnzy2, Btnzy3, and Btnyg horizons)

Aquic conditions: 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in) (Btnz, Btnzy1
