WOLFTEVER SERIES

The Wolftever series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in fine or moderately fine textured alluvium. The soil is on low stream and river terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Aquic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Wolftever silty clay loam - cultivated. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 7 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; few fine black (10YR 2/1) manganese concretions; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 15 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on the faces of peds; few fine black (10YR 2/1) manganese concretions; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.)

    Bt2--15 to 22 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; firm; common distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; few fine black (10YR 2/1) manganese concretions and stains; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

    Bt5--42 to 53 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; few fine black (10YR 2/1) manganese concretions; common black (10YR 2/1) manganese stains; many fine and medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; many fine and medium strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron accumulations as soft masses; few fine flakes of mica; few gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (Thickness of the Bt horizon ranges from 22 to 50 inches)

  C1--53 to 65 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; massive; firm; common fine black (10YR 2/1) manganese concretions; many medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; common medium yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron accumulations as soft masses; few fine flakes of mica; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

  C2--65 to 89 inches; 34 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), 33 percent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), and 33 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam; massive; friable; common fine and medium black (10YR 2/1) and dark brown (10YR 3/3) manganese and iron concretions; common fine flakes of mica; strongly acid. (Thickness of the C horizon ranges from 5 to 40 inches).

TYPE LOCATION: Hardin County, Tennessee; on low terrace of Tennessee River, 4 miles southwest of Savannah on Diamond Island road and 1/2 miles west of Mud Creek, on C. S. Roberts' farm.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Water rounded gravel are less than 5 percent in the A and upper Bt horizons and range from 0 to 15 percent in the lower Bt and C horizons. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except the surface layer where limed. Black and dark brown iron and manganese concretions range from none to common in each horizon.

The Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic depletions with value of 4 or more and chroma 2 or less are within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, but not within the upper 10 inches. Redoximorphic features range from few to common in shades of brown, red, black, or  gray Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.

The Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral. Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, red, or black. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.

The BC, C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1  to 4, or is neutral. Redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray and some pedons are an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color. Texture is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and allows sub-horizons of silty clay or clay.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Annemaine, Beason, Cid, Creedmore Dogue, Gritney, Helena, and Lignum series. Annemaine soils have redder hue in the Bt horizon. Beason soils have redox depletions in chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Cid soils have paralithic contact within 40 inches. Creedmore soils have sandy clay loam upper B horizons and clay lower B horizons that have a COLE of .09 or more. Dogue soils have less than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Gritney soils typically are redder in the lower sola and have less than 30 percent silt in the control section. Helena and Lignum soils are on Piedmont uplands and formed in saprolite of metmorphic origin. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wolftever soils are on low stream and river terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. These soils formed in moderately-fine and fine textured alluvium. Near the type location the average annual temperature is 60.5 F. and average annual precipitation is 56.9 inches near the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The competing Beason series and the Dowellton, Egam, Etowah, Busseltown, Gumdale, and Staser series. Dowellton soils are poorly drained. Egam and Staser soils, which are on flood plains, have thick dark A horizons and lack argillic horizons. Etowah soils are well drained and have a fine-loamy control section. Busseltown and Gumdale soils are fine-loamy and have a fragipan in the subsoil..

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; low to high runoff; moderately slow permeability. Lower areas are subject to flooding during periods of high rainfall in winter and early spring

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is used for cropland but some is used for pasture. The native vegetation was forest of oaks, hickory, beech, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Appalachian Ridge and Valley, Highland Rim and Southern Coastal Plain MLRAs of Tennessee, northwest Georgia, and northern Alabama. The series is of moderate extent.
