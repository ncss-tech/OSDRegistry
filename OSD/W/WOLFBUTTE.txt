WOLFBUTTE SERIES

The Wolfbutte series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rock and tephra.  They are on alluvial fans and stream terraces in valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wolfbutte soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces in valleys. Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,400 feet. The soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rock and tephra.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches. The average annual temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Choptie, Crume, and Lobert soils. Choptie soils are on adjacent plateaus.  They are 12 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Crume soils are on stream terraces. They are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Lobert soils are on adjacent stream terraces. They have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are more than 60 inches deep.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability above the duripan. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland, irrigated and non-irrigated pastureland and hayland. The soils commonly support mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, squirreltail, and scattered ponderosa pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Basins in south-central Oregon, MLRA 21. The series is of small extent.
