WISHBONE SERIES

The Wishbone series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terrace escarpments.  They formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Lamellic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wishbone silt loam, forested; on a south-facing slope of 55 percent at 2,000 feet elevation.  When described on August 24, 1972, the soil was dry.  Pedon was redescribed on May 16, 1994.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    0i--0 to 1 inch; needles, twigs, and grass.  (0.5 to 1 inch thick)

    0e--1 to 2 inches; partly decomposed needles, twigs and grass mixed with light gray Mt. St. Helens volcanic ash.  (0.5 to 1 inch thick)

    A--2 to 7 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine to coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; many very fine and fine black concretions; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--7 to 20 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate thin platy and weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine to coarse roots; many very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; many wavy lamellae 1/16 to 2 inches thick occupy 20 to 40 percent of the horizon; common very fine and fine black concretions; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 inches thick)

    Btk--20 to 60 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) silt loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common wavy lamellae 1/16 to 2 inches thick occupy 10 to 20 percent of the horizon; few very fine black concretions; violently effervescent (calcium carbonate); few faint lime veins and splotches between lamellae; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wishbone soils are on terrace escarpments.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  They formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,700 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches and the average annual air temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Artnoc, Caboose and Crash soils.  Artnoc soils are on terrace escarpments and do not have a Btk horizon and have a frigid temperature regime.  Caboose and Crash soils are on terrace escarpments and have very fine sandy loam surface textures and a frigid temperature regime.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, and ponderosa pine, with an understory of common snowberry, baldhip rose, Saskatoon serviceberry, white spirea, bluebunch wheatgrass, low Oregongrape, silky lupine, pine reedgrass, and strawberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana and northeastern Washington.  The series is not extensive.
