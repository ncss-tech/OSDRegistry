WISDOM SERIES 

The Wisdom series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on outwash plains, alluvial fans, fan remnants and stream terraces. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Wisdom silt loam, in irrigated grass hay (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed matted roots; abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    A1--2 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--7 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 horizons - 7 to 15 inches)

    Bw--14 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations (due to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation); weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 25 inches thick)

    2C--27 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 45 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Beaverhead County, Montana; approximately 900 feet north and 50 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 9, T. 4S, R. 15W; Fox Gulch topographic quadrangle; Latitude 45 degrees 29 minutes 52 seconds N. and Longitude 113 degrees 27 minutes 58 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature - 35 to 40 degrees F., cryic temperature regime.
Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 15 inches
Depth to lithologic discontinuity - 15 to 40 inches

Note: Some pedons may have a thin C horizon immediately above the 2C horizon.  Also, some pedons may have mixed alluvium and glacial flour below 30 inches

A1, A2 horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 3; dry or moist
Texture: loam or silt loam
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent--0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles
Reaction: pH 6.5 to 7.3 

Bw horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y; dry or moist
Value: 5 to 7 dry; 3 to 6 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4; dry or moist 
Texture: loam or silt loam 
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to 30 percent--0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles
Reaction: pH 6.5 to 7.3

2C horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y; dry or moist
Value: 6 or 7 dry; 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4; dry or moist
Texture: loamy sand, sand or coarse sand
Clay content: 0 to 10 percent
Rock Fragments: 35 to 75 percent--30 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobbles
Reaction: pH 6.6 to 7.3

COMPETING SERIES: 
Turson (WY) - do not have a cambic horizon
Truaxcreek (MT) - have secondary calcium carbonate accumulation

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - outwash plains, alluvial fans, fan remnants and stream terraces
Elevation - 5,900 to 7,400 feet
Slope - 0 to 4 percent
Parent material - alluvium derived from mixed sources 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Shewag and Mooseflat soils.  The Shewag soils are sandy-skeletal and are on similar landform positions. The Mooseflat soils are very poorly drained and on floodplains or drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate over very rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Wisdom soils are used for irrigated grass hay and irrigated pasture.  The vegetation is mainly Garrison creeping foxtail, meadow foxtail, timothy, tufted hairgrass, and other miscellaneous sedges, rushes and forbs.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Wisdom soils are not extensive in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA - 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Beaverhead County, Montana, Big Hole Valley Area, 2005.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 2 to 14 inches (A1, A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon - from 14 to 27 inches (Bw horizon)
Redox concentrations - from 14 to 27 inches (Bw horizon)
Lithologic discontinuity - at 27 inches (2C horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 12 to 42 inches (part of A2, Bw, part of 2C horizons)

Wisdom soils have a cryic temperature regime, an ustic moisture regime, and an oxyaquic moisture subclass. 

Additional Information: Oxyaquic condition is due to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation.
