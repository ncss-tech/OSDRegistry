WOODHURST SERIES

The Woodhurst series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from nonacid igneous rocks. These soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 8 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Woodhurst stony loam, in native grass (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear boundary. (8 to 19 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 20 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very stony clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine blocky structure that parts to very fine granular;; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many fine tubular pores; continuous distinct clay films on vertical faces and patchy clay films on horizontal faces with organically stained glossy films on weathered rock fragments; 50 percent rock fragments and weathered igneous rock fragments that crush easily in the hand; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt2--20 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely stony clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; distinct continuous clay films on all faces of peds; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); 80 percent rock fragments; clear wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

    R--26 inches; light colored hard quartz monzonite porphyry rock in situ.  Weathered rock has organic stainings which give rise to a darker colored appearance.
