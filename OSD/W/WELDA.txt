WELDA SERIES

The Welda series consists of deep, well drained soils on stream terraces and uplands. These soils formed in silty sediments. Mean annual precipitation is about 89 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Welda silt loam - in timber. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)
  A1--0 to 15 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine and medium roots; common worm casts; few worm channels; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 centimeters thick)
  A2--15 to 30 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/2) silt loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; few fine roots; few worm casts; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 centimeters thick)
  Bw--30 to 41 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; light gray (10YR 7/2) dry silt coats on surface of peds; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; few worm channels; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 centimeters thick)
  Bt1--41 to 71 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine roots; silt particles on surfaces of peds; thin clay films on surfaces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.
  Bt2--71 to 94 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine and medium roots; thin clay films on faces of peds; porous; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizon is 30 to 76 centimeters thick)
  BC--94 to 122 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) dry; weak coarse blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine roots; moderately acid; diffuse smooth boundary. (23 to 38 centimeters thick) 
  C--122 to 152 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) dry; few fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) mottles; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable; many open pores; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ainsworth, Bonnefemme, Brevator, Clinton, Haymarket, Lunt, and Mirerock series. 
Aimsworth soils formed in silty alluvium 102 to 140 centimeters thick and are underlain by sandy sediments. 
Bonnefemme soils have a lithic contact at 51 to 102 centimeters. 
Brevator soils have more sand throughout the profile. 
Clinton soils do not have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR in the middle third of the series control section. 
Haymarket soils have coarse fragments of diabase and basalt.  
Lunt soils formed in Coastal Plain sediments on sloping to moderate steep uplands. 
Mirerock soils formed in residuum weathered from mafic crystalline rocks such as hornblende gneiss, gabbro, diorite, greenstone, and chlorite-amphibole schist. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: stream terraces or uplands 
Slope: 0 to 15 percent 
Parent material: reddish silty material presumed to be loess older and more weathered than Peoria loess (A few pedons formed in colluvium weathered from sandstone and silty shale.)  
Mean annual temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C. (52 to 57 degrees F.) 
Mean annual precipitation: 81 to 102 centimeters 
Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index: 56 to 70 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Armster, Gymer, 
Ladoga, Reading, and Sharpsburg soils.  
Armster, Ladoga, and Sharpsburg soils are on higher positions.  
Gymer soils are on similar topographic positions as Welda soils.  
Reading soils are on stream terraces below Welda soils.  
Reading and Sharpsburg soils have a mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained 
Runoff: medium or rapid 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated.  
Corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat are the principal crops.  
Some areas are in native timber with oak and hickory the principal trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Kansas and possibly areas in adjoining states; small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

Modified format by LRM in 2/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

09/2008 GJJ removed English units and made some format changes.
