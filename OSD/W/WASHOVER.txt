WASHOVER SERIES

The Washover series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from fanglomerate, limestone, dolomite, and quartzite. Washover soils are on young alluvial fans on mountain toeslopes. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Washover very gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 60 percent gravel.

    Bk2--52 to 105 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine and medium tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct (15 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions around rock fragments and common prominent (10 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 37 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).  (35 to 60 cm thick)

    Bk3--105 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, and few fine and medium tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct (15 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions around rock fragments and common prominent (10 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 38 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION: White Pine County, Nevada; in the south end of the Snake Range, BLM Ely District, in Decathon Canyon about 1 miles north of Big Spring Wash, and about 75 feet east of jeep trail; USGS Minerva Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 47 minutes 20 seconds N and 114 degrees longitude 15 minutes 15 seconds W; UTM zone 11, 0738479e, 4296937n, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter, spring, and early summer, dry in all parts at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice (July and August), but intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September. This soil receives additional run-on moisture; xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 5.5 to 7 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 64 cm.
Depth to calcic horizon: 20 to 30 cm.
Thickness of the calcic horizon: 120 to 130 cm

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 50 to 75 percent mainly gravel. Lithology of the fragments is mainly limestone.

A and ABk horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Organic matter content: 2 to 4 percent.
Structure: Granular or subangular blocky.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 20 to 30 percent.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Bk horizons
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry.
Texture: Loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. 
Clay content: 12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 50 to 75 percent, mainly as gravel.
Structure: Single grain or weak to moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard, dry, nonsticky or slightly plastic, moist.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 30 to 40 percent.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent to violently effervescent.
Secondary calcium carbonates: Common to many (5 to 25 percent) secondary calcium carbonate concretions on the bottom of rock fragments.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Canyonfork series. Canyonfork soils have a mollic epipedon thickness of 25 to 50 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Washover soils are on young alluvial fans on mountain toeslopes. 
These soils formed in alluvium derived from fanglomerate, limestone, dolomite, and quartzite. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 2,130 to 2,800 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid, cool, moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm. These soils receive some additional run-on moisture. Mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C.The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedarcabin, the competing Canyonfork, and Noski soils. Cedarcabin soils are moderately deep. Noski soils have are shallow to indurated fanglomerate.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Washover soils are used for recreation, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, and mountain big sagebrush. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY0127NV, Loamy Fan Piedmont 10-14 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
