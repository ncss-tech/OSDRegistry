WESTSUM SERIES

The Westsum series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in residual material weathered from gray Permian shale. These very gently sloping to gently sloping soils are on lower hillslopes on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 32 inches.

TYPE LOCATION:  Noble County, Oklahoma; about 7 miles east and 4 miles south of Billings; 650 feet north and 150 feet west of the southeast corner Section 8, T. 23 N., R. 1 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is over 55 inches, and the depth to shale is over 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 18 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 10 to 23 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a BA horizon.  The BA horizon, where present has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.

The Btk1 horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.  A few pedons have a few brownish yellow or yellowish brown mottles, and a few pedons have slickensides in this horizon.

The Btk2 horizon, where present has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2.  Texture is silty clay.  A few pedons have a few brownish yellow, light yellowish brown, yellowish red, or yellowish brown mottles, and a few pedons have slickensides in this horizon.

The Cr horizon, where present has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is shale bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brewer, Brewless, Dilworth, Piedmont, Renthin, and Wetbeth series in the same family.  Brewer and Brewless soils are on floodplains.  Dilworth and Piedmont soils have shale bedrock within 40 inches, and Piedmont soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout.  Renthin soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout.  Wetbeth soils are developed in Pleistocene alluvium and have a water table within 30 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Westsum soils are on very gently sloping to gently sloping foot slopes or back slopes on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in material weathered from clayey, gray Permian shale.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 61 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 48 to 60.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Dilworth series, and the Grainola, Highview, Kirkland, and Renfrow series.  Dilworth, Grainola, and Highview soils are on more sloping back slopes of hillsides above the Westsum soils.  Kirkland and Renfrow soils are on higher parts of the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; very slowly permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The principal use is for cropland or rangeland. The principle crop is wheat.  Native vegetation is little bluestem, big bluestem, indiangrass, sideoats grama, hairy grama, blue grama, and buffalograss.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Prairies of Oklahoma and Kansas.  The series is of small extent.
