WIELAND SERIES

The Wieland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Wieland soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wieland soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and upper backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alley, Crooked Creek, Hunnton, and Ocala soils.  Alley soils are fine-loamy.  Crooked Creek soils have mollic epipedons and an aquic moisture regime.  Hunnton soils are moderately deep to indurated duripans.  Ocala soils are fine-silty, have endosaturation within 100 cm, and are saline-sodic.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wieland soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, phlox, Sandberg bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and central Nevada.  These soils are extensive with about 243,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  The series concept and main acreage occurs in MLRA 25.  Other acres of this series are mapped in MLRAs 24 and 28B.
