COMPETING SERIES: This is the Goldstream and Saulich series. Goldstream and Saulich series have substantial mica content in the control section and inferred massive ground ice in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess and alluvium	
Landform: alluvial fans
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 25 degrees F., -4 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: about 11 inches, 280 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Nenana and Richarson. Nenana soils are on alluvial terraces and fans and are well drained. Richardson soils are on alluvial terraces and fans and are moderately well drained

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: poorly drained, moderate runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity rapid in the fibric soil material, moderate in the hemic material and coarse-silty mantle and impermeable in the permafrost.
USE AND VEGETATION: Used for recreation and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation includes stunted black spruce forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229, Interior Alaska lowlands the series is of limited extent.
