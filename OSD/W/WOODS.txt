WOODS SERIES

The Woods series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments derived from the Laverne (Valentine) Member of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils occur on interfluves and hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).
