WILCO SERIES

The Wilco series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy alluvium and eolian deposits over clayey residuum weathered from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping paleoterraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 736 mm (29 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, hyperthermic Typic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wilco loamy fine sand, on a convex, 2 percent slopes in cultivated land; elevation is 149 meters (490feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)
