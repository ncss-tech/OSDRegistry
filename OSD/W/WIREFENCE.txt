WIREFENCE SERIES

The Wirefence series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. Wirefence soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, thermic Pachic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Wirefence loam on a southwest-facing slope of 30 percent under annual and perennial grasses and forbs at an elevation of 384 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on May 6, 2008 the soil was moist throughout.

(15 to 175 centimeters thick)

(0 to 125 centimeters thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California; about 2.5 kilometers west of Ettersberg, CA; USGS Quadrangle Honeydew, CA; WGS84 Decimal degrees 40.1400000 latitude and -124.0258333 longitude; UTM zone 10 0412612mE, 4443812mN; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice. The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 15 to 16 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 6 degrees or greater. The soils have a thermic soil temperature regime.

Thickness of the umbric epipedon: 50 to 125 centimeters

Base Saturation: less than 50 percent by ammonium acetate throughout the soil profile

Surface fragments: 0 to 5 percent gravel

Particle size control section (weighted average): 
Rock fragments: 0 to 34 percent sandstone gravel
Pararock fragments: 0 to 34 percent paragravel
Clay content: 18 to 24 percent

Value: 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 4, 1 to 3 moist
Clay content: 15 to 23 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 34 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel
Pararock fragments: 0 to 34 percent moderately cemented sandstone paragravel

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wirefence soils are on linear to concave summit and backslope positions of predominantly southeast to southwest-facing ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1000 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Windynip (CA)_ and Devilshole (CA) soils. Windynip soils have 24 to 34 percent clay in the particle size control section. Devilshole soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and have fractured bedrock between 100 and 150 centimeters. Windynip soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex summit, shoulder, and backslope positions. Devilshole soils are on convex summit and shoulder positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation is annual and perennial grasses and forbs. Douglas-fir invades readily in the absence of fire and grazing.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
