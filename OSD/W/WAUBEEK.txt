WAUBEEK SERIES

The Waubeek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying glacial till. These soils are on convex summits of interfluves and upper side slopes on dissected uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 83 centimeters (33 inches).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iowa County, Iowa, l965

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 83 centimeters (13 to 33 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches) (Ap, E, Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2BC1, and 2BC2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (0 to 13 inches (Ap and E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 114 centimeters (13 to 45 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters (2 to 6 inches) wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters (3 to 4 feet) deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
