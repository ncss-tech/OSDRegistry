WEBBRIDGE SERIES

The Webbridge series consists of deep, well-drained soils that formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium from basalt.  Webbridge soils are on 35 to 75 percent canyon slopes. Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, isotic Alfic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Webbridge ashy silt loam - on north-facing concave slope of 52 percent at an elevation of 4,520 feet in forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on July 29, 1991, the soil was moist throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Webbridge soils are on steep or very steep canyon sides at elevations of 3,900 to 5,000 feet.  Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium from basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 27 to 29 inches.  The frost-free period is 60 to 70 days.  The average annual air temperature is about 41 to 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Agatha, Cramont, and Shilla soils.  Agatha soils are on south- and west-facing canyon sides, are frigid and xeric, and do not have a volcanic ash mantle.  Cramont soils are on plateaus, are frigid and xeric, do not have a thick ash mantle, and have a clayey subsoil.  Shilla soils are on plateaus, have an argillic horizon, and are frigid and xeric.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained, slow to medium runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for woodland, woodland grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, queencup beadlily, goldthread, longtube twinflower, and onesided wintergreen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho.  The series is of small extent.
