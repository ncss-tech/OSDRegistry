 Cg--40 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam; massive structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Brunswick County, Virginia; about south on Rt. 697 from Rt. 611 on right at 2195 Connell Rd. (Rt. 697); about 375 feet north northwest into field from gated entrance on the White Plains 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle map. Lat. 36 degrees 38 44 north Long 77 degrees 53 43.64 west

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 0 to 12 inches
Rock Fragment Content: 0 to 10 percent, by volume, in the soil
Soil Reaction: strongly acid to very strongly acid, except where limed
Clay content: 35 to 55 percent in the particle-size control section. 

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
The A horizon has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 6 and chroma of 0 through 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. 

The Eg horizon has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 0 through 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. 

The BEg or EBg horizon has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. It may have mottles. It is sandy clay loam or clay loam. The B2 horizon is sandy clay, clay loam, or clay. 

The Btg horizon is neutral or has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It may have mottles. It is sandy clay, clay loam, or clay. 

The BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2. It commonly is mottled. It is sandy clay loam or clay loam. 

The 2Cg or Cg horizon color has a hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no other series in this family. Chickahominy, Gertie, Pooler, Pouncey, and Roanoke are similar soils in related families. Chickahominy, Gertie and Pooler soils are formed in coastal plain sediments.  Roanoke soils occur on stream terraces and formed in alluvial sediments. Pouncey soils have an abrupt textural change (clay increase) at the top of the argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Worsham soils are in depressions, at the heads of drains, at the base of slopes, and on upland flats in the Piedmont Plateau. The slopes are generally concave or slightly convex. Slope is dominately between 1 and 4 percent, but ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Worsham soils formed in local alluvium derived from granite, gneiss or schist. Annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 degrees F to 59 degrees F. The growing season is 180 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Appling, Colfax, Hard Labor, Helena, Mattaponi, Santuc, and Vance series. Appling and Vance soils are well drained. Colfax soils have a fragipan. Helena and Santuc soils are moderately well drained. Hard Labor and Mattaponi soils have a water table between 2.5 and 5 feet.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage Class (Agricultural):  Poorly drained
Index Surface Runoff: High
Permeability: Very slow

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most of the Worsham soils are in woodland or pasture, and only a very small amount is in crops. Crops are corn, soybeans, sorghum, and mixed hay. Native vegetation is sweetgum, blackgum, willow oak, pin oak, alder, elm, willow and other species or water-tolerant plants and some pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
In the southern part of the Piedmont Plateau in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. The series is of small extent.
MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Prince Edward County, Virginia, 1901.

REMARKS: The 2001 revision removes the less than 30 percent silt requirement from the particle size control section. That requirement was previously added to differentiate Worsham and Roanoke soils. The 2007 revision moves the type location to the typical pedon for the Brunswick County, Virginia soil survey.  

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:

Argillic horizon, Aquic conditions, Ochric epipedon
