COMPETING SERIES:
There are no other series in this family. Soils in similar families include: 
Chickahominy soils--formed in clayey fluvial sediments on Coastal Plain river terraces 
Gertie soils--formed in clayey marine and fluviomarine sediments on terraces and broad flats in the Coastal Plain 
Pooler soils--formed in coastal plain sediments and have a solum thickness greater than 60 inches

Roanoke soils--formed in alluvial sediments and occur on stream terraces 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Piedmont uplands 
Landform: Depressions, heads of drains, base of slopes, upland flats
Parent Material: Local alluvium derived from granite, gneiss or schist. The slopes are generally concave or slightly convex. Slope is dominantly between 1 and 4 percent, but ranges from 0 to 8 percent. 
Mean Annual Precipitation: 889 to 1143 millimeters (35 to 45 inches) 
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 15 to 19 degrees C (59 to 66 degrees F) 
Frost-free period: 180 to 210 days

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Woodland or pasture.  A very small amount is in cropland.  
Dominant Vegetation: Where wooded--sweetgum, blackgum, willow oak, pin oak, alder, elm, willow and other species or water-tolerant plants and some pine. Where cultivated-corn, soybeans, or sorghum

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama 
Extent: Small 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Prince Edward County, Virginia, 1901.
REMARKS: The 2001 revision removes the less than 30 percent silt requirement from the particle size control section. That requirement was previously added to differentiate Worsham and Roanoke soils. The 2007 revision moves the type location to the typical pedon for the Brunswick County, Virginia soil survey.  The 2025 revision changed the format. No data was changed

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Ap and Eg horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 13 to 152 centimeters (5 to 60 inches) at some time during the year.
Argillic horizon-the zone from 15 to 89 centimeters (10 to 35 inches) (Btg horizons)
