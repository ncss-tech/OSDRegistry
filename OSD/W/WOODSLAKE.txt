WOODSLAKE SERIES

The Woodslake series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils.  They formed in clayey, calcareous lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains.  These soils have very slow permeability. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Woodslake clay with a plane level slope in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 7 inches; black (10YR 2/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; firm; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

   Bg--7 to 10 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) clay; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) mottles; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very firm; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 16 inches thick)

   BCg--10 to 19 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and few fine prominent light gray (10YR 7/2) mottles; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; firm; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

   Cg1--19 to 45 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay; many fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and common fine distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) mottles; massive; firm; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

   Cg2--45 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), few fine prominent pink (7.5YR 7/4), common medium prominent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), and few fine prominent light gray (10YR 7/1) mottles; massive; firm; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota; about 1 mile east of Baudette; 1400 feet east and 2600 feet south of the northwest corner of section 6, T. 160 N., R. 30 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to carbonates ranges from 11 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 9 inches thick.  (The A horizon in some pedons is slightly thinner but the upper 7 inches after mixing qualifies as a mollic epipedon.)

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is N 2/0.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  Some pedons have enough organic carbon to use a mucky modifier.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Woodslake soils have slightly concave or plane slopes of less than 1 percent.  They formed in clayey, calcareous lacustrine sediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 41 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clearwater, Indus, Spooner, and Wildwood soils.  Clearwater and Indus soils occupy slightly higher positions in the landscape.  Spooner soils formed in silty lacustrine sediments.  Wildwood soils occupy bogs and have histic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained and poorly drained.  Surface runoff is very slow to ponded.  Permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Some areas are cropped to small grain or are in hay and pasture.  Some areas are in native vegetation of willow, black ash, balm of gilead, balsam fir, black spruce, and white spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Minnesota, primarily the Glacial Lake Agassiz plain.  This soil is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota, 1989.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); aquic moisture regime - low chroma immediately below the mollic epipedon.

Classification only was changed 5/94.  Competing series and other updates will be made later.
