WARFIELD SERIES

Warfield series consists of deep and very deep, well-drained soils on moraines in glaciated mountains. Warfield soils formed a mixed mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium over till dominated by granitic rocks. Slopes are 15 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature about 40 degrees F.
