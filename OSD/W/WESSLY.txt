WESSLY SERIES

The Wessly series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on depressions on alluvial flats on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wessly sandy clay loam -- rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

TYPE LOCATION:  Otero County, New Mexico; approximately 14 miles west and 16.5 miles south of Oro Grande; 2,500 feet west and 3,600 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 16, T. 25 S., R. 6 E.; USGS Newman NE topographic quadrangle; latitude 32 degrees 7 minutes 46.26 seconds north longitude 106 degrees 20 minutes 1.55 seconds west.  UTM Zone 13, 0374194E, 3555382N; NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts more than three-fourths of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature:  63 to 67 degrees F.

Depth to calcic horizon:  40 to 60 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):

Clay content: 18 to 27 percent

Coarse fragment content:  0 to 5 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  less than 5 percent (less than 2 mm fraction)

A horizon:
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4, dry or moist
Coarse fragments: mixed igneous fragments; 0 to 5 percent gravel size fragments

Bk horizon:
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Coarse fragments: mixed igneous fragments; 0 to 5 percent gravel size fragments

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Mescal (AZ) and Panor (NV) series. 
The Mescal soils are on uplands with greater than 5 percent slopes and they receive more than 13 inches annual precipitation.  Also they do not have segregated calcium carbonate. 
The Panor soils receive 3 to 5 inches annual precipitation and have gypsum in the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: alluvium
Landform: depressions on the alluvial flat of basin floors
Slope: 1 to 3 percent
Mean annual temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 200 to 240 days
Elevation: 3,900 to 4,200 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Copia, Foxtrot, Hueco, and Nations soils.
Copia soils do not have segregated carbonates and are on sand sheets on the basin floor.
Foxtrot, Hueco, and Nations soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on the basin floor.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is negligible.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is of the desert shrub type consisting of mesquite, broom snakeweed, fourwing saltbush, yucca elata, and spectaclepod.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Trans-Pecos of Texas and southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42; small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Otero County, New Mexico; 2001.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk2, Bk3, Bk4 horizons)

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 7 inches. (A, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons, mixed to 7 inches)

Calcic horizon:  The zone from 46 to 80 inches.  (Bk5 and Bk6 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
