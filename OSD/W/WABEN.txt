WABEN SERIES 

The Waben series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in very cherty alluvium and colluvium.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on narrow terraces, alluvial-colluvial fans and toe slopes of the Ozark Highlands.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, mesic Ultic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Waben very gravelly silt loam, 5 percent slope, forested. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--O to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly silt loam; strong fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; about 45 percent by volume angular chert fragments 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (1 to 8 inches thick) 

   E--5 to 15 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common fine roots; about 40 percent by volume angular chert fragments 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

   Bt--15 to 40 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly silt loam; many coarse distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; thin patchy clay films on ped faces and chert fragments; about 60 percent by volume angular chert fragments 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 35 inches thick) 

   BC--40 to 72 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly silt loam; many coarse faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; about 70 percent by volume angular chert fragments 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter; moderately acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Benton County, Arkansas; 2 miles south of Springtown and 50 feet north of gravel road; SE1/4NE1/4SW1/4, sec. 18, T. 17 N., R. 32W.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Tilk series. Tilk soils average 40 to 60 percent fine and coarser sand in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Waben soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep terraces, toe slopes and alluvial-colluvial fans in the Ozark Highlands and other areas with cherty limestone bedrock. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F and the average annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 46 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Clarksville and Noark soils and Britwater, Elsah, Nixa, and Secesh soils.  Britwater soils, which are on broader stream terraces, contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Elsah soils, which are on floodplains, do not have an argilic horizon.  Nixa soils, which are on ridgetops, contains a fragipans and have lower base saturation.  Secesh soils, which are on floodplains, contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. The runoff index is very low to low.  Permeability is moderately rapid. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cleared and used mainly for pasture and hay.  Native vegetation was mixed hardwoods, mostly red oak, white oak, post oak, hickory and black walnut. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks Highlands region (MLRA 116A) of Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas.  The series is of moderate extent.
