WAPSHILLA SERIES

The Wapshilla series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with basalt colluvium.  Wapshilla soils are on high plateaus, mountain slopes and higher north-facing canyon slopes and have slopes of 8 to 90 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Umbric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wapshilla loam, woodlands (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    0i--0 to 0.5 inch; slightly decomposed organic material, slightly acid (pH 6.4).

    Oa--0.5 to 1 inch; well decomposed organic material; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

    A--1 to 5 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard very friable slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

    BA--5 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and very fine structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt1--15 to 23 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films; common fine roots; 20 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2--23 to 37 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common distinct clay films; few fine and medium roots; 30 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt3--37 to 51 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common faint clay films; few medium roots; 50 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 35 inches thick)

    BC--51 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; 50 percent pebbles and 10 cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wapshilla soils are on high plateaus, mountains, and high north-facing canyon walls, and have gradients of 8 to 90 percent.  They formed in loess mixed with basalt colluvium.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is humid with snowy winter and moderately warm dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 26 to 28 inches.  Average January temperature is 24 degrees F.; average July temperature is 65 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 41 degrees to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brody, Klickson, Telcher, Culdesac, Cramont and Zaza soils.  Brody and Culdesac soils have Bw horizons and much volcanic ash in the surface layers.  Klickson soils are Mollic.  Telcher soil have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil.  Cramont soils have fine textured argillic horizons with few rock fragments.  Zaza soils have bedrock at a depth of less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; rapid and very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for woodland.  Some areas are being grazed.  Vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, western larch and a wide assortment of small forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  Series is inextensive.
