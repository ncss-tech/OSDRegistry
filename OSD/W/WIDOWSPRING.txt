WIDOWSPRING SERIES

The Widowspring series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous sources.  Widowspring soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Widowspring silt loam - irrigated pasture, on a 2 percent slope, at an elevation of 1,280 meters.  (When described on August 28, 1978 the soil was moist throughout.  Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--18 to 56 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 38 to 71 cm.)

    AB--56 to 71 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw--71 to 109 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many faint reddish brown (5YR 4/4) iron accumulations, neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the AB and Bw horizon is 38 to 76 cm.)

    2C--109 to 160 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) iron accumulations; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Harney County, Oregon, about 3 miles northwest of Burns, about 1,100 feet north and 400 feet east of the southwest corner of section 26, T. 22 S., R. 30 E., on the Poison Creek 7.5' quadrangle;  latitude 43 degrees 37 minutes 54 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 5 minutes 48 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days after the summer months. A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 90 to 150 cm from November through July.  
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.  
Mollic epipedon: 50 to 114 cm thick.  
Bedrock: Deeper than 150 cm.  
Depth to redoximorphic accumulations: 64 to 114 cm.  
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 20 to 35 percent. 
Coarser than very fine sand: 5 to 15 percent. 

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist,
Chroma: 2 moist and dry.  Chroma of 3 may occur in the lower part.  
AB and Bw horizons
Texture: Silt loam or silty clay loam. Clay 20 to 35 percent.  

2C horizon
Texture:silt loam or loam.
Clay content: 20 to 25 percent.  

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Widowspring soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Elevation is 1,220 to 1,550 meters.  The climate is characterized by cold, moist winters, and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.  The frost free period is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crowcamp, Fury, and Voltage soils.  Crowcamp soils are on stream terraces, are in the fine particle-size family and have carbonates in the lower subsoil.  Fury soils are on stream terraces, and are poorly drained.  Voltage soils are on lake terraces, are in the coarse loamy particle-size family, and have moderately to strongly alkaline soil reaction.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. A seasonal high water table from 90 to 150 cm below the surface at some time from November through July (endosaturation); up to 15 cm above the surface at some time from March through May (rare ponding).

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for alfalfa and hay production, and livestock grazing.  The potential native vegetation is basin big sagebrush, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Pleistocene lake basins of southeastern Oregon; MLRA 23.  Series is of small extent.
