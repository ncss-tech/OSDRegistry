WHEATBELT SERIES

The Wheatbelt series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Mean annual air air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Sodic Epiaquerts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wheatbelt clay, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ag--0 to 2 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; strong very coarse granular structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    Bnssg--2 to 16 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; moderate very fine and fine angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; common slickensides intersecting at 30 to 45 degrees from horizontal; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 29 inches thick)

    Bnssyzg1--16 to 38 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine pores; common slickensides intersecting at 30 to 45 degrees from horizontal; many fine masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 23 inches thick)

    Bnssyzg2--38 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine pores; many slickensides intersecting at 30 to 60 degrees from horizontal; common fine masses of gypsum and other salts; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Hill County, Montana; 2,300 feet north and 2,100 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 17, T. 37 N., R. 13 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F.

Soil moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches; dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees or higher.

Depth to Bnssg horizon - 1 to 30 inches.

Depth to Bnssyzg horizon - 5 to 30 inches.

This soil, when dry, has cracks that are at least 1 cm wide at a depth of 20 inches.  A Bng horizon is allowed.

Water table - ponded, +0.5 to 1.0 foot during part of the growing season in most years.

Clay content:  60 to 85 percent

Electrical conductivity:  2 to 8 mmhos/cm

Sodium adsorption ratio:  4 to 13

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 9.0



Bnssg horizon - Value:  4 or 5 dry; 2.5, 3 or 4 moist

Texture:  clay, silty clay

Clay content:  60 to 85 percent

Electrical conductivity:  2 to 8 mmhos/cm

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - lake plains.

Elevation - 2,700 to 2,800 feet.

Slope - 0 to 1 percent.

Parent material - glaciolacustrine deposits.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls during spring and early summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 100 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wheatbelt soils are used as rangeland.  The potential plant community is western wheatgrass, inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, greasewood, and gardner saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Wheatbelt soils are of small extent in north-central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hill County, Montana, 1994; proposed in Hill County, Montana, 1992.  Wheatbelt is the name of an early Hill County community.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1353.

The diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - from the surface to 7 inches (mixed Ag, Bnssg horizons); slickensides - from 2 to 60 inches (Bnssg, Bnssyzg1, Bnssyzg2 horizons); particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches.  Wheatbelt soils have a frigid temperature regime and aquic conditions that border on aridic.
