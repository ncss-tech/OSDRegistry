Craigsaddle soils are 100 to 150 cm to a densic contact and are formed in trondhjemite granitoid rock. Flanly soils are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact and are formed in granodiorite. Millvilla soils are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact and are formed in metasedimentary rock. Motherlode soils are 100 to 150 cm to a lithic contact and are formed in metavolcanic rock. Sierra soils are greater than 150 cm to a root-restrictive bedrock contact and are formed in granodiorite. Thompsonflat soils are 100 to 150 cm to a duripan and have well rounded gravel in the lower part. Verjeles soils are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact and are formed in intrusive basic igneous rock. Yellowlark soils are 100 to 150 cm to a duripan and are formed in alluvium.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wardsferry soils are on backslope positions on hills. Slopes range from 3 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from metasedimentary phyllite and schist. Elevation is 300 to 700 meters. The mean annual precipitation is to 705 to 910 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 14 to 16 degrees C. The frost-free season is 220 to 310 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aquariusmine, Deerflat, Hetchy, Millvilla, and Sanguinetti soils. All occur on hills and are derived from metasedimentary rocks. The Aquariusmine soils are 100 to 150cm to a lithic contact of indurated marble and are on backslopes and footslopes. The Deerflat soils are greater than 150cm to a bedrock contact, and are on footslopes and backslopes. The Hetchy and Millvilla soils are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact and are on backslopes, shoulders and summits of ridges and hills. The Sanguinetti soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are on backslopes and footslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is moderately low to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for watershed, wildlife habitat, recreation, and home site development. Vegetation is interior live oak, blue oak, California foothill pine, Pacific poison oak, whiteleaf manzanita, toyon, buckbrush, California buckthorn, California yerba santa, and squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. The soils are moderately extensive.
