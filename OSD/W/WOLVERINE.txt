WOLVERINE SERIES

The Wolverine series consists of deep or very deep  excessively or somewhat excessively drained  drained soils on basalt plains and in lke basins.  They formed in eolian alluvial sands.  The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Xeric Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wolverine sand, sagebrush and grass.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; about 15 percent very dark gray basalt sand; single grain; loose; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slight effervescence; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (1 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--6 to 17 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand containing about 20 percent basalt sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slight effervescence; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 31 inches thick)

    C2--17 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand containing about 20 percent basalt sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slight effervescence; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8).  (14 to 120 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Bingham County, Idaho; about 3 miles west and 3 miles north of Blackfoot; 700 feet west and 130 feet north of the SE corner of section 30, T.2S., R.36E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Average annual soil temperature - 40 to 47 degrees F.
Average summer temperature - 59 to 62 degrees F.
Soil moisture - usually dry, but are moist for 60 to 80 days in early spring
Particle-size control section:
Texture - LCOS, COS, S, FS, LFS
Coarse fragments - Less than 15 percent
It is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.

A horizon
Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Organic matter - 0.2 to 0.7 percent

C horizons
Hue 2.5Y or 10YR
Value - 5 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3, dry or moist
Some pedons have consolidated lacustrine sediment below a depth of 50 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Eginbench soil.  Eginbench soils have a water table.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are in eolian sands, principally of quartz, feldspars, and other light colored particles, but including about 10 to 30 percent of ferromagnesium or other dark particles.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches.  The average frost free period is 50 to 125 days.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Firth and Wapello soils.   Firth soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on adjacent stream terraces.  Wapello soils are well drained and are on adjacent stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:   Excessively or somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for grazing and irrigated cropland.  The principal native plants are cheatgrass, big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, Russian thistle, prickly pear, sanddune wildrye, sand dropseed, and basin wildrye.  The major crops are potatoes, wheat, and barley.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is extensive in the upper Snake River Valley in eastern Idaho and in the lake basins of Southeastern Oregon.
