WINGAP SERIES

The Wingap series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granite.  The Wingap soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.

Dovecanyon, Goldivide, Goldpeak, Helendale, Searchlight, Sonoita, and Tray soils are very deep. Dovecanyon soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 18 to 22 degrees C. Goldivide, Helendale, and Searchlight soils receive summer precipitation and are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms. Goldivide soils also have secondary calcium carbonate at 25 to 75 centimeters and the depth to the top of the argillic horizon is 50 to 100 centimeters. Helendale soils also have secondary calcium carbonates at 100 to 150 centimeters. Searchlight soils are also calcareous throughout and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 19 to 22 degrees C. Sonoita soils also have secondary calcium carbonates at 25 to 75 centimeters and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the moisture control section between July and October. Tray soils are also calcareous throughout and have strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline argillic horizons with exchangeable sodium percentages (ESP) of 15 to 30 percent.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wingap soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. The soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granite.  Elevations are 1,150 to 1,700 meters.  The climate is arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 230 millimeters, mostly in the form of winter rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees to 16 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 165 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dovecanyon, Pinyonpeak and Goldpeak soils.  Dovecanyon soils occur on fan remnants at lower elevations and have mean annual soil temperatures ranging from 18.1 to 22 degrees C. Pinyonpeak soils occur on the upper part of hills, and are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Goldpeak soils occur on fan remnants, and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low or medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the subsoil and low in the underlying material.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is blackbrush, narrowleaf rabbitbrush, Sandberg bluegrass, Nevada ephedra, and Joshua tree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Mojave Desert of southeastern California, U.S.A.; MLRA 29.  The soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.
