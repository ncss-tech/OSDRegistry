WOODLY SERIES

The Woodly series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy alluvium in upland swales and on foot slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Woodly fine sandy loam is on a nearly level slope of less than 1 percent slope in native grass.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described the soil was dry throughout.  

  A1--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); very dark gray (l0YR 3/1) fine sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine and medium granular and subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A2--23 to 43 centimeters (9 to 17 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

  A3--43 to 53 centimeters (17 to 21 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist rubbed; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined A horizon is 25 to 61 centimeters (10 to 24 inches) thick.)

  Bt1--53 to 84 centimeters (21 to 33 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist rubbed; strong coarse and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium blocky; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; clay films on faces of peds; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

  Bt2--84 to 102 centimeters (33 to 40 inches); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) and very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist rubbed; moderate coarse and fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine blocky; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; clay films on faces of peds; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined Bt horizon is 30 to 76 centimeters (12 to 30 inches) thick.)

  BC--102 to 127 centimeters (40 to 50 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; very hard, firm, slightly sticky; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) coatings on faces of peds; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) thick)

  C--127 to 152 centimeters (50 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mellette County, South Dakota; 201 meters (660 feet) east and 128 meters (420 feet) south of the northwest corner of sec. 15, T. 40 N., R. 29 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Solum thickness: 76 to 152 centimeters (30 to 60 inches)
Free carbonates: typically lacks throughout, but some pedons have carbonates between 64 and 152 centimeters (25 and 60 inches)
Mollic epipedon: 51 to 114 centimeters (20 to 45 inches) extends into the Bt horizon of some pedons  
Dark colored buried horizons are in some pedons below the argillic horizon.

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: fine sandy loam or loam but may be loamy fine sand in sandy areas reworked by wind
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 or 5, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: typically sandy clay loam but may be fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam averaging between 18 and 27 percent clay
Structure: moderate or strong prismatic parting to weak or moderate, medium or fine blocky
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

BC horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 7, 3 to 6 moist

Some pedons have a Bk horizon.

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4

Bluewater soils contain a calcic horizon within 90 centimeters (35 inches)
Farnum soils lack buried horizons within the profile
Funmar soils contain a paleosol within 100 centimeters (40 inches)
Garrett soils have hue of 5YR or redder
Haxtun soils have buried horizons within the Bt horizons
Jarita soils have redder hues in the Bt horizons
Keya soils contain less sand and more silt

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: upland swales and on gently sloping concave foot slopes

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anselmo, Jayem, Manter, Vetal, and Tuthill soils.  
Anselmo, Jayem, and Tuthill soils are somewhat higher in the landscape than the Woodly soils.  
Anselmo soils lack argillic horizons.  
Jayem soils are coarse-loamy.  
Tuthill soils have mollic epipedons less than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick and are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  
Manter soils contain less clay and are on similar landscapes.  
Vetal soils are coarse-loamy and are in similar landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: moderately well drained and well drained
Runoff: low or medium
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION:  About equally divided between cropland and rangeland or hayland.  
Corn, sorghum, small grain, and alfalfa are the main crops.  
Native grasses include western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needleandthread, blue grama, and sand dropseed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central and southwestern South Dakota and western and southwestern Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.
