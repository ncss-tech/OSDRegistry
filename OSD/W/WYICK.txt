SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Refugio County, Texas; 1984.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Edna, Vidauri, and Orelia series.  The series was reclassified in 2006 based on lab data and soil moisture monitoring.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 15 to 66 cm (6 to 26 in).  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in).  (A horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk1, Btk2, and Btk3 horizons)
Calcic horizon: 76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 in) (Btk1, Btk2, Btk3 horizons)

Additional Comments: 
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S03TX-175-002 from Goliad County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory data exists on pedon ID S03TX-175-002 from the type location.  Additional data National Soil Survey Laboratory data exists on pedon ID S01TX-175-001.  Soil moisture monitoring data collected from site of pedon ID S01TX-175-001.
