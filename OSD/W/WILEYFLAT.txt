WILEYFLAT SERIES

The Wileyflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in ash mixed with colluvium over residuum from pyroclastic tuffs. These soils are on plateau tops and ridges with slopes from 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Wileyflat channery ashy sandy loam - upland forest, on a 3 percent south slope. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wileyflat soils are on plateau tops and ridges. Elevation is 4000 to 6800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. These soils formed in ash mixed with colluvium over residuum from pyroclastic tuffs. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ateron, Egyptcreek, Forbord (T),  Jushro (T), Maule (T) and  Sintuf (T)  soils.  Ateron, Sintuf and Jushro soils are 10 to 20 inches to bedrock on plateau tops and shoulders of escarpments.  Egyptcreek and Forbord soils are greater than 40 inches deep.  Egyptcreek soils are on drainway sideslopes and hillslopes. Forbord soils are on the upland forest border with shrub steppe.  Maule soils are clayey-skeletal in the control section and are on mountain sideslopes and hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wileyflat soils are used mainly for timber, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, bitterbrush, elk sedge, western stipa and Wheelers bluegrass.
Blue Mountain Plant Association CPS2-22 (Ponderosa pine/bitterbrush-elk sedge), (Johnson and Clausnitzer, 1992, Plant Associations of the Blue and Ochoco Mountains.) These soils support dry and moist pine, plant association groups.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Oregon, MLRA 10.  This series is of moderate extent.
