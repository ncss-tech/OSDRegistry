WINONA SERIES  

The Winona series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Winona soils are on plateaus and hills and have slopes of 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Winona extremely gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 60 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent, 32 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)  

    Bw--2 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble; violently effervescent, 37 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)  

    Bk--10 to 17 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble; many coarse soft calcium carbonate masses and thin coatings on rock fragments; violently effervescent, 54 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 8 inches thick)  

    2R--17 inches; fractured limestone; discontinuous calcium carbonate coatings.  

TYPE LOCATION:  Coconino County, Arizona; 1900 feet north and 2200 feet east of the southwest corner of section 15. T. 32 N., R. 4 W.  

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.  

Soil Temperature - 48 to 56 degrees F.  

Rock fragments - 35 to 70 percent limestone and chert gravel, channers, cobble and flagstones  

Depth to bedrock - 6 to 20 inches  

Calcium carbonate - 40 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent  

A horizon  
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR  
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist  
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry  
Reaction:  slightly or moderately alkaline  

Bk horizon  
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR  
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist  
Chroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist  
Texture:  loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam (15 to 30 percent clay)  
Calcium carbonate:  segregated and as coatings on rock fragments  
Bw horizon is not present in all pedons.  

COMPETING SERIES:  Competing series are the Scrapy (NV), Splimo (UT) and Yaki (UT) series.
Scrapy soils have a calcic horizon at 1 to 3 inches below the surface.
Splimo soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees and a calcic horizon at 5 to 10 inches deep.
Yaki soils do not have Bw horizon and the profile is dominated by cobbles.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winona soils are on plateaus and hills.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 15 percent, but range from 0 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in eolian deposits over alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Elevations range from 4700 to 7100 feet.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 14 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain and snow.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 54 degrees F.  The mean temperature for July is 71 degrees F. and for December is 31 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Boysag, Tovar, and Tusayan soils.  Boysag and Tovar soils have argillic horizons. Tusayan soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is blue grama, black grama, needleandthread, galleta, sand and spike dropseed, hairy grama, muttongrass, bottlebrush, squirreltail, alkali sacaton, winterfat, bigelow sage, fourwing saltbush, cliffrose, juniper and pinyon pine.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona and west central New Mexico. MLRAs 35, 36, 38 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:   Coconino County, (Long Valley Area), Arizona; 1971.  

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)  

Calcic horizon - The zone from 10 to 17 inches (Bk horizon)  

Lithic contact - The boundary at 17 inches (2R horizon)  

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Eleventh Edition, 2010

The type location is moved to a site with carbonatic mineralogy.  The original site averaged 29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  New Mexico has correlated and published Winona as carbonatic or the mineralogy would be reclassified as mixed.
