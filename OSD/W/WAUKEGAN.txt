WAUKEGAN SERIES

The Waukegan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess or silty glacial alluvium and in the underlying sandy or sandy-skeletal glacial outwash. These soils are on slightly concave to convex slopes on glacial outwash plains and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 837 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Waukegan silt loam, on a plane level slope, on a valley train, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Bw3--76 to 84 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few brown (10YR 4/3) coats on faces of peds; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 25 to 65 centimeters.)

 2BC--84 to 132 centimeters; mixed brown (10YR 5/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; about 15 percent rock fragments; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 60 centimeters thick) 

 2C--132 to 203 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; about 20 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.
