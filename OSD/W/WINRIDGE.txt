WINRIDGE SERIES



The Winridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils

that formed in latite, andesite and welded tuff.  Winridge soils are on

mountainsides and have slopes of 15 to 60 percent.  Permeability is

very slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and

the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Pachic Argicryolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Winridge clay loam - on a 38 percent slope at an

elevation of 6,250 feet in rangeland.  When described on August 8,

1979, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless

otherwise noted)



    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very

dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky

structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine

roots; common very fine tubular pores; about 10 percent pebbles;

vertical cracks 1 to 3 cm wide, 10 to 20 cm apart, slightly acid (pH

6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)



    Bt1--4 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay,

very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky

structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and plastic; common very fine,

fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; about 15

percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; vertical cracks 1 to 3 cm wide

and 10 to 20 cm apart, many moderately thick clay films on ped faces;

slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick)



    Bt2--10 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3)

moist; strong medium and coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard,

very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine, and

medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; about 10 percent pebbles;

vertical cracks 1 to 2 cm wide and 10 to 20 cm apart; continuous

moderately thick clay films on ped faces; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear

wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)



    Bt3--16 to 23 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) sandy clay loam, dark

grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky

structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine

roots; many very fine tubular pores; about 5 percent fine pebbles;

common thin clay films on ped faces; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear

smooth boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)



    R--23 inches decomposing andesite bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cimarron and Gourley series.  Cimarron

and Gourley soils lack bedrock above a depth of 40 inches.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winridge soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range

from 15 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 7,500 feet.  The

soil formed in latite, andesite and welded tuff.  The average annual

precipitation is 16 to 20 inches, most of which falls as snow and early

spring rain.  The average annual temperature is about 37 degrees to 41

degrees F.  The frost free season is less than 60 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Friedman, Winu,

Elksel, and Starhope soils.  Friedman and Winu soils have a mollic

epipedon greater than 20 inches thick.  Elksel and Starhope soils have

an annual summer soil temperature greater than 59 degrees F and are on

south and west-facing slopes.  Friedman and Winu soils occur on north

and east-facing slopes.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to very

rapid.  Permeability is very slow.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is Low

sagebrush, Hoods phlox, Idaho fescue, and Sandberg bluegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  This series is of

limited extent.
