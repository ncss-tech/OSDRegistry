WINDHAM SERIES 

The Windham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in very gravelly alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from limestone. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, structural benches, escarpments, ridges, divides, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 85 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Typic Calciustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Windham gravelly clay loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent limestone gravel; continuous distinct lime casts on undersides of gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk1--6 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 20 percent limestone gravel; continuous prominent casts and pendants on undersides of gravel; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk2--12 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) extremely gravelly loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 55 percent limestone gravel, 5 percent limestone cobbles; common fine masses of lime; continuous prominent lime casts and pendants on underside of gravel and cobbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); diffuse wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons is 15 to 33 inches.) 

    Bk3--18 to 61 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common to few fine and very fine pores; 60 percent limestone gravel, 10 percent cobbles; common fine masses of lime; continuous distinct lime casts and pendants on undersides of gravel and cobbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
