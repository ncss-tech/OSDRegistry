WOLFESON SERIES

The Wolfeson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial material and glaciolacustrine deposits with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Wolfeson soils are on glacial outwash terraces and relict glacial lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wolfeson soils are on glacial lake terraces at elevations of 1,700 to 2,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches; the average annual temperature is 43 degrees F.; the frost free season is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kaniksu, Fan Lake, Bridgeson, Peone, and Stapaloop soils. Kaniksu soils are well drained, contain lamellae and occur on terraces. Fan Lake soils are moderately well drained and have andic soil properties; they generally occur on terraces above the Wolfeson series. Bridgeson soils are fine loamy, poorly drained, and occur in drainageways. Peone soils are ashy with glassy mineralogy, poorly drained, and occur on alluvial fans, drainageways, and depressional areas. Stapaloop soils are well drained and occur on terraces and footslopes and toeslopes of foothills. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. An apparent water table is present at its upper most limit February through April. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Principal use includes production of timber, grazed woodland, small grains and grass. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, western larch, ponderosa pine, grand fir, white pine, aspen, Oregon grape, strawberry, elk sedge, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, pathfinder, Columbia brome, Idaho goldthread, oceanspray, myrtle pachistima, and baldhip rose. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. The series is of small extent. MLRA 44A. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington, 2012. Named for the nearby town of Wolfeson, WA. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches. (Ap horizon) 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 9 to 37 inches. (Bw1, and Bw2 horizons) 
Particle size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches. (Part of the Bw1, Bw2, and part of the C1 horizon) 
Vitrandic feature -- The zone from 0 to 21 inches (A and Bw1 horizons) 
Oxyaquic feature -- The zone beginning at 21 inches having saturation with water for 30 or more cumulative days. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: 
Areas of Wolfeson soils were previously mapped with a mesic soil temperature regime in Stevens County and northern Spokane County, Washington. As of 8/2011 the Wolfeson series has been investigated over it's entire extent by the MLRA SSO Leader from Spokane, WA and has been determined to have a frigid soil temperature regime based on natural vegetation. 

The 8/2011 posting reflects a redescription of the type location pedon and a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haploxerepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Oxyaquic Vitrandic Haploxerepts. 

Further investigation is needed to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).
