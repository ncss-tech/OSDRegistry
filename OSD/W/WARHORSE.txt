WARHORSE SERIES

The Warhorse series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Warhorse loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--4 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common distinct clay skins on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    BC-11 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; 75 percent soft shale fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Cr--18 to 60 inches; semiconsolidated interbedded shale and sandstone; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6)

TYPE LOCATION:  Petroleum County, Montana; 2,600 feet east and 200 feet south of the northwest corner of section 14, T. 15 N, R. 26 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between  4 and 12 inches.

Depth to Cr horizon - 10 to 20 inches.

A horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y Value:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist Chroma: 2 or 3 Texture:  loam or clay loam Clay content:  18 to 35 percent Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent--0 to 5 percent cobbles; 0 to 10 percent pebbles EC:  0 to 2 mmhos/cm Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.8

Bt horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y Value:  4 or 5 dry; 3 or 4 moist Chroma:  2 or 3 Texture:  clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay Clay content:  35 to 45 percent Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent pebbles EC: 0 to 2 mmhos/cm Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.8

BC horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y Value:  4, 5, or 6 dry; 3, 4, or 5 moist Chroma:  2 or 3 Texture:  clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay Clay content:  30 to 45 percent Rock fragments:  50 to 90 percent--50 to 80 percent soft shale fragments; 0 to 10 percent hard sandstone fragments EC:  0 to 4 mmhos/cm Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 8.4 NOTE:  Some pedons have a thin accumulation of secondary carbonates at the shale contact.

Cr horizon--Semiconsolidated sedimentary beds consisting of interbedded shale and fine grained sandstone.  Extremely hard or very hard when dry and extremely firm or very firm when moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains and hills.

Elevation - 1,900 to 4,200 feet.

Slope - 0 to 15 percent.

Parent material - material derived from semiconsolidated interbedded shale and sandstone.

Climate - long, cold winters;  moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 105 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is dominantly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is of limited extent in central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Petroleum County, Montana, 1989.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1110.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 4 inches (A horizon); argillic horizon - from 4 to 11 inches (Bt horizon); paralithic contact - at 18 inches (Cr horizon); particle-size control section - from 4 to 11 inches (Bt horizon). Warhorse soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

Series will be reclassified to Aridic subgoup if allowed for frigid temperature regime. (7/96-CJH)
