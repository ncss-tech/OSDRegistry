WOLFTAIL SERIES

The Wolftail series consists of shallow, very poorly drained soils that formed in volcanic ash mixed with alluvium over residuum from metasedimentary rock. These soils occur on drainageways on cirque platforms. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,475 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, nonacid Lithic Cryaquands

TYPICAL PEDON: Wolftail ashy silt loam, in meadows and open coniferous forest. This profile was described on a 12 percent slope at 2,185 meters elevation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 6 cm; black (10YR 2/1) ashy silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw1--6 to 16 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/3) ashy silt loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2--16 to 24 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) ashy silt loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) dry; 20 percent medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist, masses of oxidized iron on faces of peds; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

    2Cg--24 to 34 cm; dark gray (5YR 4/1) extremely channery loam, gray (5YR 6/1) dry; 20 percent medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist, masses of oxidized iron on faces of peds; massive; moderately sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 75 percent angular channers; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    2R--34 cm; hard metasedimentary rock.
