WINTONER SERIES

The Wintomer series consists of very deep soils on fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wintoner silt loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed needles, twigs and leaves.

	A--1 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3.2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

	Bt1--4 to 11 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; very few clay films in pores; few faint clay bridges between sand grains and few faint clay films on surfaces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

Bt2--11 to 29 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine prismatic structure that parts to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in pores, as clay bridges between sand grains and on surfaces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (14 to 20 inches thick)

BCt--29 to 39 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common faint clay bridges between sand grains and very few distinct clay films in pores and on surfaces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick)

C--39 to 61 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Chelan County, Washington; 1,000 feet north and 150 feet east of west quarter corner section 21, T.26N., R.17E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 30 to 40 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches. These soils are neutral or slightly acid.

The A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has moderate granular or blocky structure.

The Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chromas of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  This horizon has weak or moderate prismatic and blocky structure.  It has 30 to 40 percent clay.

The C horizon has the same color range as the B horizon, and is silt loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the McEwen, Savola and Zeniff series.  McEwen soils have 7.5YR or 5YR hue in the B horizon.  Savola soils have 5YR hue and are calcareous in the lower part of the control section.  Zeniff soils have medium textured control sections with 7.5YR hue.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are at elevations between 1,900 and 2,300 feet on nearly level to sloping old fans in the valleys near the communities of Plain and Winton.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in old alluvium of clay loam, sandy clay loam, and silt loam washed from the nearby mountains.  There is an admixture of loess and a little volcanic ash in the surface layer of these soils.  The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 69 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The average frost free season is 75 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brief, Nard, and Peoh series.  Brief soils have a mollic epipedon and have over 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Nard soils lack argillic horizons.  Peoh soils are poorly drained and have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for timber but some berries, vegetable crops, hay and pasture.  Native vegetation was Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, white fir, vineleaf maple, willow, snowberry, bluegrass, Oregon grape, rose, thimbleberries and elderberries.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Washington.  The series is of small extent.
