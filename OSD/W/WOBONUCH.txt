WOBONUCH SERIES

The Wobonuch series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Wobonuch soils are on flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1080 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wobonuch soils are on concave to linear treads of flood-plain steps. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. These soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 1520 to 2130 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 535 to 1165 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C. The frost free season is 120 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wuksachi soils. The Wuksachi soils are on flood plains and low flood plain steps and are very poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, moderately high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Occasional flooding for brief (2 to 7 days) duration beginning in April, occasional ponding for long (7 to 30 days) duration beginning in April. Seasonal high water table at 25 to 50 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is bulrush, corn lily, common cowparsnip, narrow-leaved lotus, western cowbane and whitestem hedgenettle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
