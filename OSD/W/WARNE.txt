SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: North Carolina and Virginia and possibly South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.
Extent: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Sussex County, Virginia; 2006.

REMARKS:
These soils were formerly included with the Wahee series. The central concept of the Wahee series is in the Tidewater MLRA (153B).  REVISED=9/7/2006, RLV,MC-restricted elevation to 8 to 25 to 800 feet, previously 100 to 450 feet. The July 2009 revision moves the type location from King and Queen County, VA to Rowan County, NC. This pedon better fits the central concept of the series.
The January 2026 revision changed the formatting.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A and E horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 10 to 18 centimeters (4 to 7 inches) (E horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 152 centimeters (7 to 60 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)
Endosaturation--saturation in all layers to a depth of 203 centimeters (80 inches)
