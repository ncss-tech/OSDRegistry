MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Sussex County, Virginia; 2006. 

REMARKS: 
These soils were formerly included with the Wahee series.  The central concept of the Wahee series is in the Tidewater MLRA (153B).  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 7 inches (A and E horizons) 
Albic horizon--the zone from 4 to 7 inches (E horizon) 
Argillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons) 
Endosaturation--saturation in all layers to a depth of 80 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  

MLRA = 136, 133A 

REVISED=9/7/2006, RLV,MC-restricted elevation to 25 to 800 feet, previously 100 to 450 feet.  The July 2009 revision moves the type location from King and Queen County, VA to Rowan County, NC.  This pedon better fits the central concept of the series.
