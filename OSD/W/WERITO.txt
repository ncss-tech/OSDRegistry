WERITO SERIES 

The Werito series consists of well drained, slowly permeable sodium affected soils that are moderately deep. Werito soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale and are on toeslopes below structural benches, mesas or cuestas. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Sodic Haplocambids

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Werito soils are on toeslopes below mesas, cuestas and structural benches. The upper part of the profile of Werito soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The lower part of the profile formed in weathered shale. Slope range from 1 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,000 feet (1,646 to 1,829 meters). The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F (10.0 to 12.8 degrees ). The average frost-free period is 130 to 160 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Benally, Brimhall, and Genats soils. Benally and Brimhall soils are deep, have gypsic and calcic horizons and are in a coarse-loamy family. Genats soils lack cambic horizons and occur on steeper slopes. Uffens soils are deep and have natric horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff, slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Werito soils are used for livestock grazing. Present vegetation is mound saltbush, sickle saltbush, ribscale, alkali sacaton, galleta, and Russian thistle. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Werito soils are of small extent in the western San Juan Basin portion of the Colorado Plateau in northwest New Mexico. MLRA 35; LRR-D.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shiprock Area Soil Survey, 1993. Werito is the name of a canyon in southern San Juan County 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 14 inches (Bn1 and Bn2 horizons) 
Paralithic contact - the boundary with shale bedrock at 34 inches (3Cr layer) 
The By horizon is either too thin or does not contain enough gypsum to qualify as a gypsic horizon. 
The dark colors and organic carbon of these soils is inherited from the parent materials and is non-pedogenic. This soil is too dry to meet the requirements of an Ustic intergrade. The low pH of the C horizon may be due to the presence of elemental sulfur or pyrite, also inherited from the underlying bedrock. 
Calcium carbonate equivalence determined with the use of a field volume calcimeter. Salinity values were determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Selected properties of the type location were determined by the NSSL as Pedon ID: 84NM045002
