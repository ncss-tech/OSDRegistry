WAPAHANI SERIES

The Wapahani series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow or moderately deep to dense till. The Wapahani soils formed in loamy till. They are on ground moraines and recessional moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, mesic, shallow Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Wapahani clay loam, on a 10 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 274 meters (900 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. In closely related families are the Losantville and Thrifton series. Losantville soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are in the clayey particle-size class. Thrifton soils are in the superactive cation-exchange activity class. Other closely related soils that are not in the shallow family are the Adamstown, Beech, Blakeslee, Cazenovia, El Dara, Funkstown, Hilton, Kidami, Lima, Miami, Mt. Zion, Pevely, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, Summitville, and Vaughnsville series. Adamstown, Beech, El Dara, Funkstown, Kidami, Miami, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, and Vaughnsville soils are more than 50 cm (20 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Blakeslee, Cazenovia, and Hilton soils are deeper than 46 cm (18 inches) to carbonates. Lima soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Mt. Zion and Summitville soils have sola thicker than 50 cm (20 inches). Pevely soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wapahani soils are on shoulder slopes and backslopes on ground moraines and recessional moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. The soils formed in till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1067 mm (35 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (48 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 183 to 381 meters (600 to 1,250 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Crosby, Miami, Treaty, and Williamstown soils. The somewhat poorly drained Crosby soils are moderately deep to dense till and are on higher lying summits and shoulder slopes. The Miami soils are moderately deep to dense till and are on more sloping shoulder slopes and backslopes on lower elevations. The poorly drained Treaty soils are very deep and are in depressions. The Williamstown soils are moderately deep to dense till and are on similar landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low to moderately high in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. A few areas are used for growing small grain, mainly wheat, and for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Indiana and southwest Ohio; MLRAs 111A and 111D. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Delaware County, Indiana, 1997. 

REMARKS: Wapahani soils have previously been correlated as moderately slowly permeable phases of the Strawn series and severely eroded phases of the Miami series. The central concept of the Wapahani series is that of severely eroded soils that are shallow to dense till. A new type location may be needed that does not have the densic contact at the 50 cm break.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 13 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 13 to 41 cm (Bt horizon).
Densic contact: at 50 cm (top of the Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox depletions in all horizons below a depth of 41 cm. 

A representative data mapunit for this pedon is 123781 in MO 11.
