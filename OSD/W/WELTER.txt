WELTER SERIES

The Welter series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from semi-consolidated acid shale or in colluvium derived from the shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Dystrustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Welter silty clay loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; pine cones, needles, twigs, and humus; abrupt smooth boundary.

    E--1 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 16 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to strong fine and very fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and very plastic; many coarse, medium, fine, and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; few very hard shale fragments; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--16 to 25 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and very plastic; common coarse and medium roots; many fine and very fine pores; 10 percent soft shale fragments and 5 percent hard shale fragments; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); diffuse wavy boundary. (combined Bw horizons are 14 to 32 inches thick)

    Cr--25 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) consolidated shale, dark gray (N 4/0 ) moist; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) coatings on some shale fragments.

TYPE LOCATION:  Fergus County, Montana; 2,420 feet south and 1,980 feet east of the NW corner of sec. 4, T. 15 N., R. 23 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 41 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches; dry in all parts between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F or above.

Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches.

A BC horizon is allowed.


E horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  1 or 2

Texture:  loam or silty clay loam

Clay content:  20 to 40 percent

Reaction:  pH 4.5 to 6.5


Bw1 horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  1 or 2

Texture:  silty clay or clay

Clay content:  40 to 55 percent

Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent shale fragments--0 to 10 percent soft shale; 0 to 5 percent hard shale

Reaction:  pH 3.6 to 5.5


Bw2 horizon - Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y

Value:  5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist

Chroma:  1 or 2

Texture:  silty clay or clay

Clay content:  40 to 50 percent

Rock fragments:  15 to 50 percent shale fragments--10 to 35 percent soft shale; 5 to 15 percent hard shale

Reaction:  pH 3.6 to 5.5


Cr horizon  semi-consolidated acid shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains; hills.

Elevation - 2,200 to 3,800 feet.

Slope - 4 to 45 percent.

Parent material - residuum derived from semi-consolidated acid shale or in colluvium derived from the shale.

Climate - long winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 15 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 115 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dilts, Julin and Teigen soils.  Dilts soils are shallow over shale.  Julin soils do not have an O horizon. Teigen soils do not have a paralithic contact above a depth of 60 inches and do not have O and E horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Welter soils are used mainly for grazeable woodland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass and Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Welter soils are of small extent in central Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fergus County, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0335.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (E, Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 24 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 24 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).  Welter soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
