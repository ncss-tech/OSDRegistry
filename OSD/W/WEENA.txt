WEENA SERIES

The Weena series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone. Weena soils are on hills and sideslopes of plateaus. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Weena fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 7 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent;10 percent fine gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--7 to 17 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very paragravelly fine sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few medium roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent; 40 percent paragravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 30 cm thick)

    Cr--17 cm; weathered tuff; few very fine roots in cracks; fractures greater than 10 to 45 cm apart.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada, about  1,850 feet north and 200 feet west of the southeast corner of section 5, T. 16 N.; R. 24 E.; Churchill Butte 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.279277 latitude, -119.3062777 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 10 to 36 cm to a paralithic contact.
Reaction: Neutral through strongly alkaline.  
Effervescence: Very slightly effervescent through strongly effervescent in all horizons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent. 
Rock fragments: Averages 0 to 15 percent gravel; 
Pararock fragments: Averages 35 to 70 percent paragravel.

A1 horizon - Hue: 10YR through 5Y.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist.

A2 horizon or C horizons (if present)
Texture: Silt loam or loam.
Pararock fragments: Average 35 to 70 percent. Fragments are mainly paragravel of tuff, siltstone or sandstone and typically increase with depth to the paralithic contact.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birdsley, Celeton, Goldyke, McCracken, Oceanet, Perlor, Roic, Slatery and Somorent series.  Birdsley, Goldyke, McCracken, Oceanet, Perlor, and Somorent soils have less than 35 percent parafragments in the paticle-size control section. Celeton soils have diatomite parent material. Roic and Slatery soils are moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weena soils are on hills and sideslopes of plateaus. They formed in residuum derived from Tertiary sandstone and siltstone of lacustrine origin. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,524 meters.  The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Theon and Whirlo soils. Theon soils have argillic horizons. Whirlo soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, and have cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Weena soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly Indian ricegrass, shadscale, Bailey greasewood and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRAs 26 and 27.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 17 cm (A horizons).
Paralithic contact - The boundary at 17 cm to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 17 cm (A horizons).
