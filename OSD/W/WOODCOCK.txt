ADDITIONAL DATA:
*NASIS Site ID--1989OR029001
*NASIS Pedon ID--1989OR029001

2007--type location was moved to an area where the ecological site was more representative (in Jackson County, OR, at the TUD pedon location in the OR632 soil survey area)

2010--current OSD type location (in Jackson County, OR) was visited, and based on current ecological site correlations to soil climate the series was reclassified to frigid from cryic; classification was changed from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, Arigic Pachic Cryoboralls to Medial-skeletal, amorphic, frigid, Alfic Humic Haploxerands. 

07/2017--Updated this official series description according to SSRO1 Technical Note 11, OSD--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting, with some changes to climate data..

2020--Defined this series as very deep (versus deep and very deep, as it was originally described), based on soil survey manuscripts and field documentation.
