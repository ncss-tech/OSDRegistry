WINIFRED SERIES

The Winifred series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from semiconsolidated shale or in alluvium over the deposited semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Winifred silty clay loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 14 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and many very fine roots; many very fine pores; few fine threads and masses of lime; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual irregular boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--14 to 22 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and many very fine roots; many very fine pores; common medium masses of lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--22 to 32 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine pores; common medium masses of lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick)

    Cr--32 to 60 inches; grayish brown and yellowish brown mudstone; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
