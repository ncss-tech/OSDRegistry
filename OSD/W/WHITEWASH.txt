WHITEWASH SERIES

The Whitewash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high.  These soils are on inactive floodplains and have slopes from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 737 to 813 millimeters (29 to 32 inches).
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Udifluvents
 
TYPICAL PEDON: Whitewash sand, with a slope of 1 percent on a nearly level flood plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oe--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); black (10YR 2/1) moderately decomposed plant material, weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine to coarse roots throughout; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

    C1--8 to 18 centimeters (3 to 7 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; common fine to coarse roots throughout; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

    Ab--18 to 23 centimeters (7 to 9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine to coarse roots throughout; extremely acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

    C2--23 to 41 centimeters (9 to 16 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand; massive; firm; few fine to coarse roots throughout; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

    C3--41 to 203 centimeters (16 to 80 inches); 80 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; with 20 percent strata of brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam  to 2 inches thick; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: Currently the Dinkey and Bane series compete with the Whitewash series.  Both of these series will be reclassified to the Udipsamment great group when updated to current Soil Taxonomy standards.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material--Sandy alluvial sediments 
Landform--Inactive glacial floodplains
Elevation--195 to 201 meters (640 to 660 feet) above mean sea level
Mean Annual Air Temperature--5.6 to 6.7 degrees C (42 to 44 degrees F)
Mean Annual Precipitation--737 to 813 millimeters (29 to 32 inches)
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are:
AuGres soils without loamy strata in lower landscape positions.
Croswell soils without loamy strata in slightly lower landscape positions.
Deer Park soils without loamy strata on higher or similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: Moderately high or high
Runoff: Negligible
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Whitewash soils are forested.  Primary use is forestry and secondary uses are for wildlife and recreation.  Major species include sugar maple, quaking aspen, shield fern, elderberry, and sweet cicely.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 94B (Michigan Eastern Upper Peninsula Sandy Drift). Whitewash soils are of small extent.
