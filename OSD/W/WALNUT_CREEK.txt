GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: Coarse-loamy human-transported material over alluvium
Landform: Fills, raised land, or other locally raised landforms on floodplains and stream terraces along streams
Slope: 0 to 6 percent
Elevation: 50 to 100 meters
Frost-free period: 200 to 250 days
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 13 to 17 degrees C
Mean Annual Precipitation: 1000 to 1200 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Appling, Beltline, Cecil, Chavis, Chewacla, Pacolet, Wedowee series,

Appling soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section; have few to many mica flakes throughout; found on nearby unmodified ridges and sideslopes
Beltline soils have between 25 and 50 centimeters of human-transported material; found on nearby cut and filled ridges and sideslopes 
Cecil soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section and are dominantly 5YR or redder in the argillic horizons; found on nearby unmodified ridges and sideslopes
Chavis soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section; found on nearby cut and filled ridges and steeper sideslopes
Chewacla soils have aquic conditions; found in nearby drainageways and river valleys
Pacolet soils have 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have few to common mica flakes in the argillic; found on nearby unmodified ridges and sideslopes.
Wedowee soils have 35 to 60 precent clay in the particle-size control section; found on nearby unmodified ridges and sideslopes 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Well drained
Surface runoff: Low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class: Typically moderately high except where compacted.
Ponding: None
Flooding: None

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses are for residential, commercial, and recreational applications in an urban setting. Vegetation may include managed and unmanaged plant communities with a mix of native and non-native species. Many areas are vegetated with non-native ornamental landscaping and/or turfgrass associated with developed land uses. Some areas may exhibit weedy, invasive, and/or primary succession vegetation communities (e.g., abandoned lots and other unmanaged areas). Some small patches of mixed native forest species such sycamore, river birch, ironwood, and swamp white oak may be present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Urban and other areas with human-modified landscapes in the South Atlantic and Gulf Slope Cash Crops, Forest, and Livestock Region
Major Land Resource Area; MLRA 136. These soils are of small extent.

REMARKS:
Typical Pedon Taxonomic Features:
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 13 centimeters 0 to 5 inches 
Human-transported materials--The zone from 0 to 150 centimeters 
Particle-size control section--The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters 
Taxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th edition (2022)
Other: Walnut Creek name taken from the Walnut Creek Greenway which is a large greenbelt that runs from Lake Johnson Park located in Cary, NC to southeastern Raleigh, NC. 
Other: Some pedons may have redoximorphic features below a depth of 100 centimeters in the intact native subsoil and would be included in the concept as related to the thickness of human-transported materials.

Some pedons have a thin subsurface pedogenic horizon (e.g., ^Bw horizon) in the human-transported materials that are typically too thin to qualify for a cambic horizon.
