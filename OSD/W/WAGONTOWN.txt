WAGONTOWN SERIES

The Wagontown series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils.  They formed in colluvium or alluvium from intrusive igneous rocks.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 35 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wagontown coarse sandy loam - forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0i--0 to 1 inch; Douglas-fir needles and forest litter.

    A--1 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many very fine and fine roots; 30 percent pebbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

    Bw--7 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common very fine and fine roots; 30 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    C--19 to 42 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; loose, very friable; common medium and coarse roots; 35 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

    R--42 inches; hard fractured granodiorite.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Roadcat and Yellowbay series. These soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wagontown soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 4,500 to 6,500 feet.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium from granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 35 to 70 percent. Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F; average annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 28 inches; and the frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Broad Canyon, Coski, Grousecreek, Quartzburg, and Switchback soils.  Broad Canyon, Coski, and Grousecreek soils have Mollic epipedons and occur on north and east facing slopes.  Quartzburg and Switchback soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches and occur on south and west facing slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability to the gravelly sand layer and very rapid permeability below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazed woodland.  Native vegetation is Ponderosa pine, Douglas-Fir, mountain snowberry, elksedge, and ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The southern part of the Idaho Batholith. Wagontown series is of moderate extent.
