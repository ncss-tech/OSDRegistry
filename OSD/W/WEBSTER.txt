MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Clay County, Iowa, 1916.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 16 inches (Ap and A horizon); Cambic horizon - the zone from a depth of 16 to 40 inches (BAg, Bg1, Bg2 and BCg horizons); aquic moisture regime based on low chroma colors below the mollic epipedon.

The concepts of moderately coarse and moderately fine substratum phases were established by the mlra-103 steering committee.  The Des Moines Lobe till gets sandier and contains less clay as one progresses south along the path of the Des Moines advance.
