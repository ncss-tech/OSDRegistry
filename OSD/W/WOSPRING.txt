WOSPRING SERIES

The Wospring series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in residuum from travertine. Wospring soils are on travertine terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Wospring loam, 1 percent slope, in a meadow at 1887 meters. When described on August 14, 1992 the soil was moist to 114 cm and saturated below.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oi--0 to 3 cm; live and slightly decomposed roots with about 10 percent mineral material; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

 A1--3 to 8 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2)  loam, brown (10YR 5/3)  moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 70 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

 A2--8 to 28 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to strong very fine and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons 10 to 51 cm)

 AB--28 to 64 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) very fine sandy loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 36 cm thick)

 Bg1--64 to 145 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) very fine sandy loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) moist; 15 percent very coarse and coarse distinct pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) moist iron masses throughout and 15 percent coarse white (2.5Y 8/1) moist iron depletions throughout; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; 80 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). (46 to 81 cm thick)

 Bg2--145 to 160 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) very fine sandy loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) moist; 15 percent very coarse and coarse distinct pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) moist iron masses throughout and 15 percent coarse white (2.5Y 8/1) moist iron depletions throughout; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Valleys
Landform: Travertine terraces
Elevation: 1765 to 1905 meters
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Parent material: Residuum from travertine
Mean annual air temperature: 2.2 to 4.4 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation: 400 to 500 millimeters
Frost free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Formation(T), Foundem, Lostine, Vertine(T) and Wover (T) series. Formation soils are well drained and are on adjacent travertine terraces and old drainageways. Foundem, and Lostine soils are well drained, and are on south and west-facing convex slopes on loess covered basalt plains. Vertine soils are moderately deep to cemented travertine layers, and are above Wospring soils on travertine terraces. Wover soils have a histic epipedon and are found on travertine terraces adjacent to Wospring soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Poorly drained
Runoff: Very low and low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: Moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: Nonirrigated pasture
Vegetation: Mainly shrubby cinquefoil and sedges

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho; MLRA 13. The soils are of small extent.
