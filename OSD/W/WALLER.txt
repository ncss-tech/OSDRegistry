WALLER SERIES

The Waller series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent, but are mainly less than 0.5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1351 mm (53 in).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Waller County, Texas; 1948.

REMARKS:  Based on Lincoln Soil Survey Laboratory Data of closely associated soils, the mineralogy class was changed from mixed to siliceous. See Dr. Grossman's memo dated September 14, 1972, SOILS - Harris County, Texas, in reference to the Hockley and Wockley series. Study and Thesis by M. Vepraskas (TAMU) shows E horizon is slowly permeable. The Lelavale series was established in 1998 in Hardin County, Texas to separate the very poorly drained Waller, depressional unit from the Waller series. 

Diagnostic horizons and features for this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 86 cm (0 to 34 in) (A and Eg horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 86 to 203 cm (34 to 80 in) (Btg/Eg horizon) 
Glossic horizon: 86 to 203 cm (34 to 80 in) (Btg/Eg horizon) 
Aquic moisture regime: these soils have aquic conditions from December to April in normal years.
