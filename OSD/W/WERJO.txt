RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Typically, the soil moisture control section (SMCS) is intermittently moist in some parts between November to April and July to September.  It is assumed to be dry in all parts 50 to 75 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F or more. Typic aridic moisture regime based on precipitation.

Depth to seasonal high water table - 3.5 to 5.0 feet

Soil temperature - 53 to 57 degrees F.

Other features: lenses, laminae, and thin strata of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay are present; some pedons have strata of sand, coarse sand, or gravelly coarse sand below 40 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Werjo soils are on high flood plains of perennial streams.  They formed in alluvium derived from Cretaceous and Tertiary sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevation is 4,700 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is arid.  Average annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches and average annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bebeevar, Green River, Walrees, and Werlog soils.  Bebeevar soils are sandy and lack aquic conditions within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Green River soils are coarse-loamy and lack aquic conditions within 40 inches.  Walrees soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have an Ustic soil moisture regime, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Werlog soils are fine-loamy, have seasonal high water tables at 2 to 3.5 feet, and have aquic conditions higher in the profile.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  These soils have only a rare hazard of overbank flooding from the adjacent stream due to water flow control by a large upstream dam.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Werjo soils are used for livestock grazing, irrigated crops and pasture, and urban development.  The present vegetation on the uncropped, saline phase is inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, black greasewood, New Mexico olive, fourwing saltbush, and threadleaf rubber rabbitbrush.  Common crops on the irrigated phase are alfalfa for hay, corn, apples, cantaloupes, and grasses and legumes for pasture.  The natural (nonirrigated) phase of Werjo is strongly saline, while the irrigated phase is only slightly saline due to leaching by irrigation waters which has reduced the content of soluble sodium salts.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Werjo soils are of small extent in the San Juan River valley portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico.  MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  San Juan County, New Mexico, Shiprock Area Soil Survey, 1993.  Werjo is a coined name.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 4 inches.  (A horizon)

Entisol feature - The lack of diagnostic subsurface horizons due to young soil age

Fluventic feature - Alluvial stratification and an irregular organic carbon distribution

Aquic subgroup - Aquic conditions and redox depletions within 40 inches of the soil surface (C3 and C4 horizons)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

Note:  More acres of this series may exist in the adjacent survey area of San Juan County, New Mexico, Eastern Part.  In that published soil survey, the Werlog series was mapped with a depth to seasonal high water table of 2 to 5 feet.  Those pedons of Werlog with water tables between 3.5 and 5 feet should be within the range of this Werjo series.
