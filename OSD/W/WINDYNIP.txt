WINDYNIP SERIES

The Windynip series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Windynip soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Humixerepts

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice. The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 15 to 16 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 6 degrees or greater. The soils have a thermic soil temperature regime.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Windynip soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex positions on predominantly southeast to southwest-facing ridges and slopes. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1000 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wirefence (CA) and Devilshole (CA) soils. Wirefence soils have 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle size control section. Devilshole soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and have fractured bedrock between 100 and 150 centimeters. Wirefence soils are on linear positions on summits and backslopes. Devilshole soils are on convex summits and shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation is annual and perennial grasses and forbs. Douglas-fir invades readily in the absence of fire and grazing.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
