WOODS CROSS SERIES

The Woods Cross series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lake sediments derived from gneiss, schist, granite, quartzite and sandstone.  These soils are on smooth to slightly undulating, nearly level to gently sloping, broad alluvial fans and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F (9 degrees C), and the average annual precipitation is about 15 inches (380 mm).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Woods Cross silty clay loam - cultivated. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, plastic; many medium and fine roots; many medium and fine pores; slightly calcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) thick)

    A--6 to 37 inches (15 to 94 cm); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; weak medium, subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; many medium and fine roots; many medium and fine pores; slightly calcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 40 inches (38 to 102 cm) thick)

    Cg--37 to 72 inches (94 to 183 cm); light gray (5Y 7/1) silty clay, gray (5Y 5/1) moist; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; noncalcareous, slightly alkaline (pH 7.7).

TYPE LOCATION: Davis County, Utah; 1,000 feet south and 300 feet east of the north 1/4 corner of Sec. 25, T. 2 N., R. 1W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: A layer of peat 1 1/2 to 3 inches (4 to 8 cm) thick is at the surface in many places.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to neutral and the soil is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous. Texture of the 10 to 40 inch (25 to 100 cm) control section is silty clay or heavy silty clay loam. The soil is saturated at 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm), unless drained.

The A horizon has hues of 10YR and 2.5Y, values of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 1 or less. Distinct redoximorphic concentrations are within 30 inches (60 cm) of the surface. The A horizon contains 4 to 10 percent organic matter.

The C horizon has hues of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 through 7 dry, and 2 through 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or less. Texture is dominantly silty clay or silty clay loam, but the horizon contains thin lenses of coarser material ln some places. Buried A horizons are common.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Woods Cross soils are on smooth to slightly undulating, nearly level to gently sloping, broad alluvial fans and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils have formed in alluvium and lake sediments derived from gneiss, schist, granite, quartzite and sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F (7 to 11 degrees C), the average summer temperature from 65 to 73 degrees F (18 to 23 degrees C), and the frost-free season from 120 to 175 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches (355 to 460 mm).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Woods Cross soils are in the same general area as the Airport, Draper, Ironton, and Logan soils. Airport soils have natric horizons and their mollic epipedons are less than 24 inches (60 cm) thick. Ironton soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches (40 cm) thick, are calcareous throughout, and are in a coarse loamy family. Draper soils are in a fine-loamy family. Logan soils have a calcic horizon and are in a fine-silty family.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Runoff is slow or very slow, and permeability is slow or very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Largely used for meadow hay and pasture. Some areas have been drained and are used for general crops under irrigation. The native vegetation is mostly wiregrass, sedges and saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Woods Cross soils are mainly in north central Utah. They are of small extent. MLRA 28A.
