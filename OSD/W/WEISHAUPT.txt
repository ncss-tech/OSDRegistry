WEISHAUPT SERIES

The Weishaupt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Weishaupt soils are on flood plains on deltas.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Churchill County, Nevada; about one mile north of Stillwater on the M. Weishaupt ranch; approximately 1,400 feet west and 1,300 feet south of the east quarter corner of section 6, T. 19 N., R. 31 E.; USGS Stillwater 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 32 minutes 15.71 seconds N. and longitude 118 degrees 32 minutes 34.51 seconds W.; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5376972 latitude, -118.5429194 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weishaupt soils are on smooth flood plains on deltas.  They formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 1158 to 1219 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., the mean January temperature is -1 to 0 degrees C., and the mean July temperature is 21 to 22 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carson and Stillwater soils.  Carson soils are very-fine and higher shrink-swell properties.  Stillwater soils are fine textured and have thinner mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained in most areas where diversion of water for irrigation and artificial drainage have altered the drainage; very slow permeability (low saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 3 and 5 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) between March and July.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Weishaupt soils are irrigated and cultivated.  The principal crops are small grains, sugar beets, alfalfa, and pasture.  The native vegetation in rangeland is black greasewood and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 2,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 99 cm (Ap, A, Ak1, Ak2, 2Byzgb1, and 2Byzgb2 horizons).

Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 28 to 58 cm (Ak1 and Ak2 horizons).

Major lithologic discontinuity - The change to clayey material at 58 cm (2Byzgb1 horizon).

Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 91 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the 2Byzgb2 and 2Cyzg horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Ak1, Ak2, and 2Byzgb2 horizons and parts of the A and 2Cyzg horizons)


The revision of May 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy over clayey, mixed over smectitic, superactive, calcareous, mesic Cumulic Endoaquolls based on clay mineralogy and linear extensibility values in the NASIS database.
