WHITEPINE SERIES 

The Whitepine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that have a high component of volcanic ash in the surface layers and formed in glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Vitrandic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Whitepine ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A--1 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) ashy silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium and common coarse roots; volcanic ash component; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick) 

    E--2 to 9 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) ashy silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium and common coarse roots; volcanic ash component; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick) 

    E/Bt--9 to 15 inches; E part (60 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist, Bt part (40 percent) is light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; commom medium and coarse roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 16 inches thick) 

    Bt/E--15 to 29 inches; Bt part (80 percent) is light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist, E part (20 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common medium and coarse roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick) 

    C--29 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; 1/16 to 1/2 inch thick varves of startified silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few medium and coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Whitepine soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, cropland, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and grand fir.  Understory vegetation is mainly common snowberry, oregon grape, ninebark, brackenfern, and other forbs, shrubs, and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Whitepine soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.
