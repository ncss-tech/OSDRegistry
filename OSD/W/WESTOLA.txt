WESTOLA SERIES

The Westola series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, recent alluvium.  These soils occur on nearly level flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Westola fine sandy loam, cultivated.
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; few fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. Thickness is 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in)

     A--18 to 28 cm (7 to 11 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; few fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. Thickness is 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in)

     C1--28 to 102 cm (11 to 40 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; few fine roots; common distinct strata of loamy fine sand and fine sand 3 to 13mm thick, common distinct strata of dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) loam and fine sandy loam 1 to 2mm thick; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. Thickness is 0 to 122 cm (0 to 48 in)

     C2--102 to 203 (40 to 80 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common distinct strata of yellowish red (5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam and dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silt loam 1 to 2mm thick; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Woods County, Oklahoma; about 2 miles east and 1 mile south of Freedom, Oklahoma; about 450 feet north and 2100 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 6, T. 26 N., R. 17 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil Moisture: Typic-ustic soil moisture regime

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
   Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
   Sand content: more than 15 percent that is fine sand or coarser

A Horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 6
Other feature: Where the A horizon has value of 5.5 or less, chroma of 3.5 or less, and thickness is more than 10 inches, the organic matter content is less than 1 percent
Texture: dominantly fine sandy loam, but may be loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand
Effervescence: slight to strong
Reaction (pH): slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline (7.4-8.4)

AC Horizon (where present)
Some pedons have an AC horizon that has color, texture, and reaction similar to the A horizon. These occur on rarely flooded areas which have less overflow and are stable for longer periods.

C Horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 7; Strata of clean sand may have dry value of 7 or 8
Chroma: 3 to 8
Texture: fine sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam; thin strata up to 10cm (4 in) thick are common with texture ranging from sand to clay loam and some pedons may have textures of loamy fine sand or coarser below 102 cm (40 in)
Effervescence: strong
Reaction (pH): moderately alkaline (7.9-8.4)

Some pedons have buried horizons below 102 cm (40 in).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Colorado, Lincoln, Santo, Yahola, and Yomont series.  
Colorado soils: have a fine-loamy particle-size control section
Lincoln soils: have a sandy particle-size control section
Santo soils: occur in a moister climate and have an active clay activity class and C horizons that have hue of 10YR
Yahola soils: have a udic-ustic soil moisture regime
Yomont soils: have a coarse-silty particle-size control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous loamy alluvium
Landscape: Dissected plains and Alluvial plains
Landform: flood plains that drain Permian and Pleistocene age sediments
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 533 to 813 mm (21 to 32 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 32 to 44
Mean annual air temperature: 13.9 to 18.3 degrees C (57 to 65 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 185 to 230 days
Elevation: 304.8 to 823.0 m (1000 to 2700 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clairemont, Gracemont, Gracemore, Lincoln, Spur, and Wheatwood series.  
Clairemont and Wheatwood soils: occur on similar areas and have a fine-silty particle-size control section
Gracemont and Gracemore soils: occur on lower areas and have a water table within 6 feet of the surface
Lincoln soils: occur on similar areas and have a sandy particle-size control section.
Spur soils: occur on similar to slightly higher positions, have a fine-loamy particle-size control section, and a mollic epipedon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is negligible. These soils are frequently to rarely flooded for very brief to brief periods during April to October.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mainly cropped to alfalfa, cotton, small grains, forage sorghum, and tame pasture. The native vegetation is tall and mid grasses with Eastern Cottonwood, Tamarisk, and American Elm.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA-78B, 78C) of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas.  The series is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

REMARKS: Westola soils were formerly mapped as Yahola.

Edited 11/2015 (RFG-ROG): Changed to tabular format. Added metric measurements. Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.
