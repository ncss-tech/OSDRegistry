WELLS SERIES

The Wells series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from noncalcareous sandstones and sandy shales modified by thin deposits of colluvium from sandstone and loess.  Wells soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 41 to 91 cm (16 to 36 inches). (upper 50 cm of Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 41 centimeters (0 to 16 inches). (A, BA horizons)

The assignment of the CEC activity class is supported by KSSL sample number 79P0320 (pedon 79KS143001).

In some pedons, sandstone or sandy shale bedrock occurs at depths between 100 and 150 cm. 

07/2003 WAW CEC activity class added, change format to semi-tablular, updated competing series, added ADDITIONAL DATA, updated reaction classes in horizon description to new terminology. 

Modified format by LRM in 2/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

8/2013 DJK Added landform to introduction and geomorphic setting.  Updated climate information.  Added elevation to typical pedon. Added clay content, sand content, and rock fragments in RIC. Added BA ranges. Added chroma of 8 to range for Bt.  Changed color values and added calcium carbonate equivalent (deleted concretions) for C. Added elevation, precipitation pattern, and frost free days to geomorphic setting. Deleted thornwaite PE index. Updated geographically associated soils. Added LRR and MLRA to Distribution and Extent. Added statement on depth to bedrock in remarks section. Added sample number that supports CEC activity class. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
A pedon was sampled from the same general area as the typical pedon.  KSSL lab pedon no. 79P0320 (pedon 79KS143001).
