REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters; series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and properties recognized in this pedon are:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 71 and the zone from a depth of 99 to 203 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, BC1, and BC2 horizons);
calcic horizon--the zone from 71 to 99 centimeters (Bk horizon);
udic moisture regime.
 
Some pedons have a sandy or coarse-loamy lag line about 10 centimeters thick with or without gravel at the base of the solum.

These soils were previously identified as Wilmonton soils on the Coteau des Prairies "bench" geomorphic landform.

The differentia between Walnut Grove and Wilmonton series needs further study.

The BC horizon is defined by having prismatic primary structure parting to angular or subangular blocky.  This structure is evident in pits and cutbanks and rarely observed by by smaller scale investigations. The change in moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.65 g/cc was based on some lab data of similar soils and field investigations by soil scientists on this geomorphic landform.

Based on current investigations, elevation ranges in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meters above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296, has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
