WALLULA SERIES

The Wallula series consists of deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in residuum weathered from fine grained sandstone over noncalcareous silty shale. These soils are on side slopes of uplands. Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F)

The Martin soils are on lower landscape positions and have a clayey argillic horizon. 
The Rosendale soils are found on similar slopes and have more clay in the profile.
