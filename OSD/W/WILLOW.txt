WILLOW SERIES

The Willow series consists of deep, well drained, moderately to moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium or pedisediments over sandstone bedrock of Permian age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on plain terraces and footslopes and toeslopes of pediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in), and mean annual temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F).
