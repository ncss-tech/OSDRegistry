WINEGAR SERIES

The Winegar series consists of moderately well drained soils on ground moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in glacial till derived from mixed volcanic bedrock.  They are influenced by loess and volcanic ash. Winegar soils are moderately deep to dense basal till.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, amorphic Typic Vitricryands

USE AND VEGETATION:  Winegar soils are used for wildlife habitat, recreation and woodland.  These soils commonly support lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry, lodgepole pine/pinegrass, and lodgepole pine/blue huckleberry community types.  The potential native vegetation is a subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry plant association, pinegrass phase or subalpine fir/blue huckleberry plant association, grouse whortleberry phase. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Winegar soils are moderately extensive in northwestern Wyoming and southeastern Idaho; MLRA 43B
