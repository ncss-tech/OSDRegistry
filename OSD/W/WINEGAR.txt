WINEGAR SERIES 

The Winegar series consists of moderately well drained soils on ground moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in glacial till derived from mixed volcanic bedrock.  They are influenced by loess and volcanic ash. Winegar soils are moderately deep to dense basal till.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 35 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, amorphic Typic Vitricryands

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belrick, and Linksterly series.  Belrick soils have 75 to 85 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregates in the minerology control section.  Lindsterly soils hae umbric epipedons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winegar soils are on undulating to rolling ground moraines.  Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in glacial till derived from mixed volcanic rock.  There is some loess and volcanic ash influence in the upper part.  Surface and subsoil layers of these soils are lightly reworked by colluvial or alluvial action.  Substratums are dense basal till.  Elevations range from 6200 to 9900 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches being well-distributed throughout the year.  Average annual temperature is 32 to 39 degrees F. The frost free period is 5 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the tentative Bradco soils. Bradco soils are found intermixed with Winegar soils.  They have umbric epipedons and are well drained. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Winegar soils are used for wildlife habitat, recreation and woodland.  These soils commonly support lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry, lodgepole pine/pinegrass, and lodgepole pine/blue huckleberry community types.  The potential native vegetation is a subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry plant association, pinegrass phase or subalpine fir/blue huckleberry plant association, grouse whortleberry phase. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Wyoming and southeastern Idaho. The soil of this series are of moderate extent.
