WINWELL SERIES

The Winwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lake terraces that formed in lacustrine sediments with some alluvial influence.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Winwell silty clay loam on a 2 percent slope in cropland.  When described on August 27, 1990, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 3 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine and few medium tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Ap2--3 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Ap horizons is 8 to 12 inches)

    Bt1--10 to 15 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common fine distinct clay films on faces of peds; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--15 to 22 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; many fine prominent clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 12 to 18 inches)

    Btk--22 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; many fine distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; violently effervescent (9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk--30 to 51 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silty clay loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (38 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); common fine irregularly shaped soft lime masses and seams; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (12 to 25 inches thick).

    C--51 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (26 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); few fine irregularly shaped soft lime filaments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

COMPETING SERIES:
Opnish (WA) soils have an irrigation induced water table at 18 to 42 inches and an extremely gravelly 2B horizon at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winwell soils are on lake terraces.  They formed in lacustrine sediments with some alluvial influence.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 4,500 to 5,100 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost free period is 115 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Collinston, Parleys, and Wheelon series.  Collinston soils are calcareous throughout the profile and contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Parleys soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Wheelon soils are calcareous throughout the profile and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Collinston soils are on similar to slightly convex landscape positions as compared to Winwell soils.  Parleys soils are on low lake terraces as compared to Winwell soils.  Wheelon soils are on convex high lake terraces as compared to Winwell soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland. Crops are small grains and alfalfa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 22 inches (Ap1, Ap2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 30 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bk horizon)

Calcic horizon - The zone from 30 to 51 inches (Bk horizon)

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 30 inches (the Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons)

Classification is based on "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998".  Superactive cation exchange activity class is estimated based on CEC-7 and clay data in NASIS.
