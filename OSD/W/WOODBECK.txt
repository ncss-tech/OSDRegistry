WOODBECK SERIES

The Woodbeck series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey deposits overlying sands on ground moraines and recessional moraines and the margins of outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, mesic Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Woodbeck silt loam, on a south-facing, convex, 5 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 B/E--30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam (Bt); moderate medium angular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam (E) occurring as interfingers on faces of peds; neutral; clear irregular boundary. [10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) thick]

[Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 56 cm (10 to 22 inches) thick.]

 2E--91 to 135 cm (36 to 53 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 2Bt--135 to 145 cm (53 to 57 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 13 cm (5 inches) thick]

 2C--145 to 152 cm (57 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Woodbeck soils are on ground moraines and recessional moraines and the margins of outwash plains and lake plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Woodbeck soils formed in a thin layer of clayey till or glaciofluvial deposits overlying outwash or lake deposited sands. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The moderately well drained Perrinton soils are commonly nearby at higher elevations. Spinks, Oshtemo, and the excessively drained Oakville soils are on nearby outwash plains. These soils do not have the upper clayey horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high depending upon slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the clayey part and high or very high in the sandy part. Permeability is moderately slow in the clayey part of the profile and rapid in the underlying sand.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Woodbeck soils are cultivated. The principal crops grown are corn, hay, and small grain. A few areas are in apple orchards. Steeper areas are in permanent pasture, woodland or remain idle. Native vegetation is sugar maple, beech, and eastern white pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 97 and 98 in southern Michigan. The series is of small extent.
