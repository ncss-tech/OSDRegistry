WINKLER SERIES

The Winkler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from argillite, quartzite and breccia tuff. These soils are on mountains, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 8 to 85 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Winkler very gravelly sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

    A--2 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine pores; 40 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    E1--5 to 10 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many fine pores; 40 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

    E2--10 to 27 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 45 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the E horizon is 8 to 30 inches)

    E and Bt--27 to 44 inches; E part (75 percent) is pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; B part (25 percent) is reddish gray (5YR 5/2) fine sandy loam lamellae 1/8- to 1/2-inch thick, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 20 percent angular cobbles and 50 percent angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 40 inches thick)

    C--44 to 60 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 20 percent angular cobbles and 55 percent angular gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6).
