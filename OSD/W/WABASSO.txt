WABASSO SERIES

The Wabasso series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained, that formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments. Wabasso soils are on flatwoods, low broad flats, sloughs, depressions, and flood plains. Slopes are linear to concave and range from 0 to 2 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Alfic Alaquods

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas of Wabasso soils are in natural vegetation and used for native range. Areas with adequate water control measures are used for citrus, truck crops, and tame pasture. The natural vegetation consists of longleaf pine, slash pine, cabbage palm, live oak, with an understory of sawpalmetto, laurel oak, waxmyrtle, chalky bluestem, creeping bluestem, indiangrass, little bluestem, Florida paspalum, running oak, south Florida slash pine and pineland threeawn.
