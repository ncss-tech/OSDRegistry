WHISKEYLOG SERIES

The Whiskeylog series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rock. The Whiskeylog soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Whiskeylog soils are on linear to convex backslopes of mountain slopes. Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from metasedimentary and metavolcanics rock. Elevation is 900 to 1940 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 730 to 1030 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 160 to 245 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colonymill, Kaweah, and Ladybug soils. The Colonymill soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes and have a mollic epipedon. The Kaweah soils are on concave to linear drainages on mountain slopes and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. The Ladybug soils are on shoulders of mountain slopes and are 100 to 150 cm to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is black oak, canyon line oak, incense cedar, poison oak, alderleaf mountain mahogany, and annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
