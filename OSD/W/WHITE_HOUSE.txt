WHITE HOUSE SERIES

The White House series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources.  White House soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: White House gravelly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Bk1--39 to 49 inches; mixed yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and pink (5YR 7/4) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine tubular and irregular pores; 10 percent medium and coarse gravel; few fine and medium calcium carbonate masses; 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk2--49 to 60 inches; mixed yellowish red (5YR 5/8) and pink (5YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine irregular pores; 35 percent medium and coarse gravel; few fine calcium carbonate masses; 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Antbed (T) (TX) series. Antbed soils are on alluvial flats and have less than 30 percent sand and 0 to 5 percent gravel throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: White House soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevations range from 2,990 to 5,540 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Forrest and Bernardino soils.  In addition is the Caralampi soil.  Caralampi soils are loamy-skeletal.  Forrest and Bernardino soils have calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; slow or very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: White House soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  A few areas are used for homesites and other urban uses.  Present vegetation is grama grasses, plains lovegrass, wolftail, curly mesquite, tobosa, and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona and New Mexico.  This series is extensive.  MLRAs are 38 and 41.
