WETPARK SERIES  

The Wetpark series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils occur on structural benches and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Wetpark silty clay loam, in a wet meadow on a 6 percent slope at an elevation of 2115 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oa--0 to 9 cm; muck; highly decomposed organic materials; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 12 cm thick)

 Ag--9 to 37 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

 Bg1--37 to 57 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) very cobbly silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strong medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bg2--57 to 85 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly silty clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strong medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bg horizons - 25 to 50 cm)

 Cg--85 to 152 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
