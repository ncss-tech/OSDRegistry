WHITEFACE SERIES

The Whiteface series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite and basalt.  Whiteface soils are on glacial outwash terraces and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, shallow Argic Duricryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Whiteface cobbly loam, tree plantation.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 8 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

 AB--8 to 12 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate very fine and fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

 2Bt--12 to 16 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate very fine and fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; common thin clay films on ped faces and in pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

 2Bqm--16 to 23 inches; indurated gravelly duripan.

TYPE LOCATION:  Klamath County, Oregon; north of Aspen Lake, approximately 500 feet east and 1,550 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 21, T. 37 S., R. 7 E., W.M.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTIC:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean
annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F and is 44 to 47 degrees F when an O horizon is present.  Depth to a indurated hardpan is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  It is moderately acid to slightly acid.  The moist bulk density is 1.00 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter in the soil material above the duripan.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

The 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whiteface soils are on glacial outwash terraces at elevations of 4,000 to 4,500 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from andesite and basalt.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 100 days.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aspenlake, Woodcock, and Pokegema soils.  Aspenlake soils are over 20 inches to a indurated pan.  Woodcock soils are loamy-skeletal and over 60 inches deep.  The Pokegema soils are fine, halloysitic and are 40 to 60 inches deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability above the duripan and very slow within the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production and livestock grazing.  Native vegetation includes an overstory of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, and incense cedar.  Understory includes prostrate ceanothus, Idaho fescue, western fescue, and Ross sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
