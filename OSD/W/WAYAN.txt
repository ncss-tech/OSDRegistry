WAYAN SERIES

The Wayan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced colluvium over residuum weathered from sedimentary rock. Wayan soils are on mountain slopes, swales and interfluves on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Typic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wayan silt loam, on a north facing, 12 percent slope in sagebrush at an elevation of 2,040 meters. When described on July 8, 2011 the soil was dry from 0 to 12 cm and moist below. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 12 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, very fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular and fine vesicular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary

 A2--12 to 29 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine vesicular and fine tubular pores; 1 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons -- 25 to 31 cm)

 Bt1--29 to 46 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine vesicular, and fine and medium tubular pores; 15 percent clay films on all faces of peds; 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 49 cm thick)

 Bt2--46 to 61 cm; 75 percent reddish brown (5YR 5/4) and 25 percent brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, 50 percent reddish brown (5YR 4/3), 25 percent dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) and 25 percent brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine vesicular and few very fine tubular pores; 25 percent clay films on all faces of peds; 1 percent fine manganese masses; 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 38 cm thick)

 Bt3--61 to 80 cm; 80 percent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and 20 percent brown (7.5YR 5/3) clay, 80 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and 20 percent brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; 35 percent clay films on all faces of peds; 1 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 19 cm thick)

 Cr--80 to 150 cm; paralithic bedrock
