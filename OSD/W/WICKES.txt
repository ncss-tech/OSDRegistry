WICKES SERIES 

The Wickes series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium over residuum derived from hard fine grained sedimentary or fine grained igneous rock. These soils are on eroded fan remnants, escarpments, ridges, hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Wickes very gravelly loam, stony, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 20 cm inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 25 cm thick) 

    Bt1--20 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common distinct brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--38 to 61 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) very cobbly loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; few faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1 & Bt2 horizons - 20 to 48 cm) 

    Bk--61 to 76 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) extremely cobbly loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; common fine masses of calcium carbonate, common distinct calcium carbonate coatings on fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6). (15 to 45 cm thick) 

    R--76 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) hard fine grained igneous bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Wickes soils are primarily used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, and Rocky Mountain juniper.  Areas in woodland have an overstory of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of Idaho fescue, rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Rocky Mountain juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Wickes soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44A and 46.
