WOROCK SERIES

The Worock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, till, or slide deposits derived from igneous, argillite, and metamorphic rock. These soils are on mountains, alluvial fans, stream terraces, moraines or landslides. Slopes are 4 to 85 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Eutric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Worock stony loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter.

    E--2 to 18 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) stony loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 50 cm thick)

    E/Bt--18 to 46 cm; E part (85 percent) very pale brown (10YR 7/4), Bt part (15 percent) yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist for both parts; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 75 cm thick)

    Bt--46 to 71 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 125 cm thick)

    BC--71 to 160 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.6). (0 to 90 cm thick)
