WINDOWPEAK SERIES

The Windowpeak series consists of very deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and/or till derived from granite and granodiorite. Windowpeak soils are on moraines, mountain slopes, and glacial-valley walls and floors in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1095 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Doncecil (T), Kanawyer (T), Pajo, and Tripod soils. Doncecil soils formed in colluvium on mountain slopes and have umbric epipedons less than 50 cm thick. Kanawyer soils formed in till and colluvium on moraines and mountain slopes, have umbric epipedons less than 50 cm thick, and have a densic contact between 100 and 150 cm from the mineral soil surface. Pajo soils are 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact. Tripod soils have ashy textures in the A horizon, and have hues 10YR or yellower throughout the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Windowpeak soils are on linear backslopes and footslopes on mountain slopes, glacial-valley walls, colluvial aprons on glacial-valley floors and cirques, and moraines on plateaus. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and till derived from granite and granodiorite, and less commonly, metamorphic rocks. Elevation is 1825 to 3235 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 445 to 1515 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 2 to 10 degrees C. The frost free season is 60 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beetlerock and Hockett soils. Beetlerock soils average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on linear to convex backslopes of mountain slopes. Hockett soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact and are on linear to concave backslopes of structural benches and mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well or somewhat excessively drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is red fir, white fir, Sierra lodgepole pine, and Jeffrey pine, with an understory of chinquapin and whitethorn ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of moderate extent.
