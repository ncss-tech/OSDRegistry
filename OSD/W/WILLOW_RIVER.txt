COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chenega, Hollow, Kidazqeni, Malmesbury, Stratify, Togiak, and Shovelcreek (AK) series.
Chenega soils have a mean annual precipitation of 1150 to 2550 mm (45 to 100 in), are somewhat excessively drained, and occur on flood plains, stream terraces, and alluvial fans.
Hollow soils are calcareous in the control section, are somewhat poorly drained and frequently flooded, and occur on flood plains and outwash plains.
Kidazqeni soils have a thin mantle of stratified loamy and sandy alluvium at depths between 2 to 8 cm (1 to 3 in), are moderately well or well drained, and occur on flood plains, stream terraces, and alluvial fans.
Malmesbury soils have buried O horizons, a mean annual air temperature of 7 degrees C. (45 degrees F.), and occur on flood plains and stream terraces.
Stratify soils have very gravelly sand stratified with thin lenses of silt loam and fine sandy loam in the substratum, substantial mica content in the profile, are moderately well drained, and occur on flood plains and low terraces.
Togiak soils have a mean annual precipitation of about 760 mm (30 in), are somewhat excessively drained, and occur on beach berms of shore complexes.
Shovelcreek soils do not have buried horizons and occur on rarely flooded flood plains.
