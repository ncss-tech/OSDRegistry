WAHGUYHE SERIES

The Wahguyhe series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic flowrock and tuff.  The Wahguyhe soils are on mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Lithic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wahguyhe very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  About 60 percent of the soil surface is covered with gravel and 2 percent with cobbles.

    A--0 to 5 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine vesicular pores; 36 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 20 cm thick)

    C--5 to 41 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (28 to 38 cm thick)

    R--41 cm; rhyolite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada approximately 20 miles northwest of the town of Beatty; about 1,600 feet north and 2,000 feet east of the projected southwest corner of section 20, T. 10 S., R. 43 E. USGS Bonnie Claire SW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 03 minutes 0 seconds N and 117 degrees 9 minutes 41 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.0500000 latitude, -117.1613889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring months, dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to lithic contact:  36 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Percent clay:  5 to 15 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent. Mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.

C horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Structure: Subangular blocky, platy or is massive.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Jobpeak, Lequieu, Medved, Mizel, Skedaddle, Snaker, and Tejabe series.  

Jobpeak, Mizel, Skedaddle, and Tejabe soils are less than 36 cm deep to bedrock.  Lequieu, Medved and Saker soils contain more than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wahguyhe soils are on mountain slopes and hills.  These soils formed in mostly residuum with some colluvium derived from volcanic flowrock and tuffs.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 2,505 meters.  The climate is arid with hot summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Caya soils.  The Caya soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, ephedra, and spiny menodora.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 29, 30.
