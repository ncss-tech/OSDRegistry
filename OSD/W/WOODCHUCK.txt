WOODCHUCK SERIES

The Woodchuck series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on fan remnants and eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Entic Durustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Woodchuck loam, in irrigated hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 38 cm thick) 

    Bk1--20 to 36 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated carbonates and common fine carbonate masses; many distinct carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    Bk2--36 to 81 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; 10 percent cobbles; finely disseminated carbonates and common fine carbonate masses; many distinct carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 61 cm thick)

    Bk3--81 to 97 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very cobbly sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; 15 percent cobbles; finely disseminated carbonates and common fine carbonate masses; many distinct carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

    2Bkqm--97 to 132 cm; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) dry and pink (7.5YR 7/3) moist; indurated silica-calcium carbonate cemented duripan; extremely hard; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 61 cm thick)

    3C--132 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 45 percent gravel; 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
