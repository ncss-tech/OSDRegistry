WAPITI SERIES

The Wapiti series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from mixed sources.  Wapiti soils are on plains, interfluves, drainageways, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F.)

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County Soil Survey Area, 2007.  The name Wapiti (Wa-pee-tee) is coined from a Native American word for elk.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: 0 to 200 centimeters
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 15 to 65 centimeters (6 to 26 inches).  (Bt horizon and part of the Btk horizon)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 36 centimeters (0 to 14 inches).  (A and Bt horizon)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 15 to 69 centimeters (6 to 27 inches). (Bt and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 69 to 97 centimeters (27 to 38 inches).  (Bk1 horizon)

This soil was originally included in the Wages series.  A consistent calcic horizon was found above a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches), resulting the development of a new series.  

This update converts English to metric and updates the competing series section and the location to NAD 83.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
