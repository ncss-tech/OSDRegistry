WUBY SERIES

The Wuby series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone.  Wuby soils are on canyon walls and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 40 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 48 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wuby very cobbly fine sandy loam, on a north-northwest facing, convex, 52 percent slope in woodland at an elevation of 2393 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 25, 1991 the soil was slightly moist from 1 to 49 cm.  The surface is covered by 8 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the very deep Datino, Longabaugh and Northorn series.  The Datino soils formed in calcareous sandstone and shale and have cambic and calcic horizons. Longabaugh and Northorn soils have a cryic temperature regime and are on north aspects under denser stands of Douglas-fir and aspen.  The Longabaugh soils have horizons with secondary carbonate accumulation.  The Northorn soils have an argillic horizon and a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Existing vegetation consists of scattered Douglas-fir, Rocky Mountain juniper, Utah serviceberry, Pinyon pine, mountain mahogany, snowberry, Salina wildrye, slender wheatgrass and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of central Utah, Southern Rocky Mountains; LRR E, MLRA 48A; small extent; about 2,600 hectares (6,600 acres) mapped in Carbon, Emery and Sevier Counties, Utah.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 1 to 49 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 26 to 49 cm.  (part of Bw and entire C horizon)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 1 to 38 cm.  (A and Bw horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with quartzite at 49 cm.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
