WALFORD SERIES

The Walford series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves or ridgetops on dissected till plains and treads and risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 56 to 106 centimeters (22 to 42 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons);

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 38 centimeters (15 inches) (Ap, E1, and E2 horizons);

The differentiae of the Coppock and Cory series to Walford series needs further study.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
