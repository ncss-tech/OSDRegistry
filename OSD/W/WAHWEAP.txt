WAHWEAP SERIES

The Wahweap series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian sands and sandstone alluvium on rolling plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 16 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Wahweap fine sand - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bk1--1 to 12 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) gravelly loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel with thicker lime coatings on the bottom than on the top; slightly effervescent, 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk2--12 to 19 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 60 percent gravel with thicker lime coatings on the bottom than on the top; violently effervescent, 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    2Cr--19 inches; pinkish white (5YR 8/2) partially weathered sandstone; lime coatings in joints.

Soil temperature - 57 to 59 degrees F.

Rock fragments - 35 to 60 percent gravel in the control section

Organic matter content - Less than 1 percent

A and B horizons
Hue:  7.5YR, 5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  6 or 8 dry
Texture:  Fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, averaging finer than loamy fine sand

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wahweap soils are on rolling plateaus.  These soils formed in eolian sands and sandstone alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 16 percent.  Elevations range from 3600 to 4400 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 55 to 57 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 160 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pagina and Sheppard series.  Pagina soils are moderately deep.  Sheppard soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is mainly blackbrush, Mormon-tea, broom snakeweed, Indian ricegrass, and annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  The Wahweap series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
