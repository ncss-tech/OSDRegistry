WALKUP SERIES

The Walkup series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale and quartzite rocks.  Walkup soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Walkup sandy loam, on a south facing 1 percent slope under pasture grasses at an elevation of 5,940 feet.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, common medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    C2--19 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (11 to 24 inches thick)

    C3--36 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; many fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; one mile north northwest of Merkley Park; located about 1,500 feet east and 1,400 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 19, T.3S., R.21E. SLBM; USGS Steinaker Reservoir, Utah quadrangle; 40 degrees, 32 minutes, 23 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 36 minutes, 34 seconds west longitude; NAD 027.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year, with a slight increase in late summer and fall.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.
Depth to redox concentrations: 2 to 28 inches
Depth to endosaturation:  40 to 60 inches to irrigation induced saturation during the months of April to December

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 5 to 18 percent clay, 0 to 14 percent subrounded rock fragments

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 5 dry or moist
Texture: dominantly sandy loam with some pedons being stratified loamy sand to loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 4 to 15 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  A current competitor is the Sugun series.  A competitor prior to the Seventh Edition, 1996 Keys to Soil Taxonomy is the Preble series.  

Preble soils contain durinodes.  

Sugun soils have hue redder than 10YR in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and quartzite 
Landform: alluvial flats 
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Elevation: 4,700 to 6,400 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 49 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:5 to 12 inches
Frost-free period: 110 to 140 days.            
.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ironco, Gerst, Mikim, Shotnick, and the Waterhill soils.  Ironco soils have a mollic epipedon and are on outwash plains.  Gerst soils are shallow to bedrock and are on hillslopes.  Mikim soils are fine-loamy.  Shotnick soils are well drained.  Waterhill soils have a mollic epipedon and are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; very low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for irrigated cropland and pasture.  Principle crops are alfalfa, grass hay, and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Utah; LRR D; MLRA 34.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah, 1998.  The name is taken from a geographic location in the area.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (C1, C2, and C3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 5 inches.  (A horizon)
Endosaturation:  The presence of irrigation induced saturation at depths of 20 to 60 inches during the months of April to December.
The presence of redox concentrations from 5 to 60 inches.

The CEC activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.
