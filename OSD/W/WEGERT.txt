WEGERT SERIES

The Wegert series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed volcanic ash and pumice over residuum derived from basalt.  Wegert soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wegert gravelly ashy loamy sand--on a nearly level plain at an elevation of about 1,345 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on May 18, 1994, the soil was dry throughout.)

(8 to 18 cm thick)

    2R--79 cm; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boltz, Bonnick, Borobey, Emamount, Embal, Frentera, Gardone, Oatmanflat, Picturerock, Stookmoor, and Tuffcabin series.

Boltz soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Bonnick, Borobey, Emamount, Embal, Gardone, and Picturerock soils are very deep.  Frentera soils do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section and do not have subhorizons above the lithic contact with greater than 40 percent rock fragments.  Stookmoor soils have firm, brittle horizons, do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, and do not have subhorizons above the lithic contact with greater than 40 percent rock fragments.  Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils are deep to buried duripans.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wegert soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over residuum derived from basalt.  Much of the volcanic ash is from ancestral Mt. Mazama.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,630 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bonnick, Fort Rock, Henkle, Kunceider, and Wanoga soils. Bonnick and Fort Rock are very deep. Henkle and Kunceider soils are shallow over bedrock. Wanoga soils have andic properties.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; medium or high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wegert soils are used for irrigated cropland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Alfalfa hay and barley are the principal crops.  The vegetation in rangeland is mainly mountain big sagebrush, needleandthread, Ross sedge, Indian ricegrass, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
