WILBUR SERIES

The Wilbur series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Wilbur silt loam on a nearly level area in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 125 meters (410 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm or 6 to 12 inches thick)

	Bw1--18 to 43 cm (7 to 17 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; few fine faint brown (10YR 5/3) iron depletions in the matrix; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

	Bw2--43 to 81 cm (17 to 32 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 46 to 76 cm or 18 to 30 inches.)

	Cg--81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; massive; friable; many fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) and common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wilbur soils are on nearly level flood plains and flood-plain steps. The Wilbur soils formed in silty alluvium deposited mainly from loess-covered hills and loess-covered till plains. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation from about 889 to 1168 mm (35 to 46 inches), frost free period ranges from 150 to 210 days and elevation ranges from 104 to 290 meters (340 to 950 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Birds, Haymond, and Wakeland soils. The poorly drained Birds soils are on lower lying flood-plain steps and in backswamps. The somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are typically on lower lying flood-plain steps. The well drained Haymond soils are typically on higher lying flood-plain steps and on natural levees.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderate. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible or very low. Depth to an intermittent apparent water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 0.6 meters (1.5 to 2 feet) from December through April in most years. These soils are subject to rare to frequent periods of flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. Some of the narrow flood plains are used for forest or pasture. The native vegetation is deciduous forest, chiefly of beech, elm, hickory, hackberry, buckeye, sugar maple, oak, and sycamore.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mainly in southern Indiana, and to a lesser extent in northwestern Kentucky, western Illinois, eastern Missouri, and south-central Ohio. The series is of moderate extent and is in several MLRA's. The type location is in MLRA 115A.
