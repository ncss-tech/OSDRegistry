WYNONA SERIES

The Wynona series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to slightly concave flood plains which drain the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), mean annual air temperature is about 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Cumulic Epiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wynona silty clay loam-in a tame pasture on a floodplain, at an elevation of 184 meters (604 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. [0 to 56 centimeters (0 to 22 inches) thick]

   A2--20 to 58 centimeters (8 to 23 inches); black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm; few fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) thick]

   A3--58 to 89 centimeters (23 to 35 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [20 to 64 centimeters (8 to 25 inches) thick]

   Bg1--89 to 119 centimeters (35 to 47 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak medium blocky structure; hard, firm; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; common fine black concretions; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [0 to 71 centimeters (0 to 28 inches) thick]

   Bg2--119 to 160 centimeters (47 to 63 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak medium blocky structure; hard, firm; common coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and few fine distinct light brownish gray redoximorphic depletions; few fine black concretions; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Osage County, Oklahoma; about 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) south and 1.6 kilometers (l mile) west of Skiatook; about 579 meters (1,900 feet) south and 21 meters (70 feet) west of the northeast corner of sec. 9, T. 2l N., R. 12 E.  USGS Delaware, Oklahoma topographic quadrangle; lat. 36 degrees 45 minutes 5.72 seconds N. and long. 95 degrees 37 minutes 49.15 seconds W; UTM Zone 15; 265182.00 easting and 4070547.00 northing; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum thickness: 102 to more than 152 centimeters (24 to 60 inches)
Depth to bedrock: greater than 183 centimeters (72 inches)
Mollic epipedon: 61 to more than 163 centimeters (24 to 64 inches)
Some pedons have buried horizons below 102 centimeters (40 inches)
Particle size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 27 to 35 percent

A horizon (upper portion):
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam.
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral
A horizon (lower portion):
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 to 4
Chroma: 1 or 2
Redoximorphic features: shades of red, brown and gray
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam.
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

Bg horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 1 or 2
Redoximorphic features: shades red, brown, or gray
Texture: silty clay loam or silty clay
Reaction: strongly acid to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hopco series.
Hopco soils are neutral to alkaline throughout and allow 2.5Y colors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wynona soils are on nearly level or slightly concave floodplains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in loamy and or silty alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.9 to 17.2 degrees C (57 degrees to 63 degrees F.)  Elevation is 165 to 385 meters (541 to 1263 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are from 60 to 76.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Verdigris series.  The Mason, Tullahasse, and Osage series.  Mason soils have argillic horizons, lack redoximorphic features in the mollic epipedon, and are rarely flooded.  Osage soils have a fine control section and have high shrink-swell properties.  Verdigris soils are well drained and can be rarely to frequently flooded.  Tullahassee soils have a coarse loamy control section and contain an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table is with 61 cm (2 feet) between November and April in normal years.  Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.  Wynona series is subject to occasional flooding for very brief periods between January and July in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for tame pasture.  Some areas are cultivated to small grain, grain sorghum, soybean, or alfalfa and some are used for native range or native hay meadows.  Native vegetation consists of bottomland hardwoods with an understory of grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 84A, 85, 112, 117 and 118 in eastern Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas and southwestern Missouri. The type location is in MLRA 112.  The series is moderately extensive.
