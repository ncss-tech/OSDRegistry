WINFALL SERIES

The Winfall series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy till.  These soils are on mountains and moraines.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Winfall gravelly loam, in coniferous forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    E--2 to 20 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 27 inches thick)

    E and Bt--20 to 60 inches; E part (80 percent) is pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; B part (20 percent) is brown (7.5YR 5/2) very fine sandy loam lamellae 1/8- to 3/8-inch thick, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; texture mixed is very gravelly loam, moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

This horizon is hard or very hard when dry

COMPETING SERIES:

Drexel (MT) - have greater than 35 percent shale fragments below 20 inches.
Lantern (MT) - 15 to 40 percent mica in the fine earth fraction.
Selway (MT) - has more than 50 percent coarse or very coarse sand in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - mountains and moraines.
Elevation - 3,500 to 5,500 feet.
Slope - 2 to 60 percent.
Parent material - till and drift.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs.
Mean annual precipitation - 20 to 35 inches, much of which falls as snow or as spring rain.
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  none listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Winfall soils are used for timber production, watersheds, and recreation, and as wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting of western larch, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine with an understory of common snowberry, dwarf huckleberry, blue huckleberry, common beargrass, and pinegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Winfall soils are moderately extensive in western Montana.  MLRA 43A and 44A.
