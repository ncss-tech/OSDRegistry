SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia Extent: Moderate 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Randolph County, Alabama; 1969.

REMARKS: 
Wedowee soils were formerly mapped as thin solum phases of the Appling series. The May 1990 revision changed the classification to Typic Kanhapludults in recognition of the low activity clay content of the argillic horizon. The December 2005 revision moved the type location from Randolph County, Alabama to a more representative site in Granville County, North Carolina.  The November 2025 revision changed the formatting.  No data was changed.
Revised: RLV 11/24/97; DTA 12/30/2005; DTA 11/2025

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A and E horizons)
Argillic and kandic horizon--the zone from 18 to 58 centimeters (7 to 23 inches) (Bt horizon)
