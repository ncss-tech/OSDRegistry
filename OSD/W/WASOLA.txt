WASOLA SERIES

The Wasola series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on foot slopes and basins.  They formed in loamy slope alluvium and clayey residuum.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, mesic Fragiaquic Hapludalfs

(combined thickness of the 2Btx horizon is 15 to 30 inches)

   3Bt--48 to 80 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few very fine tubular pores; common faint brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and common prominent brown (10YR 5/3) clay films on faces of peds; common medium rounded black (N 2/0) slightly hard concretions of iron and manganese; 5 percent subangular sandstone gravel; neutral (pH 7.1).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wasola soils are on very gently sloping to moderately sloping foot slopes and basins. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. They formed in loamy slope alluvium and clayey residuum. Elevations are 500 to 1,200 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alred, Eudy, Gunlock, Hartville, Pomme, Mano, and Ocie soils. Alred, Mano, and Ocie soils have contrasting particle size control sections and are on side slopes.  In addition, Ocie soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Eudy soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and are on ridge tops. Gunlock soils are fine textured and are on similar positions. Hartville soils do not have fragic properties, and are on stream terraces. Pomme soils are well drained, do not have fragic properties, and are on similar positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible to high.  Permeability is slow and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.  A water table is present at a depth of 1 to 2 feet in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for hay, pasture and timber.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks region (MLRA 116A) of southern Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. The series is of moderate extent.
