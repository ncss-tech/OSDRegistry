WINAMAC SERIES

The Winamac series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash and the underlying till or entirely in loamy and sandy outwash on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brady, Budd, Dixboro, Poseyville, and Whiskerville series and the similar Bronson series. Brady soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Bronson soils are have textures with more than 70 percent sand throughout the lower part of the series control section. Budd soils have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the Bt subhorizon just below the A horizon. Dixboro, and Poseyville soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Whiskerville soils have more than 27 percent clay and less than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winamac soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Winamac soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash and the underlying till or entirely in loamy and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brady, Bronson, Budd, Gilford, and Goodell soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Goodell soils are in depressions. The moderately well drained Bronson soils are on similar landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Brady and Budd soils are on lower lying swells on till plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 76 cm (1.5 to 2.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the outwash and moderately low in the till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy and sandy outwash and slow in the till.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly used for growing corn, soybeans, and wheat. Some areas are in grass-legume hay, pasture, or woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (13 inches) (Ap and A horizons).
Mollic intergrade: Ap horizon with moist value of 2 (5 dry) and moist and dry chroma of 2 from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 84 cm (12 to 33 inches) (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox depletions with chroma of 2 between 53 and 112 cm (21 to 44 inches) (Bt2, Bt3, and BC horizons).

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 155008 represents the typical pedon.
NASIS Data Mapunit ID 155009 represents the 1 to 5 percent slope phase.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S98IN-131-006) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, NE. Transect data for the typical pedon (T97IN-131-088) is on file in MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 70 percent Winamac, 20 percent Foresman, and 10 percent Darroch soils.
