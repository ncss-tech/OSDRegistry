WEDERTZ SERIES

The Wedertz series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Wedertz soils are on terraces and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplargids

     A2--8 to 13 cm; light gray (10YR 7/1) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine, common medium roots; common medium, few fine and very fine vesicular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

     BA--13 to 23 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular, common very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

     Bt1--23 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common medium and very fine, few fine interstitial pores; many faint clay films lining pores and many faint clay bridges between sand grains; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 36 cm thick)

     Bt2--41 to 71 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and micro roots; many very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay bridges between sand grains; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 36 cm thick)

     Bq--71 to 84 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; many thin and few moderately thick silica bridges; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

     2Bqk--84 to 152 cm; variegated light gray (10YR 7/2) and very pale brown (10YR 8/2) loam, variegated dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, brittle; very few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; discontinuous weak silica cementation; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aladshi, Alley, Allor, Chime, Cleghorn, Glyphs, Igert, Mimentor, Nevador, Qwynn, Wedlar and Zevadez series.  

Aladshi soils have a Btk and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Alley soils lack an A2 horizon and are gravelly throughout the profile.  Allor and Qwynn soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Chime and Igert soils have bedrock within 100 cm. Cleghorn and Glyphs soils have a continuous brittle horizon. Mimentor soils have durinodes within 64 cm. Nevador soils lack an A2 horizon and has a moderate to strong prismatic or blocky Bt horizon and durinodes in a friable matrix. Wedlar soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms. Zevadez ???? soils have slightly acid or neutral Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wedertz soils are on lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  They have formed in materials derived primarily from granite with some admixture of limestone, andesite and volcanic ash superimposed over lacustrine sediments.  These soils are at elevations of 1,160 to 1,676 meters in a cool, semiarid climate having mean annual temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C, and a mean summer temperature of 17 to 18 degrees C.; mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Wellington soils.  Wellington soils have an indurated duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or slow runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for livestock grazing.  A very small part is cultivated.  The principal vegetation is big sagebrush and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The valleys of western Nevada.  These soils are of moderate extent. MLRA 26.
