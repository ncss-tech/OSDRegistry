WAPI SERIES

The Wapi series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand and overlying basalt.  Wapi soils are on a basalt plain and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Lithic Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wapi loamy fine sand, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; few medium and many fine and very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable,; few medium and common fine and very fine roots; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)
    C2--10 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common fine and very fine roots; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    C3--16 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline e(pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    IIR--19 inches; fractured basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Power County, Idaho; 1 mile northeast of Bonanza Lake; 3,050 feet east and 2,170 feet south of northwest corner of section 15, T.8S., R.29E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in all parts between a depth of 12 inches and the underlying bedrock.  Depth to basalt is less than 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent angular pebbles and cobbles.  The soils are noncalcareous and neutral or mildly alkaline.

The A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3, with less than 1 unit of value difference between surface and subsurface soil in any one pedon.  Organic matter is usually less than 1 percent.

The A and C horizons are loamy fine sand or fine sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Quincy, Somsen, Vining, and Wolverine series.  All of these soils have bedrock at depths greater than 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wapi soils are on basalt plains.  The soils formed in eolian sands.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent but are dominantly less than 8 percent.  Most slopes are short and irregular due to frequent exposures of rock outcrops as knolls and ridges.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches.  The average annual temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F.  The frost free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Quincy and Vining soils and the Trevino soils.  Trevino soils have loam or silt loam texture.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range.  The natural vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, needlegrass, big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Small extent in southeastern Idaho.
