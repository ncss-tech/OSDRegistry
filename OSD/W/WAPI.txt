WAPI SERIES

The Wapi series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand and overlying basalt.  Wapi soils are on a basalt plain and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Lithic Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wapi loamy fine sand, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable; few medium and many fine and very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    C1--13 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable,; few medium and common fine and very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    C2--25 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common fine and very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    C3--41 to 48 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

    2R--48 cm; fractured basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Power County, Idaho; about 1.6 km northeast of Bonanza Lake; about 930 meters east and 661 meters south of northwest corner of section 15, T.8S., R.29E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C. 
These soils are usually dry in all parts between a depth of 30 cm and the underlying bedrock.
Depth to basalt is less than 50 cm.
Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent angular pebbles and cobbles.
The soils are noncalcareous and neutral or mildly alkaline.

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, with less than 1 unit of value difference between surface and subsurface soil in any one pedon
Organic matter: less than 1 percent.

The A and C horizons are loamy fine sand or fine sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Quincy, Somsen, Vining, and Wolverine series.  All of these soils have bedrock at depths greater than 50 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wapi soils are on basalt plains.  The soils formed in eolian sands.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent but are dominantly less than 8 percent.  Most slopes are short and irregular due to frequent exposures of rock outcrops as knolls and ridges.  Elevations range from 1220 to 1340 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 230 millimeters.  The average annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C.  The frost free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Quincy and Vining soils and the Trevino soils.  Trevino soils have loam or silt loam texture.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range.  The natural vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, needlegrass, big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Small extent in southeastern Idaho.
