WICHUP SERIES

The Wichup series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvial fan sediments derived from sandstone, quartzite, shale and small amounts of limestone.  These soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Histic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wichup loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    01--10 to 5 inches; brown, calcareous fitbrous sedge-rush peat; effervescence in upper 2 inches; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    02--5 inches to 0; black, calcareous muck with some plant residue forms and some mineral matter; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    A1g--0 to 8 inches; gray (2.5Y 5/1) gravelly loam, black (2.5Y 2/1) moist; common medium distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist mottles; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    B21g--8 to 14 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; many large prominent dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    B22g--14 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common medium distinct olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) and dark brown (10YR 4/3) mottles; massive; slightly hard, very friable; 10 percent gravel; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Colorado; center of NE 1/4 Sec. 32, T. 9 N., R. 77 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have organic surface horizons 8 to 12 inches thick.  Much horizons are not always present but if present they range in thickness from 1 to 6 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches thick.  Typically, the soil is noncalcareous to depths in excess of 60 inches except that the 01 horizon may be weakly calcareous in places.  The 1O-to 40-inch control section is sandy loam or loam with 8 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 80 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Some stratification is common, particularly in the surface horizons but organic content decreases uniformly.  Rock fragments average 0 to 15 percent but thin horizons containing 15 to 35 percent pebbles and cobbles are in some pedons.  The soils have a water table above a depth of 40 inches during most of the year.

The Alg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or less dry, 3 or less moist, and chroma of 2 or less.  It usually has distinct or prominent mottlings throughout or in some part.  This horizon has granular or crumb structure and is soft or slightly hard.  It is medium acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.0 to 7.6).

The B2g horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of more than 5.5 dry or more than 3.5 moist, and chroma of not more than 2.  It has distinct or prominent mottles of both bright and dull chroma.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 7.0 to 7.8) and is usually nearly constant in reaction with increasing depth.

A C horizon, when present, has higher chroma in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Dutson series.  Dutson soils lack histic epipedons and have argillic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvial fan sediments derived from sandstone, quartzite, shale, and small amounts of limestone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is about 48 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Dutson soils and the Greyback, Osmund, and Thayne soils.  These soils lack histic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for wet meadow pastures.  Hydrophytic plants dominate the community.  The main plants are sedges, rushes, tufted hairgrass, willows, shrubby cinquefoil, Poa spp., and marsh buttercup.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The soils are confined to mountain meadows of moderately high and high elevation in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Montana.  They are of small extent.
