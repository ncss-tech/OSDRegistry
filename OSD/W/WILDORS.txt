WILDORS SERIES

The Wildors series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian material over basalt.  Wildors soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Haploduridic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wildors very stony sandy loam - on a 7 percent south-facing slope at an elevation of 4,610 feet in rangeland.  When described on August 21, 1980, the profile was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak, fine, granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; about 40 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; about 40 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw2--10 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 40 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 13 inches thick)

    BK--15 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak, medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 30 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; strong effervescence (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    2Bkq--18 to 22 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very stony sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; about 30 percent weakly cemented fractured and displaced duripan fragments, 2-7 cm in length, between rock fragments; 30 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; violent effervescence (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4), abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 13 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--22 to 24 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) indurated duripan, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; few very fine and fine roots matted along horizontal upper surface of duripan; about 15 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent gravel; strongly cemented plates with laminar capping (1-6 mm thick), continuous silica and calcium carbonate cementation between rock fragments; violent effervescence (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    3R--24 inches; lime-coated basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Stubblefield series.  Stubblefield soils have bedrock above 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wildors soils are on basalt plains and buttes.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 5,000 feet.  The soil formed in eolian material over basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains.  The average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Deerhorn, Cox, Pedleford, McCarey, Molyneux, Pagari, and Rehfield.  Deerhorn soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Cox soils are 10 to 20 inches deep.  Pagari and Rehfield soils are greater than 40 inches deep and lack duripans.  McCarey and Pedleford soils lack duripans and have MAST less than 47 degrees F.  Molyneux soils are very deep, lack a duripan, and have an average annual soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F.  Deerhorn, Cox, Pedleford, McCarey, and Pagari soils occur on convex positions on basalt plains.  Molyneux and Rehfield soils occur in drainageways and depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is slow to medium.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is Basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, rabbitbrush, and Nevada bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  The series is of limited extent.
