WHISKEYRUN SERIES

The Whiskeyrun series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from tuff. Whiskeyrun soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitritorrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Whiskeyrun gravelly ashy loam at an elevation of 1,390 meters, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is partly covered by 10 percent gravel.
