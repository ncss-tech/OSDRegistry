WEARYRIVER SERIES

The Wearyriver series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in grassy organic parent material. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic Typic Cryofibrists

TYPICAL PEDON: Wearyriver peat, located on a dip of a plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 5 meters; when described on July 27th, 2007 the soil was saturated throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi1--0 to 30 cm; black (10YR 2/1) peat; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and common coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); diffuse wavy boundary

 Oi2--30 to 183 cm; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) peat; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4)
