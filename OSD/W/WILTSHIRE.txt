WILTSHIRE SERIES

The Wiltshire series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils. Permeability is slow. They have formed in colluvium from micaceous schist over marble residuum. They occur on upland depressions and footslopes of the northern piedmont. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 50 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 50 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs

(10 to 20 inches)

  2C1--43 to 51 inches;  brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly clay loam; weak thin platy structure; firm; 45 percent sub-rounded mixed-igneous and metamorphic gravel; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. Consistency is firm in place, friable in hand.

  2C3--62 to 98 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely channery sandy loam; common coarse distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles throughout; massive; friable; 80 percent sub-angular schist-basic channers; slightly acid. (Combined thickness of the 2C horizons is 19 to 50 inches)

TYPE LOCATION: Frederick County, MD; located approximately 1 mile east of New Market; in a pasture field; about 1,650 feet north of Rt. 144, and 650 feet west of Detrick Road.  Latitude 39 degrees 23 minutes 25 seconds; Longitude 77 degrees 14 minutes 40 seconds

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 25 to 45 inches. Rock fragments of mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks such as phyllite, schist, calcareous schist and phyllite, marble and greenstone range from 0 to 25 percent in the horizons above the fragipan, and from 25 to 80 percent in the C horizons. Reaction ranges from strongly acid too neutral.

The Ap horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or I0YR, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.

The BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 through 6, chroma 4 through 8. Texture is silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. .

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value 4 through 6, chroma 4 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.

The Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value 4 through 6, chroma 4 through 8. Texture is silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.

Depth to discontinuity ranges form 25 to 40 inches.  Redoximorphic features are common throughout the horizon. Prism faces are approximately 7 to 12 inches apart.

The 2C horizon, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value 4 through 6, chroma 4 through 8. Texture is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.

COMPETING SERIES: Wiltshire is the only series in this family.  The Clarksburg, Comly, Gatton, Homewood, Hustontown, Jonca, Readington, and Wooster soils are in the similar families. Clarsksburg soils are superactive and have rock fragments dominantly from sandstone, chert and limestone. Homewood soils are superactive and have sub-rounded shale, sandstone and limestone fragments. Comly soils are active and have rock fragments dominantly from granitic gneiss, shale and sandstone. Hustontown soils are active and have rock fragments of shale, siltstone and sandstone. Jonca soils are active and lack rock fragments of metamorphic rocks.  Readington soils are active and have 5YR and redder hues in the Bt horizon.  Gatton and Wooster soils have not been assigned a CEC class. .

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wiltshire soils are on nearly level to slightly concave upland flats, footslopes and edges of drainage swales.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils developed in colluvial materials of micaceous schist, phyllite, and greenstone schist over residual material weathered from low-grade marble. The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F. The growing season ranges from 140 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Baltimore, Benevola, Chester, Conestoga, Funkstown, Glenelg, Hollinger, Hyattstown, Linganore, and Manor soils. Chester, Glenelg, and Manor soils are in residuum from mica schists and have less than 35 percent base saturation. Conestoga and Hollinger soils formed in residuum weathered from micaeous limestone and calcareous schist. Hagerstown soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Hyattstown and Linganore soils have bedrock within 40 inches and occupy higher landscape positions. Benevola occupies similar landscape positions, lacks a fragipan, and is formed from marble residuum.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper solum very slow just above and in the fragipan, and slow in the substratum. Run off is slow on gentle slopes and high on steeper slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are in urban settings. Some areas are in pasture or used for crop production.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Maryland and possibly Pennsylvania. The soils of this series are not extensive. (MLRA148)
