WOCUS SERIES

The Wocus series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in material derived from water tolerant herbaceous plants over diatomaceous earth. The Wocus soils are on sag ponds and marshes in valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic Typic Cryohemists 

TYPICAL PEDON: Wocus muck - on a 0 percent slope at an elevation of 4,130 feet. (When described on July 21, 2004, the soil was wet throughout and the water table was at 38 inches. The lower part of the profile was described using auger borings due to permanent standing water. Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

(The combined thickness of the Oe horizon is 20 to 50 inches) 

  Oa3--53 to 61 inches; black (2.5Y 2.5/1) rubbed and broken face muck, 80 percent very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) and 20 percent gray (2.5Y 5/1) dry; 10 percent unrubbed fiber, 0 percent rubbed; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; weakly smeary; many very fine irregular pores; presence of sulfidic materials indicated by strong odor; slightly acid, pH 6.2; clear smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Koyuktolik and the Mariel series. Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic material derived from woody plants and are at elevations of 10 to 1,000 feet. Mariel soils have hemic material in the surface tier and are in mountain meadows. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wocus soils are on floodplains and sag ponds in valleys. Elevation ranges from 4,120 to 4,160 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Wocus soils formed in organic material derived from water tolerant plants over diatomaceous earth. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 32 inches. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The average annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is 5 to 45 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kirk, Wocusbay, and Yamsay soils. Kirk soils are ashy-pumiceous and are on floodplains. Wocusbay soils have diatomaceous layers in the upper part and are on adjacent alluvial fans and floodplains. Yamsay soils are dominantly sapric material and vegetation is dominated by tules.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; moderate permeability. These soils are frequently ponded for long periods from January to August. Some areas are drained and protected from flooding. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat. The potential natural vegetation is water sedge, beaked sedge, Baltic rush, and spikerush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon, MLRA 6 and 21. The soils are inextensive.
