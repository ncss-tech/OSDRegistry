WAUNETA SERIES

The Wauneta series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium. Wauneta soils are on relict terraces and washes. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Cambidic Haplodurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Wauneta loamy sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

     C--0 to 7 inches (0 to 18 centimeters); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; 9 percent clay; single grain; loose, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; fine irregular pores; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2; abrupt smooth boundary. 

     2Bkq--7 to 18 inches (18 to 44 centimeters); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; 5 percent clay; massive; extremely hard, very firm, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine vesicular pores; many irregular very strongly cemented silica concretions around rock fragments and many irregular very strongly cemented carbonate concretions around rock fragments; 2 percent gravel; slightly effervescent, 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline, pH 8.6; abrupt wavy boundary. 

     2Bkqm--18 to 31 inches (44 to 79 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderately cemented duripan; abrupt wavy boundary. 

     2Bqm1--31 to 42 inches (79 to 107 centimeters); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderately cemented duripan; abrupt wavy boundary. 

     2Bqm2--42 to 60 inches (107 to 152 centimeters); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderately cemented duripan.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wauneta soils are in dry washes of moderately weathered lava flows and on relict terraces of cinders and basalt at elevations of 4,400 to 5,700 feet (1,340 to 1,740 meters). Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from various pyroclastics. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains and snowfall during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.2 to 13.9 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Miburn (AZ), and Tuweep (AZ), soils.  Tuweep soils form in basalt residuum, have calcic and argillic horizons, are moderately deep, and have more than 14 percent clay and less than 35 percent gravel fragments in the particle size control section.  Miburn soils are shallow deposits of tephra over sedimentary deposits.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes galleta, broom snakeweed, black grama, and fourwing saltbush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. Wauneta soils are of moderate extent. This soil is named after a vacant trading post. MLRA 35 Land Resource Unit 35.2. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Coconino County, Arizona; Bighawk Valley Soil Survey Update Project, AZ, 2016

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

The epipedon is neither mollic nor ochric because rock structure exists in surface fragments and within the upper two horizons.  Mollic colors are due to mafic origin. 

Duripan - the zone from 18 to 60 inches (44 to 152 cm) (Bkqm and Bqm horizons) 

Particle size control section - the zone from 10 to 18 inches (25 to 100 cm) (Bk horizons)

Petrocalcic materials and/or petrocalcic horizons may be present in some pedons
