MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Reconnaissance Soil Survey of southwestern Pennsylvania, 1909.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 28 cm (A, E and BE horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 28 to 81 cm (Bt horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 127 cm

This edit updates the previous format to semi-tabular using the March 22, 2013 template, and updates the Range in Individual Horizons, RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS, GEOGRAPHIC SETTING, GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS, and DRAINAGE AND SATURATED CONDUCTIVITY sections.

The previous revision (12/2012) changed the TYPE LOCATION because soil survey update activities in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, (previous type location) did not include the series in correlation.
