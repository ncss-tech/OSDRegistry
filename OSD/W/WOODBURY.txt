Surface runoff potential--low or very low
Flooding--rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, and wheat. Most areas are drained by surface ditches or land grading. A very few areas are irrigated. The native vegetation is big bluestem, western wheatgrass, sedges, blue grama and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
LRR M, MLRA 107; along the Missouri River in Iowa and Nebraska. This series is of moderate extent.
