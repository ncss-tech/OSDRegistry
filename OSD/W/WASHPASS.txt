WASHPASS SERIES

The Washpass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt and tuff-breccia. Washpass soils are on north-facing footslopes and backslopes of hills, buttes, and escarpments. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are 25 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bassel (CO), Burgess (WY), Ethelman (CO), Greenman (WY), Opitz (MT), Spinney (CO), and Tiagos (CO) series. Bassel soils have high amounts of medium and coarse angular sand and fine granite pebbles, and have horizons with continuous accumulations of secondary calcium carbonates within 40 inches of the surface. Spinney soils have non-contrasting sandy-skeletal substrata above a depth of 40 inches. In addition, Spinney contains carbonates within 40 inches. Burgess, Ethelman, and Greenman soils have bedrock within 40 inches. Opitz soils are moderately deep to grus and deep to hard bedrock. Tiagos soils have mean summer soil temperatures of 48 to 58 degrees F, are neutral or mildly alkaline, and receive less total precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Washpass soils are on north-facing footslopes and backslopes of hills, buttes, and escarpments. They formed in colluvium derived from Tertiary basalt and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 25 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,200 to 9,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Owlspring (T), Sonsela (T), Todacheene (T), and Viewpoint soils. Owlspring soils are fine-silty, somewhat poorly drained, and occur on toeslopes. Todacheene soils are fine-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on footslopes and fan terraces. Viewpoint soils are shallow to basalt, and occur on adjacent shoulders. Sonsela soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent south-facing backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Washpass soils are used for timber production and livestock grazing. Present vegetation is quaking aspen, Douglas fir, and corkbark fir with an understory of Kentucky bluegrass, earth sedge, nodding bromegrass, mountain snowberry, Oregongrape, and wild strawberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Washpass soils are of small extent on the Defiance Uplift-Chuska Mountains portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Juan County, New Mexico, Shiprock Area Soil Survey, 1993. Washpass is a coined name derived from Washington Pass in the Chuska Mountains.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 14 inches. (A and BA horizon)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 14 to about 87 inches. (Bt/E1, Bt/E2, Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Organic carbon content determined by Inter-Mountain Laboratories, Inc.  A soil similar to Washpass was sampled for the NSSL in 1986 in the Fort Defiance soil survey area. It was given the name Washpass and sampled as pedon # S86-NM-045-004. The taxonomic classification of that soil is different from this current proposal.
