WRAYS SERIES


The Wrays series consist of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and the underlying residuum from siltstone. They are on hills and knobs. Slopes range from 6 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: Purcellville is the only competing series and does not have a lithic contact within 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wrays soils are on moderately sloping and strongly sloping shoulders and backslopes of hills and knobs. Slopes range from 6 to 25 percent. They formed in 56 to 91 cm or 22 to 36 inches of loess and the underlying residuum from siltstone. The bedrock is from the upper part of the Spickert Knob Formation, Borden Group, in Indiana (See Remarks). The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brownstown, Gilwood, Gnawbone, Spickert and Wellrock soils. The moderately deep, well drained Brownstown soils are on backslopes. The moderately deep, well drained Gilwood soils are typically on shoulders and the upper part of backslopes. The moderately well drained Spickert soils have a fragipan and typically are on summits and shoulders. The moderately deep, well drained Gnawbone soils and the well drained, less channery Wellrock soils typically are on similar landform positions as the Wrays soils, but at lower elevations.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately slow in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is medium.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in mixed hardwood trees, the native vegetation. Some areas are used for pasture and a few areas are used for growing row crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This series is of small extent, but as soil surveys are updated MLRA 120C the extent will increase considerably. Wrays soils are in southeastern and south-central Indiana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Scott County, Indiana, 1995.

REMARKS: Wrays soils were previously correlated as a taxadjunct to the Wellston series in MLRA 120C. Geological Survey Occasional Paper 43 from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources describes the Spickert Knob Formation in Indiana.

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: 
1) Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm or 6 inches (E/A horizon) 
2) Argillic horizon: 15 to 86 cm or 6 to 34 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3 horizons) 
3) Lithic contact: 112 to 152 cm or 44 to 60 inches (R horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data for this pedon, S90IN-143-005, is at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.
