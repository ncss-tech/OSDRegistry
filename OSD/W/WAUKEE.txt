WAUKEE SERIES

The Waukee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy alluvium or outwash and in the underlying sandy to gravelly alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys and in outwash areas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 875 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Waukee loam, on a north-facing, convex slope of about 1 percent, on a stream terrace, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 49 centimeters.)

 Bw1--46 to 61 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint discontinuous dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coats on faces of peds; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 20 to 40 centimeters.)

 2C2--122 to 203 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; few fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; about 10 percent mixed gravel, slightly acid.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Howard County, Iowa, 1969

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A, Bw1, Bw2, and 2C1 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A, Bw1, Bw2, 2C1, and 2C2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 84 centimeters (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

The type location was moved from Howard County, Iowa to Black Hawk County, Iowa as laboratory data (NSSL) from the site in Howard County, Iowa did not support the series concept.
