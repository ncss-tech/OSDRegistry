WHITLOCK SERIES

The Whitlock series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Whitlock soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Whitlock sandy loam-cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 12 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and many fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk1--12 to 29 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and many fine roots; common very fine and fine and few medium irregular pores; many medium and coarse nodules and soft accumulations of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent, moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 40 inches thick)

    Bk2--29 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; slightly hard, very friable; few medium and many fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; few medium nodules and soft accumulations of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Graham County, Arizona, 1,000 feet east and 100 feet north of the southwest corner of Section 30, T. 6 S, R 25 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June. Typic aridic moisture regime.

Rock Fragments: Averages 0 to 15 percent in the control section, but can range to 35 percent in any one horizon

Soil Temperature: 59 to 72 degrees F.

Depth to calcic horizon: 5 to 20 inches

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 30 percent

Sand size fraction: More than 50 percent fine or coarser in upper part of the control section

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4, dry or moist

B horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 to 8 dry, 3 to 8 moist
Chroma:  1 to 6, dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the upper part; can range to include finer or coarser textures in the lower part of the control section.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Algerita (I) (NM), Cronese (CA), Grapevine (NV), Guijarral (CA), Kinley (AZ), Nikey (UT), Rillino (AZ), Wink (TX), and Yipin (I) (NM).  Algerita and Yippin soils are inactive. Cronese, Grapevine, Guijarral, Kinley, and Nikey soils are in the Mohave Desert and are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Rillino soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Wink soils have a calcic horizon below 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whitlock soils are on fan remnants at elevations of 2,000 to 5,640 feet.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 275 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Latene, Rillino, Anthony, Cave, Continental, Mohave, Stagecoach, Pinaleno and Tres Hermanos soils.  Anthony soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Cave soils have an indurated hardpan at depths less than 20 inches.  Continental, Mohave, Pinaleno and Tres Hermanos soils have an argillic horizon.  Stagecoach soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Medium runoff.  Moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Whitlock soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is creosotebush, mesquite, whitethorn, cacti, fluffgrass, bush muhly, and annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona and New Mexico. This series is of moderate extent. MLRA 41.
