WENTRIDGE SERIES

The Wentridge series consists of moderate deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  Wentridge soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 50 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wentridge loam, on a north facing, concave, 80 percent slope in shadscale dominated rangeland at an elevation of 5,000 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate thin and medium platy structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    C--3 to 12 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Cy--12 to 25 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sandy loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; common very fine and fine gypsum flakes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of the C horizons ranges from 18 to 36 inches thick)

    Cr--25 to 38 inches; weathered sandstone.

    R--38 inches; unweathered sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 6 miles north and 2 miles east of Red Wash; located about 2,600 feet south and 1,760 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 25, T.6S., R.22E., SLBM; Rasmussen Hollow USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 16 minutes 18 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 23 minutes 32 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Typic Aridic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  47 to 50 degrees F.
Particle-size control section:  8 to 18 percent clay
Depth to paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to weathered sandstone
Depth to lithic contact:  30 to 50 inches to unweathered sandstone
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent 
SAR: 0 to 5 

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
C horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture:  fine sandy loam or sandy loam
Gypsum:  0 to 2 percent in the upper part; 4 to 8 percent in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Geer, Jenrid, and Shotnick series.  Competitors prior to the Seventh Edition, 1996 Keys to Soil Taxonomy are the Apron, Fang, Fruitland, Ganaflan, Jeddito, Kumiva, Marcou, Mazuma, Moepitz, Piltdown, Sodaspring, Tooele, Trachute, Vanderhoff, and Worland series.

Apron, Fang, Fruitland, Geer, Jeddito, Jenrid, Kumiva, Marcou, Mazuma, Piltdown, Shotnick, Sodaspring, Tooele, and Trachute:  do not have a lithic contact within 60 inches.
Ganaflan and Vanderhoff:  have xeric moisture patterns.
Moepitz:  have hue redder than 10YR
Worland:  have soil moisture control sections affected by peak periods of precipitation in the spring, and do not have accumulation of gypsum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.
Landform:  hills
Slopes:  50 to 80 percent
Elevation: 4,800 to 5,200 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 8 inches.
Frost-free period:  110 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Denco, Milok, and Turzo series.

Denco soils occur on hillslopes and have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

Milok soils occur on fan remnants and are very deep.

Turzo soils occur on alluvial flats and are very deep.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are wildlife habitat and recreation.  The potential native plant community is shadscale, bud sagebrush, Castle Valley saltbush, galleta and Salina wildrye.  These soils have been correlated to Desert Very Steep Shallow Loam (Shadscale) - 034XY133UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah, 1998.  The name is coined after a nearby geographic location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 25 inches.  (C and Cy horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Secondary gypsum:  The presence of visible gypsum from 12 to 25 inches.  (Cy horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered sandstone at 25 inches.  (Cr horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with unweathered sandstone at 38 inches.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the superactive cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
