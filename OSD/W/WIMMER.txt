WIMMER SERIES

The Wimmer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks mainly sandstone and shale.  Wimmer soils are on fan remnants and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  (Bw, Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 28 cm.  (Bw horizon)

Calcic horizon:  The zone from 28 to 184 cm.  (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 and BCk horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
