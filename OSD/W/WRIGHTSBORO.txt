WRIGHTSBORO SERIES

The Wrightsboro series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on broad interstream divides in the lower Coastal Plain.  These soils formed in loamy and clayey marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent and are dominantly less than 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., near the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Aquic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wrightsboro fine sandy loam--cultivated; elevation of 30 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam; weak medium granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

     E--6 to 9 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

     Bt1--9 to 24 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Bt2--24 to 36 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay loam; common medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) and very pale brown (10YR 6/3) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Bt3--36 to 48 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay loam medium; many medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/1) and common medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/8) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 32 to 72 inches)

     2Bg--48 to 65 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay with few strata of very fine sand and silt; many coarse distinct yellow (10YR 7/8) and common prominent reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) mottles; common reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) mottles surround old root channels; weak fine angular blocky structure; very firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine flakes of mica; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  New Hanover County, North Carolina; 3.5 miles north of Wilmington on U.S. Highway 117, 110 feet west of U.S. Highway 117, 50 feet north of Secondary Road 1329.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches and is commonly more than several hundred feet.  The clayey 2B horizon is at a depth of 40 to 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except where surface layers have been limed.  Limed soils typically have slightly acid or neutral surface layers.  Flakes of mica range from none to common in the B and C horizons.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.

The BE or BA horizon, where present, has 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  Clay content averages 24 to 35 percent and silt content is less than 30 percent.

The Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Mottles are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  Clay content averages 24 to 35 percent and silt content is less than 30 percent.

The 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Mottles are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is clay or sandy clay.  Most pedons have lenses or fine strata of sandy or silty material.

The 2BCg or 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Mottles are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is clay or sandy clay.  Most pedons have lenses or fine strata of sandy or silty material.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goldston, Izagora, Kullit, Quitman, and Whitwell soils in the same family, and the Altavista, Tetotum, Craven, Duplin, Foreston, Stallings, Johns, Kempsville, and Ogeechee soils in similar families.  Goldston and Whitwell soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within 40 to 80 inches.  Altavista and Tetotum soils have mixed mineralogy.  Craven and Duplin soils have a clayey particle-size control section.  Foreston and Stallings soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Kullit soils have hue of 5YR in part of the Bt horizon.  Johns soils have solum thickness less than 40 inches and have a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Kempsville soils do not have low chroma mottles in the upper subsoil.  Ogeechee soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less throughout the upper subsoil.  Quitman soils have a Btx horizon, and in addition do not have a lithologic discontinuity and a clayey 2B horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wrightsboro soils are on broad interstream divides in the lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent, but are dominantly less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in fluvial and marine sediments that have mixed mineralogy.  The average annual rainfall ranges from about 38 to 55 inches, the frost free season ranges from about 220 to 256 days, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 71 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Craven, Foreston, Kempsville, Ogeechee, and Stallings series and the Pactolus, Paxville, Torhunta, and Woodington soils.  Pactolus soils are sandy throughout.  Paxville and Torhunta soils have an umbric epipedon and Torhunta and Woodington soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; and moderate permeability in the upper subsoil (Bt) and slow permeability in the lower subsoil (2Bg).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most area are cleared and used for cultivated crops and pasture.  Many areas are used for residential and industrial development.  Forested areas are in mixed hardwood and pines with understory of myrtle, gallberry, dogwood, and holly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The lower Coastal Plain of North Carolina and possibly South Carolina and Virginia.  The series is of small extent.
