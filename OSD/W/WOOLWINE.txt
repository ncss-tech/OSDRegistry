MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Henry County, Virginia, 1995. 

REMARKS: The Woolwine series is a mesic counterpart of the Bethlehem series. The 04/1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia placed the original Bethlehem type location within the mesic area. Type location moved 11/1998 to Alexander County, NC.
