WAGONHOUND SERIES

The Wagonhound series consists of very deep well drained soils on upland hillslopes.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from various sources.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Larimer, Albinas, Brownrigg, Lambman, Willowman, Recluse, Featherlegs and Wolf soils.  
Albinas, Willowman, Recluse, Featherlegs, and Wolf have mollic epipedons.  Brownrigg and Lambman soils are shallow. Larimer are sandy or sandy-skeletal in the substratum.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low to medium
