MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2003.

REMARKS: Wolftrap soils were previously mapped with the White Store series.  The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic soil temperature regime line necessitated the establishment the Wolftrap series as a White Store counterpart.

Diagnostic horizons and soil features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 31 inches (Btss horizons)
Slickensides--the presence of slickensides in a zone from 8 to 31 inches (Btss horizon)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Vertic feature--linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between the mineral soil surface and a depth of 100 cm
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: No laboratory data available.
