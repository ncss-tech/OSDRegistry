WINSPECT SERIES

The Winspect series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alpine till, alluvium, and colluvium derived mainly from limestone, dolomite, sandstone, and argillite.  These soils are on till plains, moraines, alluvial fans, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Winspect cobbly loam, 2 to 8 percent slopes, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; common fine and very fine irregular pores; 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    ABk--4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 15 percent cobbles; 10 percent gravel; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--8 to 18 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) cobbly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 20 percent cobbles; 10 percent gravel; many medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 30 inches thick)

   Bk2--18 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; 25 percent cobbles; 25 percent gravel; common medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Winspect soils are used mainly as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Columbia needlegrass, prairie junegrass, shrubby cinquefoil, creeping juniper, and forbs.  These soils also support low density stands of limber pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, and Douglas-fir.
