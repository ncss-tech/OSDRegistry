SERIES ESTABLISHED: Taylor County, Iowa, 1948.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 48 to 98 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 200 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 64 centimeters (Ap, A, and Btg1 horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 200 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 and Btg5 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Further study is needed to differentiate Edinburg, Taintor, Virden and Winterset series.

This update changes the classification from fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiaquolls.  The linear extensibility is 6.04 centimeters between the surface and a depth of 100 centimeters. The classification of one the most common associates, Macksburg series, was recently changed to fine, smectitic, mesic Aquertic Argiudolls, based on linear extensibility.
