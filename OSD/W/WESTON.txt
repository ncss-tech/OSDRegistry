WESTON SERIES

 The Weston series is a member of a coarse-loamy, siliceous,
 thermic family of Typic Ochraquults.  The Weston soils have light
 colored, friable, acid, sandy loam surface soils, underlain by
 sandy loam mottled gray, very strongly acid subsoils.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Typic Endoaquults

 TYPICAL PEDON:  Weston fine sandy loam - forested.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

      Oi--0 to 1 inches, pine needles, leaves, and twigs.

      A1--1 to 5 inches, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; few fine soft dark bodies; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

      A2--5 to 10 inches, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, few fine faint brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; few fine pores; few fine dark concretions; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

      Btg--10 to 25 inches, gray (10YR 6/1) sandy loam, common fine and medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine pores; sand grains coated and bridged with clay; few fine dark concretions; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 24 inches thick)

      Bg--25 to 45 inches, mottled light gray (10YR 7/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few roots; many fine pores; few fine dark concretions; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (16 to 24 inches thick)

      Cg--45 to 55 inches, mottled gray (10YR 6/1) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) stratified layers of sand, silt, and clay; massive; firm; very strongly acid.

 TYPE LOCATION:  Cleveland County, Arkansas; 4 miles south of Dallas County line on highway 167, then east 1 1/2 miles on dirt road to Croak school, then north 1.1 miles, 75 feet west of road;
 NW1/4NE1/4NE1/4sec. 25, T. 8 S., R. 13 W.

 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from about 36 to 56 inches thick.

 The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.

The A1 or Ap horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or very dark gray (10YR 3/1).  The A2 horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) or
pale brown (10YR 6/3); some pedons have values of 5 or chromas of 1, and mottles of brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/8).

The Btg horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1) or light gray 10YR 7/1) mottled with shades of yellow and brown; textures include sandy loam or loam.  Clay content of the B2tg horizon ranges from 5 to
18 percent, silt content is 20 to 50 percent, and the horizon contains more than 15 percent of material coarser than very fine sand.  Reaction of the B horizons ranges from very strongly acid
to extremely acid.

Average texture of the stratified C horizon ranges from sandy loam to loam.

 COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Caddo, Leaf, Myatt, Rains, and Smithton series.  All except Smithton soils are finer textured and contain more than 18 percent clay in the B horizons.  Smithton soils have sola thicker than 60 inches.

 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Weston soils occur on nearly level to gently rolling  uplands, coastal flatwoods, and stream terraces.  Some of the stream terraces have undulating relief consisting of a succession of shallow depressions and low ridges.  Slope gradient seldom exceeds 3 percent.  The soil formed in coarse to moderately fine textured, stratified marine and fluvatile deposits.

 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Caddo and  Myatt series.  Also associated are the Pheba and Stough soils, both of which have fragipans.

 DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  Many depressions as well as level areas are ponded for several days during wet season.

 USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the soil is in forests of gum, cypress, southern yellow pines, maple, and water oak; undergrowth of shrubs and vines is heavy in most places.  Cleared areas are
used for small grains, corn, soybeans, and pasture.

 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coastal Plain, western Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

 SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hancock County, Mississippi; 1930.

 REMARKS:  The Weston series was formerly classified in the Low-Humic Gley great soil group.  The soil horizon depths were modified on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.
