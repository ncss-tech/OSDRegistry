WARE SERIES

The Ware series consists of well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. They have moderate permeablity in the solum and moderately rapid to rapid
in the underlying material. Slope gradients range from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees
F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Fluventic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Ware loam - on a south facing convex slope of about 2 percent in a cultivated field. (Colors are moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam; weak medium granular structure; friable; common roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

	A1--7 to 11 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam; weak medium granular structure; friable; few roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

	A2--11 to 14 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam; weak coarse granular structure; friable; few roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

	Bw--14 to 21 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

	C1--21 to 30 inches; stratified yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy very fine sand and brown (10YR 4/3) and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very fine sandy loam; single grained; very friable; few roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

	C2--30 to 38 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and brown (10YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam; massive; very friable; few lenses of dark brown (10YR 3/3); neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

	C3--38 to 54 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam; massive; very friable; few lenses of dark brown (10YR 3/3) in upper 6 inches and streaks of pale brown (10YR 6/3) in lower part; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

	C4--54 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very fine sandy loam; massive; very friable; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Jackson County, Illinois, about 1/4 mile southeast of Neunert, 660 feet south and 690 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 27, T. 9 S., R.
4 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches. The solum ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline. The lower part
of the control section has a high percentage of sand but, because of the amount of very fine sand, it is not a strongly contrasting particle size class. The dominant size
of sand in the control section is very fine.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or
medium granular.

The Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 except that chroma of 2 is allowed with value of 3 in pedons where
mixing with surface horizons has occurred. The texture is loam or very fine sandy loam. The structure is fine or medium subangular blocky. The lower part in some
pedons is stratified with coarser textured or finer textured strata.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or more. It commonly is stratified and ranges from silt loam to sand but dominantly very fine
sandy loam to fine sand. The C horizon is commonly neutral but some pedons are slightly alkaline and contain carbonates.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cleora and Galtsmill soils. Cleora soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium that contains fine sand as the
dominant size sand fraction in the control section. Galtsmill soils have mica flakes throughout the profile and a solum thickness of more than 30 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ware soils are on broad alluvial plains and low ridges on the Mississippi River flood plain in MLRA 131 and MLRA 115B. Slopes range from 1 to 6
percent. The soils formed in moderately fine textured loamy sediments that generally are stratified below about 15 inches. The underlying material normally grades to
sandy with depth. Climate consists of hot summers and cold winters. Mean annaul temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 40
to 48 inches. These soils are occasionally flooded for brief periods of time from April through June where not protected by levees.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowdre, Cairo, Gorham, and Darwin soils. These soils contain more clay in the solum and are not
well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained or moderately well drained. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid to rapid in the
underlying material. Runoff is slight on the nearly level areas and moderate on the sloping areas.

USE AND VEGETATION: Largely under cultivation. Crops are corn, soybeans, wheat and meadow. Native vegetation was grass and cottonwood, sycamore,
maple, and pecan trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Flood plains along the Mississippi River in southern Illinois, western Kentucky, and possibly southern Missouri. The extent is
small.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Alexander County, Illinois, 1967.

REMARKS: The Ware series was transferred to the Little Rock, Arkansas MLRA Office in 5/2002. This series was previously owned and maintained by
Indianapolis, Indiana. MLRA 115B added in 9/2002 because type location is within this geographic area.

Diagnositic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - 0 to 14 inches (Ap, A1, A2 horizons)

Cambic horizon - 14 to 21 inches (Bw horizon)

Irregular organic carbon distribution - Irregular decrease of organic matter
with depth between 10 and 50 inches. (Bg horizons)
