WINFIELD SERIES

The Winfield series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess on hills and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 914 millimeters (36 inches.

[Combined thickness of the Bt and Btg horizons is 51 to 109 centimeters (20 to 43 inches).]

 Cg--137 to 183 centimeters (54 to 72 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam; massive; friable; few fine roots; many fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron in ped interiors; common very dark brown iron-manganese masses; moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baraboo, Birkbeck, Cadiz, Campton, Elco, Eleroy, Inton, Iona, Libre, Mayville, Minnith, Morningsun, Redbud, Rocheport, Rockfield, Somonauk, and Uniontown series. Baraboo, Eleroy, and Rocheport soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 200 centimeters. Birkbeck, Campton, Elco, Libre, Mayville, Minnith, Morningsun, Rockfield, and Somonauk soils have more than 10 percent sand in some subhorizon within the series control section. Cadiz soils have rock fragments within the series control section. Inton soils have a matrix with a hue yellower than 10YR within 76 centimeters (30 inches) of the surface. Iona soils have carbonates within a depth to 200 centimeters. Redbud soils have a lithologic discontinuity (lacustrine deposits) in the lower part of the series control section. Uniontown soils have calcium carbonate concretions in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winfield soils are on ridgetops, sideslopes, summits, shoulders, and backslopes of hills, and on treads of high stream terraces. The soils formed in loess. Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 20 percent with an extreme range up to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1,067 (32 to 42 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Menfro, Marion and Weller soils. The Winfield series is the moderately well drained soil in a drainage sequence with the well drained Menfro soils and commonly are on lower slopes. The somewhat poorly drained Marion and the moderately well drained Weller soils contain more clay in the series control section and are upslope from the Winfield soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTVITY: Moderately well drained. In undisturbed areas, depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 100 centimeters (2.0 to 3.5 feet) between November and April in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.0 to 14.11 micrometers/sec). Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cleared and used to grow soybeans, small grains, corn, hay, and pasture. Remaining areas are in hardwood forest. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwoods (oak and hickory).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 107, 112, and 115 in central and eastern Missouri bordering the river valleys of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, and in west-central and southwestern Illinois on loess hills along the Mississippi River. The type location is in MLRA 115. The series is of large extent.
