WANN SERIES

The Wann series includes very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains in river valleys in Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75. Slope ranges 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (5l degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 640 millimeters (25 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wann fine sandy loam - with a slope of less than l percent in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine roots throughout; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A--15 to 41 centimeters (6 to l6 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak coarse blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, friable; common fine roots throughout; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.  (Combined A horizons 25 to 49 centimeters (10 to 19 inches) thick.)

  C--41 to 127 centimeters (l6 to 50 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist, with thin strata of gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (61 to 91 centimeters (24 to 36 inches) thick)

  Cg--127 to 152 centimeters (50 to 60 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; single grain; loose; soft white masses of calcium carbonate above 132 centimeters (52 inches); strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.
