WINEGLASS SERIES


The Wineglass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium and residuum derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 8 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Argicryolls  

TYPICAL PEDON: Wineglass very gravelly loam, forested, on a 26 percent slope at 5480 feet elevation. When described on October 26, 1999 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted).

	Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed plant material; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

	A--1 to 12 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong fine and moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; common fine and medium irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick)

	Bt1--12 to 25 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse and moderate very coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine and common medium roots; common fine and medium irregular pores; few distinct and faint clay films on vertical faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

	Bt2--25 to 34 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) cobbly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse and very coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine and common medium irregular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and few distinct clay films on surfaces along root channels; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 10 to 24 inches thick)

	Bk1--34 to 44 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) extremely cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine medium and coarse roots; common medium and coarse irregular pores; common fine faint carbonate coats around and on the bottom surfaces of rock fragments; common fine prominent carbonate masses on faces of peds; few fine prominent carbonate nodules; 35 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

	Bk2--44 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) extremely cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine medium and very coarse roots; common medium and few coarse irregular pores; common fine faint carbonate coats around and on the bottom surfaces rock fragments; common fine prominent carbonate masses throughout; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: 

Decross (WY) - has Bk horizons with less than 35 percent rock fragments and does not have an O horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  

Landform - Mountain sideslopes.
Elevation - 5,000 to 8,700 feet.
Slope - 8 to 65 percent.
Parent material  colluvium, alluvium and residuum derived from mixed rock sources.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 17 to 25 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 38 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Woodhall and Booneville series.  Woodhall soils are not pachic and are on upland hills, ridges, mesa and mountain side slopes.  Booneville soils are loamy-skeletal and are on concave back slopes and foot slopes of mountains and foothills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wineglass soils are used mainly for understory grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, choke cherry, common snowberry, rose, brome, bedstraw, timothy, heartleaf arnica and lupine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Wineglass soils are of small extent in south western and south central Montana. MLRA 43B
