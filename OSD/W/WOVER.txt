WOVER SERIES

The Wover series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in residuum from travertine. Wover soils are on travertine terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Histic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Wover mucky peat, 2 percent slope, in a pasture at 1,885 meters. When described on July 23, 1992 the soil was moist to 46 cm and saturated below. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oe1--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) mucky peat, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary

 Oe2--5 to 23 cm; 60 percent light gray (2.5Y 7/2) and 40 percent light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) mucky peat, 60 percent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) and 40 percent very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary

 Bg1--23 to 53 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; common fine and medium faint light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist irregularly shaped iron masses; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky parting to strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary

 Bg2--53 to 76 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) moist; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist irregularly shaped iron masses; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky parting to moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary

 Bg3--76 to 127 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/3) fine sandy loam, pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) moist; many fine and medium faint light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist irregularly shaped iron masses; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary

 Bg4--127 to 150 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/3) loamy sand, pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) moist; many medium and coarse faint light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist irregularly shaped iron masses; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4)
