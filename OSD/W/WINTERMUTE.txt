WINTERMUTE SERIES

The Wintermute series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite and slate.  Wintermute soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; about 10 miles south-southwest of Currie in Steptoe Valley; about 2,800 feet south and 2,100 feet west of the northeast corner of section 16, T. 26 N., R. 64 E.; USGS McDermid Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 07 minutes 41 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 45 minutes 33 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.1280556 latitude, -114.7591667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter through mid spring, dry late spring through fall; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to calcic horizon and horizons with firm, brittle matrix: 20 to 50 cm.

Control section - Clay content:  8 to 18 percent. 
Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 60 percent.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent, dominantly gravel.  The lower part averages 45 to 85 percent, of which 35 to 55 percent are gravel and 10 to 30 percent are cobbles and stones.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Laxal series. Laxal soils have soil temperatures of 12 to 15 degrees C and are moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wintermute soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and beach plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, and slate.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,590 to 2,080 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Automal, Eastwell, and Okan soils.  Automal soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.  Eastwell soils are shallow to duripans.  Okan soils lack calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wintermute soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, rabbitbrush, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  These soils are extensive with about 125,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  White Pine County (Western Part), Nevada, 1990.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm. (A1 and part of the A2 horizons)
Calcic horizon - The zone from 38 to 79 cm. (2Bqk1 horizon)
Duric feature - The zone from 38 to 79 cm. (2Bqk1 horizon)
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (2Bqk1 horizon and parts of the A3 and 2Bqk2 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon within 5 miles of the series type location was sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S89NV-007-004.  That pedon is a taxadjunct to the Wintermute series because it has carbonatic instead of mixed mineralogy.  It also is moderately saline and moderately sodic.  Further study of the series concept is needed to determine the dominant mineralogy class and chemical properties.
