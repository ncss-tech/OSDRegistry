WANSHIP SERIES

The Wanship series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and conglomerate.  Wanship soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wanship loam, on a linear 1 percent slope in a pasture at an elevation of 5,720 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on November 6, 1996, the soil was moist throughout with ground water at 40 inches.

    The surface is covered by a 2 inch root mat.

    A1--O to 8 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

    A2--8 to 14 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

    A3--14 to 24 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary (0 to 10 inches thick).

    2C1--24 to 26 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; common fine distinct, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and few fine faint gray (10YR 5/1) mottles; massive; soft, friable, non sticky and non plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2) clear wavy boundary (0 to 10 inches thick).

    2C2--26 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; many very fine coarse irregular pores; 50 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Summit County, Utah; about 3/4 miles west of Hoytsville; located about 1,000 feet north and 500 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 28, T. 2 N., R. 5 E.; Wanship, Utah USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 52 minutes 25 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 23 minutes 38 seconds W., NAD 1927

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime:  Xeric moisture regime 
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 47 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature:  58 to 65 degrees F.
Surface rock fragments:  0 to 15
Depth to redox concentrations: 20 to 40 inches
Depth to redox depletions:  20 to 40 inches
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  20 to 40 inches
Depth to endosaturation (in normal years): 20 to 30 inches in March through June
Rock fragment lithology: sandstone and conglomerate

Particle-size control section:  The upper part averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel; the lower part is 0 to 5 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent gravel and cobbles.

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  1 or 2 dry or moist
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent
Reaction:  Neutral to moderately alkaline

2C horizon:
Hue:  10YR to 7.5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 moist or dry
Texture (fine earth fraction):  sand or loamy sand
Rock fragments:  35 to 80 percent; gravel or cobble
Reaction:  Neutral to moderately alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.  The Upcreek soils, in a closely related family, have volcaniclastic rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Alluvium derived from sandstone and conglomerate.
Landform:  Flood plains and stream terraces.
Slopes:  0 to 3 percent
Elevation: 5,200 to 8,200 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches.
  Wettest months:  March through May.
  Driest months:  July through September.
Frost-free period:  60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dastrup, Echocreek, Kovich and Snyderville series.  
  Dastrup:  Well drained soils on fan remnants
  Echocreek and Snyderville:  Well drained soils on stream terraces
  Kovich:  Poorly drained soils on flood plains

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained, low runoff, moderate over rapid permeability.  These soils are rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of March through May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as pastureland.  In Utah this is in a semiwet fresh meadow ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Summit County, Utah, 2000; Summit Area soil survey.  The name is a small town in Summit County, Utah.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 24 inches.  (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)
Cumulic feature:  An irregular decrease in organic carbon, inferred from landscape position
Aquic conditions (endosaturation) in normal years: in the zone from 24 to 60 inches, inferred from redoximorphic features (2C1 and 2C2 horizons)
