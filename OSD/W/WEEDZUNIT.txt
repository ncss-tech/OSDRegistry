WEEDZUNIT SERIES 

The Weedzunit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from volcanic mudflow breccia. These soils are on hills, escarpments and lahars.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Weedzunit loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A1--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--7 to 11 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizon is 7 to 15 inches.) 

    Bw1--11 to 17 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  

    Bw2--17 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine and very fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 11 to 21 inches)  

    BC--24 to 29 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; common fine and very fine pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)  

    R--29 inches; volcanic mudflow breccia.
