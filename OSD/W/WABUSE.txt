WABUSE SERIES

The Wabuse series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in sandy eolian, glaciolacustrine or outwash material overlying loamy glaciolacustrine sediments. They are on glacial lake plains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, isotic, nonacid, frigid Humic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wabuse sandy loam on a linear surface of a glacial lake plain.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap-- 0 to 9 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary (4 to 10 inches thick).

    Bg1-- 9 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common medium prominent yellowish brown  (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations and common medium faint gray (2.5Y 5/1) Fe depletions; common fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

    Bg2-- 16 to 27 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loamy sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) Fe concentrations and common medium faint gray (5Y 6/1) Fe depletions; few fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

    Bg3-- 27 to 32 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) loamy coarse sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) Fe concentrations; few fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizons is 14 to 35 inches.)

    2Bg4-- 32 to 54 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam; weak medium platy structure; friable; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations and common medium faint gray (5Y 5/1) Fe depletions; few fine roots; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    2Cg-- 54 to 80 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) silt loam; massive; friable; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations and common medium faint gray (2.5Y 5/1) Fe depletions; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  St. Louis County, Minnesota; about  5 miles south and 1 mile east of  Kinney; about 1600 feet south and 1700 feet west of the northeast corner of Section 13, T. 57  N., R 19 W.  USGS Kirk, Minnesota Quadrangle; latitude 47 degrees 25 minutes 33 seconds N. and longitude 92 degrees 41 minutes 32 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The sandy mantle contains 0 to 5 percent rock fragments, that are mostly less than 5 millimeters in diameter.  Depth to carbonates is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to loamy sediments is 20 to 40 inches.

The Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.

The Bg horizon has hue of 10YR , 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.

The 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or very fine sandy loam. Thin subhorizons or strata of fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand or loam commonly occur. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.

The 2Cg horizon has hue of  2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or very fine sandy loam. Thin strata or subhorizons of loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or loam commonly occur.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wabuse soils are on concave to linear surfaces of glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in outwash, eolian or glaciolacustrine sand and the underlying glaciolacustrine loamy sediments. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches.  The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days.  Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1400 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barber, Kapla, Keenan, Vasso, and Westoo series.  Moderately well drained Keenan, somewhat poorly drained Vasso and very poorly drained Kapla soils  form a hydrosequence with the Wabuse soils. Somewhat poorly drained Barber, and moderately well drained Westoo soils do not have loamy material in the lower part of the series control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate. Wabuse soils have seasonal high saturation at a depth of  0.5 foot at some time from April through June and October through November in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested.  Some areas are used for hayland or pastureland.  Principal trees are aspen, balsam fir, white spruce and black spruce.  Native vegetation is mixed coniferous and deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA-88.  Northeastern Minnesota.  Small extent.
