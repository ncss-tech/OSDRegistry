WUPATKI SERIES

The Wupatki series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed on cinder deposits.  Wupatki soils are on hillslopes and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, shallow Haploduridic Durustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wupatki very gravelly loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common to many very fine and fine roots; about 50 to 55 percent 2 mm to   1/4 inch size cinders on surface; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick.)

    A2--1 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common to many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 to 35 percent pebble-size lime-coated cinders; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick.)

    Bk--6 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 to 60 percent pebble-size lime-coated cinders; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick.)

    2Bkqm--16 to 20 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silica-lime cemented duripan; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive with thin laminar surface and pendants on the lower surface; the cinders are black (10YR2/1); strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick.)

    2C--20 to 60 inches; very dark gray (N 3/) cinders, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grained; loose; discontinuous weakly to strongly cemented.

TYPE LOCATION:  Coconino County, Arizona; 1,900 feet east of the NW corner of sec. 7, T. 25 N., R. 8 E.; about 4 miles east and 26 miles north of Flagstaff.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to cinders:  20 - 40 inches

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some parts of July-September and December-February. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Air temperature:  52 - 55 degrees F. Rock fragments:  40 - 70 percent cinder pebbles in whole soil

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or  3 dry or moist
Texture:  GRV-L, GR-L, GRV-FSL, GR-FSL (18 - 25 percent clay)
Reaction: Slightly to moderately alkaline

B2 horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture:  GRV-L, GR-L (18 - 25 percent clay)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wupatki soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping hillslopes and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  They formed in cinder deposits.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches.  Average annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aut, Tuweep and Winona soils. Aut and Tuweep soils lack duripans.  In addition, Aut soils are moderately deep to bedrock; Tuweep soils are fine-loamy; Winona soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately permeable.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists of black grama, blue grama, galleta, needleandthread, sideoats grama, winterfat and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Arizona.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 35 & 39.
