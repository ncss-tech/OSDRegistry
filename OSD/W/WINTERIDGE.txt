WINTERIDGE SERIES

The Winteridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from shale, sandstone, siltstone and limestone rocks.  Winteridge soils are on  summits of plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Winteridge loam, on a south facing, gently undulating, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 7,300 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine, vesicular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--2 to 12 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and fine, common very fine roots; few medium, common fine and very fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Btk1--12 to 26 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and fine, common very fine roots; few fine, common very fine pores; slightly effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common fine irregular shaped masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Btk2--26 to 45 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few fine, many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, 11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common fine irregular shaped masses; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 19 inches thick)

    Bk--45 to 60 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent, 52 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as many fine irregular shaped masses; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 3 miles northeast of the confluence of Willow Creek and Meadow Creek; located about 1,500 feet east and 1,100 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 22, T. 15 S., R. 21 E., SLBM; Tenmile Canyon North USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 29 minutes 36 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 33 minutes 20 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  44 to 46 degrees F.
Depth to calcic horizon: 12 to 18 inches
The combination of colors and thickness does not meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon

Particle size control section (weighted average):  18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 fine sand or coarser

A horizon:
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist 

Bt horizon:
Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 to 5 dry or moist
Texture:  loam or clay loam

Btk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 to 5 dry or moist
Texture: loam or clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  3 to 15 percent 

Bk horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 6 to 8 moist
Chroma:  1 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Texture:  silt loam, loam, or clay loam
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  30 to 50 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no current competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from shale, sandstone, siltstone and limestone rocks
Landform:   summits on plateaus
Slopes:  1 to 8 percent
Elevation: 6,500 to 8,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  12 to 16 inches
Frost-free period:  90 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Moonset, Utso, Seeprid, Towave, and Whetrock series.  These soils are all on hillslopes.

Moonset soils are shallow.

Towave and Whetrock soils have a mollic epipedon and are skeletal.

Seeprid and Utso soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Potential native vegetation is basin big sagebrush, thickspike wheatgrass, needleandthread, muttongrass and globemallow.  These soils have been correlated to Upland Loam (Basin Big Sagebrush) - 034XY306UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.
