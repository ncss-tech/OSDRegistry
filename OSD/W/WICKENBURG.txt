WICKENBURG SERIES

The Wickenburg series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium-colluvium. Wickenburg soils are on pediment hillslopes and mountain slopes with gradients of 1 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Wickenburg gravelly sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 1 inch; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

     Bw--1 to 12 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 40 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 16 inches thick)

     2Cr--12 to 60 inches; partially weathered granitic rock (grus); common very fine roots; few thin clay films coating bedrock and in fractures; fine lime coatings in fractures. (30 to 60 inches or more thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Maricopa County, Arizona; 2400 feet east and 2100 feet south of the NW corner of section 29, T. 7 N., R. 5 W.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wickenburg soils are on pediment hillslopes and mountain slopes with gradients of 1 to 65 percent. They formed in alluvium-colluvium from granitic rock and minor areas of volcanic rock.  Elevation is 1800 to 4000 feet. The climate is warm and semiarid continental. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain. Mean annual temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 220 to 275 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the similar Cellar and Lehmans soils, these are the Dixaleta and Gran soils. Gran soils have argillic horizons and Dixaleta soils lack cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazing. The present vegetation is ironwood, paloverde, shrubby buckwheat, catclaw, yucca, triangle bursage, saguaro, ocotillo, graythorn, canotia, bush muhly and range ratany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Arizona. The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 40.
