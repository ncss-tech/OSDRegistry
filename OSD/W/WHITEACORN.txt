WHITEACORN SERIES

The WHITEACORN series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from granite. These soils are on eroded fan remnants and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 425 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Inceptic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Whiteacorn sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 13 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 14 cm thick).

    Bt--8 to 36 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and few medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 2 percent faint clay bridges between sand grains; 13 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 35 cm thick).

    C1--36 to 60 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; massive; friable, slightly hard, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0). (5 to 40 cm thick).

    C2--60 to 200 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very gravelly loamy sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3), moist; massive; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).
