WEINGART SERIES

The Weingart series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum weathered from semiconsolidated shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0318, MT0363.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  albic horizon - from the soil surface to 2 inches which is also the ochric epipedon (E horizon); argillic horizon - from 2 to 13 inches which is also the particle size control section (Btn1, Btn2 horizons); accumulation of lime - from 13 to 21 inches (Bkn horizon); accumulation of gypsum and other salts - from 21 to 35 inches (Bknyz, Bnyz horizons); paralithic contact - at a depth of 35 inches (Cr horizon).  Weingart soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
