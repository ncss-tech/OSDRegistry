WHITORE SERIES 

The Whitore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, or alpine till derived mainly from limestone, calcareous shale, marly shale, or calcareous sandstone and siltstone. These soils are on alluvial fans, till plains, moraines, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Typic Calcicryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Whitore channery loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A--2 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine and medium pores; 25 percent channers; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear irregular boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bw--5 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine pores; 25 percent channers; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bk1--14to 25 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very channery loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots (some forming horizontal root mats on rock fragments); 50 percent channers; common distinct calcium carbonate casts on surface and pendants on undersides of rock fragments, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 27 inches thick) 

    Bk2--25 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) extremely channery loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots (some forming horizontal root mats on rock fragments); 60 percent channers; many distinct calcium carbonate casts on surface and pendants on underside of rock fragments, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary.

USE AND VEGETATION: Whitore soils are used for timber production, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, limber pine, and aspen.  The understory vegetation is kinnikinnick, pinegrass, aster, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, and blue huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Whitore soils are of large extent on the eastern front of the northern Rocky Mountains and in west-central Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B, 46.
