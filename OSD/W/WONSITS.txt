WONSITS SERIES

The Wonsits series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone rocks.  Wonsits soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, siliceous, frigid Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wonsits sandy loam on 2 percent southeast facing slopes under rangeland at an elevation of 6,005 feet.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Slightly decomposing leaves and grass blades cover the surface.

    2C1--20 to 30 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very cobbly loamy sand; brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine, few medium interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; many medium and coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear irregular boundary.  (10 to 26 inches thick)

    2C2--30 to 45 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; common medium and coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 18 inches thick)

    2C3--45 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; common medium and coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) redoximorphic concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 1 mile southwest of Whiterocks along the Uintah River; about 1,100 feet east, 650 feet north of the southwest corner sec. 24, T.1N., R.1W., USBM; USGS Whiterocks, Utah quadrangle; 40 degrees, 27 minutes, 49 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 57 minutes, 01 seconds west longitude.  NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in the late summer and fall.  Ustic moisture regime
Mean annual soil temperature: 44 to 47 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 67 to 70 degrees F.
Depth to endosaturation: 10 to 20 inches to meltwater induced saturation during the months of March through July
Flooding: frequent occurrence, very long duration between March and July
Depth to lithologic discontinuity: 16 to 24 inches to layers with greater than 35 percent rock fragments
Mollic epipedon: 16 to 24 inches thick

Particle-size control section (weighted average):0 to 10 percent clay, with content of rounded gravel, cobbles and stones ranging from 0 to 15 percent in the upper one-third of the particle-sized control section and from 50 to 75 percent in the lower two-thirds, with the entire particle-size control section averaging 40 to 55 percent rounded gravel, cobbles and stones.

A horizon:
Texture: sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay in the upper part, and loamy sand with 0 to 5 percent clay in the lower part
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel, cobbles or stones
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline. 

2C horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4 or 5
Texture:  loamy sand or sand, with 0 to 5 percent clay, modified by 50 to 75 percent gravel, cobbles and stones
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wonsits soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone rocks.  Elevation ranges from 5,900 to 6,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hominy and Gooseneck soils.  Hominy soils are on structural benches and fan remnants and are somewhat excessively drained and do not have mollic epipedons.  Gooseneck soils are on flood plains and do not have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very low runoff;  rapid permeability. depth to a high water table ranges from 10 to 20 inches during the months of March through July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for livestock grazing.  Potential vegetation consists of river birch, willows, alder, narrowleaf cottonwoods, rushes, sedges and goldenrod. This soil has been correlated to the Semiwet Streambank (Birch-Alder) 047CY003UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Utah; LRR E, MLRA 47.  The series is of small extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (A2, A3, 2C1, and 2C2 horizon)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from the surface to a depth of 20 inches (A1, A2, and A3)
Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2C1 horizon.
Redoximorphic concentrations: In the entire profile.
Endosaturation: The zone of meltwater induced saturation at 10 to 20 inches from the surface during the months of March through July.

The frigid soil temperature regime is a result of the influence of cold mountain water and cool air drainage in this area considered typically mesic.

The particle-size classification was based on the weighted average of the entire 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section.

The classification was changed from Cumulic Haploborolls to frigid Cumulic Haplustolls 12/98
