WAYNECO SERIES

The Wayneco series consists of shallow, well drained moderately permeable soils formed in eolian deposits, colluvium and residuum from interbedded sandstone siltstone and shale. These soils are on mesas, benches, and hillsides have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Wayneco fine sand on a 4 percent undulating slope in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

       A--0 to 3 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grained; loose; very few fine roots; slightly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick.)

       Bw--3 to 9 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few fine roots; few fine and medium pores; strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) clear wavy boundary. (0 to 9 inches thick.)

       Bk--9 to 19 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; very few fine pores; strongly calcareous; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick.)

       R--19 inches; sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Garfield County, Utah; SW 1/4, sec. 27, T. 31 S., R. 13 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The SMCS is usually dry, in all parts, 105 to 160 cumulative days from April through October. It is usually moist, in some part, 50 to 105 days during the same periods. It is intermittently moist is some part November through April. The period of maximum precipitation is July through October. The soil is driest during May and June. Ustic aridic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 52 to 56 degrees F.

Depth to bedrock: 10 to 20 inches

Particle size control section:

Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent in the profile

Hue: 7.5YR, 5YR, 2.5YR

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4 to 8, dry or moist

Bw and Bk horizons
Value: 4 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma: 4 to 8, dry or moist
Texture: loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam with 18 percent or less clay
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Drymesa (T) (UT), Pacon(T) (UT)Petaca (NM), Pinon (NM), and Shalako (UT) series.  Drymesa soils have mean annual soil temperature lower than 52 degrees F. and are in MLRA 34B-Wam Central Desertic Basins and Plains. Petaca soils are derived from volcanic material and have 10YR hue.  Pacon and Pinon soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Shalako soils have 10YR or 2.5Y hues.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wayneco soils are on mesas, benches and hillsides at elevations of 5,000 to 6,700 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. These soils formed in eolian deposits, colluvium and residuum from interbedded sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Mespun and Mivida soils. Mespun and Mivida soils lack bedrock above depths of 40 inches. Mespun also has a sandy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate to moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation. The potential vegetation is blackbrush, Mormon-tea, winterfat and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Utah. These soils are of moderate extent. MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Garfield County, Utah, 1985. The name is coined from one of the counties in the survey area.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 9 to 19 inches (Bk horizon)

Lithic contact  the boundary at 19 inches (R horizon)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010

Updates and revisions for the correlation of Navajo Mountain Area (AZ711), July 9, 2008, CEM

Updated for the correlation of the Emery Area, Utah. Air and soil temperatures were adjusted to account for the differences between MLRA 34B and 35. Soils correlated as Wayneco in Utah have cooler air and soil temperatures and should be evaluated. April 2011 CEM.
