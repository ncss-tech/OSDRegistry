WILLISTON SERIES

The Williston series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in moderately thick beds of clayey marine sediments overlying soft limestone.  They are on nearly level to sloping upland landscapes in the Coastal Plain.  Water runs off the surface moderately rapidly.  Slope is dominantly less than 5 percent but ranges up to 8 percent on hillsides.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Williston loamy fine sand on a gentle slope, in forest.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 6 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loamy fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

     AB--6 to 12 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

     Bt1--12 to 18 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy clay loam; common medium distinct dark red (10YR 3/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few distinct discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; strong clay bridging between sand grains; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

     Bt2--18 to 29 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay; common medium prominent dark red (10YR 3/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few distinct discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; strong clay bridging between sand grains; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

     Bt3--29 to 37 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; mildly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

     2Cr--37 inches; white (10YR 8/1) weathered limestone soft enough to be cut with a spade; common hard limestone boulders.

TYPE LOCATION:  Hernando County, Florida.  About 1.75 miles north of the junction of U. S. Highway 98 and Florida Highway 491 and 0.5 mile west of Highway 491.  SW1/4NE1/4 sec. 12, T. 21 S., R. 18 E.

RANGE IN CHARATERISTICS:  Depth to soft limestone is highly variable within short distances but dominately ranges from 20 to 40 inches.

The A or Ap horizon has color in hue 10YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 1 or 2.  The AB horizon color is in hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6, chroma of 3 or 4; or value of 5, chroma of 5 or 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

The BA horizon is in some pedons.  Where present, it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam 2 to 5 inches thick and has colors like the AB horizon; and in addition, hue 7.5YR, value of 5, chroma of 5 or 6.  The Bt horizon has color in hue 10YR, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 3 through 8; hue 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 4 through 8; or hue 5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture of the Bt1 horizon is sandy clay loam and of the Bt2 and Bt3 horizon sandy clay or clay.  Weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt2 horizon is 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction of the Bt1 horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral and of the Bt2 and Bt3 horizon from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.

The 2Cr horizon is soft limestone in hue 10YR, value of 7 or 8, chroma of 1 or 2 mixed with a few to common hard limestone boulders.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Archer, Bushnell, Hague, Micanopy, Pedro, and Zuber series.  Archer soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 72 degrees F.  Bushnell and Micanopy soils have mottles with chroma 2 or less within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Bushnell soils have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick, loamy texture, and siliceous mineralogy.  Pedro soils have loamy texture, siliceous mineralogy and shallow depth to limestone.  Zuber soils have a solum more than 60 inches deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Williston soils are on nearly level to sloping upland landscapes in the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in moderately thick beds of clayey marine sediments overlying limestone.  Near the type location, rainfall averages about 55 inches annually with mean annual air temperature of more than 73 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Micanopy series and the Kendrick series.  Kendrick soils have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick, solum more than 60 inches thick, and low base saturation.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Williston soils are well drained.  They have moderately rapid runoff and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas remain in native forest vegetation of laurel, live and water oaks, hickory, magnolia, sweetgum, dogwood, redbud, and longleaf, loblolly, and slash pine.  Understory vegetation consists of chalky bluestem, hairy panicum, greenbriar, blackberry, and numerous forbes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Florida, primarily on the Ocala Uplift from Pasco County through Alachua County.  The series is of small extent.
