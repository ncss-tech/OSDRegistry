WINKEL SERIES

The Winkel series are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained formed in calcareous residuum weathered from basalt, limestone, and eolian sands. Winkel soils are on mesa tops, plateaus and mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Calcic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Winkel very gravelly fine sandy loam  rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; 40 percent pebbles and cobbles; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--1 to 6 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; 40 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 5 to 10 inches.)

    Bk1--6 to 12 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; 40 percent pebbles and cobbles; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--12 to 16 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very cobbly fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive, soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; 60 percent pebble and cobble size pan fragments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 6 to 12 inches.)

    Bkm--16 to 20 inches; indurated petrocalcic horizon..

TYPE LOCATION: Washington County, Utah; 1 3/4 miles North and l mile east of St. George, Utah; in the NW 1/4 of section 17, T.42 S., R.15 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part during winter and spring and intermittingly moist in the upper part following summer convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime. 

Soil temperature: Estimated to range from 59 to 63 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 77 to 82 degrees F.

Depth to calcic horizon: 5 to 10 inches.

Depth to petrocalcic horizon: 11 to 19 inches.

Depth to bedrock: 20 to 40 inches.

Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Control section: Clay content: 8 to 20 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 75 percent.

A horizon
Hue: 5YR to 10YR.
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 6, dry or moist.
Texture:  Very gravely fine sandy loam or gravelly loam.
Effervescence: Strongly or violently.

Bk horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR.
Value: 4 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist.
Rock fragments:  20 to 85 percent gravel and cobble with the highest amounts in the lower part of the profile.
Texture:  Dominantly gravelly to very cobbly fine sandy loam but ranges to very gravelly and cobbly loam.
Effervescence:  Strongly or violently.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Delnorte (TX), Delthorny (AZ), Splotter (NM), and Yurm (NV) series.  Delnorte soils are located in MLRA 42 and have dominant hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 3 or less and formed in deep alluvial material weathered from granite and other igneous rocks.  Delthorny soils have hardpans as shallow as 6 inches.  Splotter soils are located in MLRA 42 and do not have 5YR hue.  Yurm soils do not include 5YR or 7.5YR hue. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winkel soils are on mesa tops, plateaus and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,400 to 4,100 feet. Soils in Arizona should be re-evaluated for soil temperature below 2,500 feet from cool thermic (59 to 63 degrees F.) to warm thermic (64 to 71 degrees F.) or hyperthermic. Slopes dominantly are 1 to 10 percent and range from 1 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous residuum weathered from basalt, limestone, and eolian sands.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  Frost-free period is about 180 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bermesa, Curhollow, Harrisburg, and Pastura soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium and very high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is creosotebush, buckwheat, galleta, blackbrush, Mormon tea, winterfat, and cholla cactus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Utah, southern Nevada and northern Arizona; MLRA 30.  These soils are moderately extensive.  

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, Utah; 1972.

REMARKS:  The classification was changed from Typic Paleorthids to Calcic Petrocalcids in 9/94.
In Utah this series is correlated with Desert range sites.
