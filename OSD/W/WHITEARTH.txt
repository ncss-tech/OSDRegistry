WHITEARTH SERIES

The Whitearth series consists of very deep, well drained, sodium-affected soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Natrixeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Whitearth silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Btn--5 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on ped faces and in pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bkn--9 to 32 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; hard, fine, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few distinct masses of lime; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 24 inches thick).

    C1--32 to 49 inches; white (10YR 8/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine tubular pores; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 18 inches thick)

    C2--49 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

COMPETING SERIES:

Thatcherflats (ID) - have a water table at depths of 3 to 4 feet; are somewhat poorly drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and dissected lake plains.

Elevation - 2,500 to 3,000 feet.

Slope - 0 to 8 percent.

Parent material - silty alluvium derived from lacustrine deposits.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist falls and springs; warm, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls as rain or snow in late fall through late spring.

Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 105 to 125 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability in the Bt and Bk horizons and moderately slow permeability below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Whitearth soils are used mainly for rangeland and pastureland.  The potential native vegetation is basin wildrye, Nuttall alkaligrass, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Whitearth soils are of small extent in mountain valleys of northwestern Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1986.  Whitearth is a coined name.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1049.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 5 inches (Ap horizon); a natric horizon from 5 to 32 inches (Btn and Bkn horizons).  Whitearth soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime bordering on aridic.
