WILE SERIES

The Wile series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granitic bedrock. They are on south and west facing mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, mesic, shallow Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wile gravelly sandy loam, woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and fine roots; common fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel: neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bt1--18 to 30 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse and many medium and fine roots; common medium and fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on peds and lining pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--30 to 46 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse and common medium and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many prominent clay bridges between mineral grains; 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.(10 to 18 cm thick)

    Cr--46 cm; soft, weathered granite; clay coatings and some roots extending into fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada; about 2 miles southeast of Lobdell Peak; 3,000 feet due north of Lobdell summit; 1,700 feet south and 1,000 feet west of projected northeast corner of section 10, T. 9 N., R. 25 E.; USGS Mount Etna 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 39 minutes 27 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 10 minutes 10 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.6583333 latitude, -119.1691667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in mid June to October; xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.  
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 9 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 23 cm.
Depth to weathered bedrock: 30 to 50 cm.
Depth to hard bedrock: Deeper than 100 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly acid.

Particle-size control section - Clay content - 35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments: 20 to 35 percent fine gravel.

A horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.

Bt horizons
Hue: l0YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 4 or 5.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barbermill, Delma and Hyloc soils.  

Barbermill soils have an abrupt textural change at 8 to 25 cm in depth and are not dominated by fine gravel.  Delma and Hyloc soils have less than l0 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wile soils are on south and west facing plane or convex mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic bedrock.  Elevations are 2,073 to 2,400 meters.   The mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm.  Frost-free season is 80 to ll0 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Berit and Minneha soils.  They both have more than 35 percent rock fragments and less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; slow permeability; moderately high or moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for woodland, wildlife habitat, and for limited grazing. Native vegetation is pinyon-juniper woodland with an understory of low sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Thurber needlegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. The soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
