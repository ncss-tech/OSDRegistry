WHITETOP SERIES

The Whitetop series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from weakly consolidated ash.  These soils are on shoulders, summits, and upper backslopes of hills.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy, frigid, shallow Vitrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Whitetop ashy fine sandy loam, rangeland; on 20 percent northwest facing slopes at 6,200 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) ashy fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 5 percent parachannery; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) parachannery ashy fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 20 percent parachanners; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Cr--16 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) weakly consolidated ash.

TYPE LOCATION: Bear Lake County, Idaho; about 2 miles west of Bennington, Idaho; about 550 feet north and 1,500 feet west of the southeast corner of section 1, T. 12 S., R. 43 E. (42 degrees 24 minutes 9.6 seconds North Latitude and 111 degrees 22 minutes 20.6 seconds West Longitude)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: summits, shoulders and upper backslopes of hills in the Salt Lake Formation.
Elevation: 5,850 to 7,000 feet
Slope: 8 to 45 percent
Parent Material: residuum from weakly consolidated ash
Climate: long, cool winters; dry, warm summers
Average annual precipitation: 15 to 22 inches
Average annual temperature: 39 to 45 degrees  
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crossley, Cadero (T), and Burchert (T) soils.  Crossley soils are on summits, have a lithic contact and a light colored surface.  Cadero soils are on the same landscape positions, on north-facing aspects and are moderately deep to weakly consolidated ash.  Burchert soils are on backslopes and shoulders and are moderately deep to weakly consolidated ash with mixed alluvium in the upper part.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat and rangeland.  The dominant native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, serviceberry, mountain snowberry, buckwheat, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sanberg bluegrass, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The series is not extensive.  MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana
