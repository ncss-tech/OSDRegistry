WEYMOUTH SERIES

The Weymouth series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous, loamy and clayey alluvium and/or colluvium over dense, noncemented mudstone bedrock of Permian or Triassic age. These gently to strongly sloping soils occur on side slopes of hillslopes on dissected plains. Slope range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is high on slopes of 1 to 5 percent and very high on slopes over 5 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cropland and native rangeland. Some gently sloping areas are mainly farmed.  Small grain and sorghum are the principal crops. Rangeland vegetation is mostly sideoats and bluegrama and in the drier areas buffalograss and hairy grama. Widely spaced mesquite trees or shrubs occur on most areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Land Resource Region H-Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; MLRAs - 78B and 78C (Central Rolling Red Plains). This series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Potter County, Texas; 1929.

REMARKS: 
Edited 11/2015 (RFG-CJV): Series classification changed from Typic Haplustepts in order to recognize a calcic horizon. Almost all descriptions in published Soil Survey manuscripts are described like calcic horizons. Changed to tabular format. Added metric measurements. Updated horizon range in characteristics, competing series lists, geographically associated soil, and geographic setting.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in). (Parts of Bw horizon and Bk horizon)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in). (A horizon)
Cambic horizon: 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in). (Bw horizon)
Identifiable secondary carbonates: 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in). (Bw and Bk horizons)
Calcic horizon: 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in). (Bk horizon)
Densic contact: The contact with claystone or shale at 76 cm (30 in). (Cd horizon)

Underlying material - Most clods slake in water in less than 1 hour. This material can be dug with a light duty backhoe.
