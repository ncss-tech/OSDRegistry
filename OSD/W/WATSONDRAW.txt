WATSONDRAW SERIES

The Watsondraw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants and hills.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 560 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Eutric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Watsondraw gravelly sandy loam, in forestland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oe--0 to 4 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 10 centimeters thick)

    A--4 to 8 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) gravelly sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and common medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 10 centimeters thick)

    E--8 to 51 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and common medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 50 centimeters thick)

    Bt1--51 to 94 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very cobbly sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; somewhat hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and common medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 35 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 25 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 60 centimeters thick)

    Bt2--94 to 137 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) gravelly sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; somewhat hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 75 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 50 centimeters thick)

    BC--137 to 200 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; somewhat hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
