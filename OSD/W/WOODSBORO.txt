SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Refugio County, Texas, 2009.  The name is from a community in Refugio County

REMARKS:  These soils were originally included in the Narta series.  The Narta soils are located at elevations less than 6 m (20 ft) above sea level along the Texas Gulf Coast in MLRA 150B and are subject to flooding due to storm surge during tropical disturbances.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 15 to 65 cm (6 to 26 in).  (Btn1 and Btn2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in).  (A horizons) 
Natric horizon: 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in.  (Btng1, Btng2, Btng3, Btkn1, Btkn2, Btkn3, Btkn4 horizons)
Vertic features: Linear extensibility is greater than 6 from 15 to 81 cm (6 to 32 in).  (Btn1, Btn2, and Btn3 horizons)
Episaturation:  The zone of saturation from 0 to 81 cms (0 to 32 in.  (A, Btn1, Btn2, Btn3 horizons)
Aquic conditions: 0 to 81 cm (0 to 32 in) during the spring and fall months of the year.
