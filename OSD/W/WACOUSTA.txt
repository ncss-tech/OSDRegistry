WACOUSTA SERIES

The Wacousta series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine sediments. These soils are in broad depressions and swales on till plains, moraines, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters

Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second
Ponding--frequently ponded for long duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
Where drained, these areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, and small grain. Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture. The native vegetation is herbaceous marsh species tolerant of excessive wetness such as, cattails, bulrushes, giant burreed, giant reed grass and hydrophytic sedges.

Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic sections--Western lake section and Eastern lake section

LRR M;--central and north-central Iowa, south-central Minnesota, and southern Wisconsin
Extent--moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt County, Iowa, 1958.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 43 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 64 centimeters (Bg horizon);
aquic moisture regime.

The type location was moved because the previous location had been disturbed. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
