WICUP SERIES

The Wicup series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff with a component of loess.  Wicup soils are on pediments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wicup silty clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 30 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brownscombe, Bucklake, Cagle, Correco, Holmzie, Jasseek, Northmore, Perla, Schoer, Sherar, and Zymans series.

Brownscombe soils have more than 15 percent coarse sand and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section and do not have secondary carbonates within 76 cm.  Bucklake and Perla soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Cagle and Holmzie soils do not have secondary carbonates.  Correco, Jasseek, Northmore, and Schoer soils are very deep.  Sherar soils have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with more than 35 percent rock fragments and do not have secondary carbonates.  Zymans soils are deep and very deep to paralithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wicup soils are on pediments and hills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff with a component of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 1,955 mm.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Akler, Booford, Gochea, and Gumble soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wicup soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, and thickspike wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 25.
