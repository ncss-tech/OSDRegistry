WAUCOMA SERIES

The Waucoma series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in 100 to more than 150 centimeters of glacial drift with or without a thin layer of residuum or a reddish paleosol overlying limestone bedrock.  These soils are on summits and back slopes on uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Waucoma loam, on a northwest-facing, linear slope of about 4 percent, in a deciduous forest, at an elevation of about 335 meters above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Winneshiek County, Iowa, 1970.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 43 to 94 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 140 centimeters (A, E, BE, Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 centimeters (A and E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 43 to 140 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
lithic contact--the contact with limestone bedrock at 140 centimeters;
udic moisture regime.

The upper 0.3 to 1.5 meters of limestone may be significantly fractured and may not be a root restrictive layer.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
