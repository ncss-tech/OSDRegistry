TYPICAL PEDON:  Warminster silt loam - on a 4 percent slope in a fescue and orchardgrass pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil.)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; yellowish red (2.5YR 5/6) clay loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; 2 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick.)

    Bt1--8 to 38 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm, sticky, plastic; few fine and medium roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 2 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--38 to 45 inches; red (2.5YR 4/8) clay; moderate, fine subangular blocky structure; firm, sticky, plastic; few fine roots; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 30 to 50 inches.)

    C--45 to 55 inches; red (2.5YR 4/8) clay loam; massive; friable, sticky, plastic; few fine roots; 5 percent gravel; few fine flakes of mica; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick.)

    Cr--55 to 72 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) slightly weathered shale that crushes to loam; 5 percent gravel; few fine flakes of mica.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nelson County, Virginia; about 2.1 miles east (76 degrees) of the intersection of highways VA-604 and VA-626 and 1.9 miles south (200 degrees) of the intersection of highways VA-644 and VA-626.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Nelson County, Virginia, 1988.

REMARKS:  This soil was previously mapped as Totier, a thermic soil, and Warminster was established as a mesic counterpart.  Albemarle County, VA, where Totier was established, has since been redesignated to be correlated with a mesic temperature regime.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 45 inches (Bt horizons)
Paralithic contact-55 inches (Cr horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 65 inches
