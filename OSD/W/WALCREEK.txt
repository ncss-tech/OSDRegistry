SERIES PROPOSED: Wake County, North Carolina, 2025

Walcreek name taken from the Walnut Creek Greenway which is a large greenbelt that runs from Lake Johnson Park located in Cary, NC to southeastern Raleigh, NC. 

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 13 centimeters 0 to 5 inches) 
Human-transported materials--The zone from 0 to 150 centimeters (0 to 60 inches)
Particle-size control section--The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)

Some pedons may have redoximorphic features below a depth of 100 centimeters in the intact native subsoil and would be included in the concept as related to the thickness of human-transported materials.
