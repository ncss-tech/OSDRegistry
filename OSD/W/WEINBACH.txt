WEINBACH SERIES

The Weinbach series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils with fragipans formed in old acid alluvium of stratified silt loam, silty clay loam, and loam with some sand in the underlying materials.  These soils are on terraces and slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Aeric Fragiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Weinbach silt loam - on a nearly level convex slope in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

   E--8 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; few fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) mottles; moderate coarse granular structure; friable; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

   BEg--15 to 23 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; many medium faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) and gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common mica flakes; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (7 to 16 inches thick)

   Btxg1--23 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; common fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; strong coarse prismatic structure; very firm; brittle, compact; thin continuous gray (10YR 6/1) clay films and few gray silt coatings on faces of peds; few black (10YR 2/1) accumulations of iron and manganese oxides; common fine mica flakes; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

   Btxg2--31 to 40 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam; many distinct coarse dark brown (10YR 4/3) mottles; strong very coarse prismatic structure; very firm; brittle, compact; thin continuous gray (10YR 6/1) clay films on faces of peds; few black (10YR 2/1) accumulations of iron and manganese oxides; common fine mica flakes; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of Btx horizon is 11 to 30 inches.)

   BC--40 to 52 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure; firm; few thin brown (10YR 5/3) silt films on faces of prisms; thin discontinuous grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on few faces of peds; few black (10YR 2/1) accumulations of iron and manganese oxides; common fine mica flakes; very strongly acid; diffuse smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

   C--52 to 65 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) stratified silty clay loam; massive; firm; few light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt films along cleavage planes; common fine mica flakes; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Perry County, Indiana; 1/2 mile north of Tell City; 1200 feet east and 300 feet north of the southwest corner, sec. 20, T.  6 S., R. 3 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches.

The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is commonly silt loam and less commonly loam.  It is neutral to very strongly acid.  In a few areas where the soil is undisturbed there is a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) A horizon, 1 to 3 inches thick.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is silt loam and less commonly loam.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid.

The BE horizon or BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 and is mottled.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.

The Btx horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 and is mottled.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6 and is mottled.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is stratified and layers range from silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, and clay loam to sand.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Avonburg, Bartle, Doles, Dubois, Platea, and Wadsworth series.  Avonburg soils have coarse fragments in the lower part of the solum and have a lower B horizon formed in till.  Bartle soils contain less clay in the fragipan horizon and have grayer Btx and C horizons.  Doles soils do not have mica flakes in the solum.  Dubois soils lack mica flakes in the solum and are formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess and the underlying stratified materials.  Platea soils have 2 to 20 percent coarse fragments in the solum, are less acid, and formed in till strongly influenced by clayey shale and siltstone.  Wadsworth soils contain less silt in the sola and have C horizons of glacial till that commonly contains free carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weinbach soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The Weinbach soils formed in old acid alluvium of stratified silt loam, silty clay loam, and loam with some sand in the underlying materials.  These materials are largely derived from shale, sandstone, and quartzite.  In places the material contains a component of glacial drift and possibly some loess.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The somewhat poorly drained Weinbach soils are in a drainage sequence with the Wheeling, Sciotoville, Ginat, and Chilo soils.  Wheeling soils are well drained and are on broad flats and side slopes where the area is dissected.  Sciotoville soils are moderately well drained and are on nearly level and gently sloping areas.  Ginat soils are poorly drained and are on the level areas.  Chilo soils are very poorly drained and are in the narrow slightly concave areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is very slow.  Normally this soil does not flood.  In some areas flooding is rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Largely cropped to corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay.  A small part is in permanent pasture, idle, or in forest.  The original vegetation was mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Allegheny Plateau of Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, southern Ohio, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, and northern Kentucky.  The soil is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 15 inches (Ap,E horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 15 to 40 inches (BEg, Btxg1, Btxg2 horizons); fragipan - the zone from approximately 23 to 40 inches (Btxg1, Btxg2 horizons); aquic moisture regime.
