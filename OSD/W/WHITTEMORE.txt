WHITTEMORE SERIES

The Whittemore series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are shallow to ortstein. Whittemore soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid, shallow, ortstein Typic Duraquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Whittemore sand, from an area of Whittemore-Springport complex, 0 to 3 percent slopes. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[Combined thickness of the Bw2 and Bw3 horizons is 0 to 28 cm (11 inches).]

 2Bt--89 to 112 cm (35 to 44 inches); light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) silty clay; strong coarse angular blocky structure parting to strong medium and fine angular blocky; firm; common distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay films; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; many fine and medium prominent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) iron depletions; about 1 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 2C--112 to 203 cm (44 to 80 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay; massive with widely spaced vertical fractures; firm; few fine white (10YR 8/1) carbonate coatings; common coarse prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; many medium prominent gray (N 6/) iron depletions; about 1 percent rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Finch, McIvor, and Spot series. Finch and McIvor soils have more than 99 cm (39 inches) of sandy material in the upper part of the series control section. Spot soils have a seasonal high water table within a foot of the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whittemore soils are on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Whittemore soils are associated with the poorly drained Springport and Wakeley soils, the somewhat poorly drained Manary soils, and the competing McIvor soils. Manary soils do not have spodic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 91 cm (1 to 3 feet) between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on slope gradient and depth to the clayey material. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material; moderately high or high in the ortstein material; and low in the clayey material. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy material, moderate or moderately rapid in the ortstein material and very slow in the underlying clayey material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Only a small portion of this soil has been cleared. It is used mainly for woodland. Woodlands consist of mixed northern hardwoods, pines, and eastern hemlock.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northeastern lower Michigan. The series is of small extent.
