WEMPLE SERIES

The Wemple series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits, alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants and hillslopes. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls
