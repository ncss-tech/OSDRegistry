WILDMOUNT SERIES

The Wildmount series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in slope alluvuim and colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite rocks.  Wildmount soils are on mountain slopes and fan remnants.  Slopes are 25 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wildmount extremely stony loam on a southeast facing, concave, 25 percent slope under pinyon pine and Utah juniper at an elevation of 6,050 feet.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; 40 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent gravel on the surface; 10 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 15 percent gravel within the horizon; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 14 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very cobbly loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, common fine, few medium tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; 5 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, and 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk1--14 to 23 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very cobbly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common fine nodules and thin coatings on rock fragments; 5 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear irregular boundary.

    Bk2--23 to 32 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very cobbly loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as common medium and fine irregular shaped soft masses and thin coatings on rock fragments; 15 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk3--32 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very cobbly loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and common roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as thin coatings on rock fragments; 15 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 1 mile northwest of Jones Hole Springs on USGS Jones Hole Quadrangle; about 200 feet west and 2,220 feet south of the northeast corner of Sec. 35, T.2S., R.25E., SLBM; 40 degrees, 36 minutes, 15 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 04 minutes, 10 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in the late summer and fall.  Aridic Ustic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 44 to 47 degrees F.
Depth to cambic horizon: 2 to 8 inches
Depth to calcic horizon: 11 to 14 inches

Particle size control section (weighted average): 18 to 27 
percent clay.

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6 dry or moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 to 5 dry or moist
Texture: very cobbly loam or very stony loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Bk horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6
Texture: very cobbly loam or very cobbly sandy clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: Current competitors are the Tabyago and Yampa series.  A competitor prior to the Seventh Edition, 1996 Keys to Soil Taxonomy is the Bronec series.

Bronec soils have hue more yellow than 7.5YR.

Tabyago soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.

Yampa soils have 5 to 10 percent clay in the lower part of 
the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite rocks
Landform:  mountain slopes, fan remnants
Slopes:  25 to 50 percent 
Elevation:  6,500 to 7,300 feet 
Mean annual temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  12 to 16 inches
Frost-free period:  90 to 100 days
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abracon, Cortyzack, Diagulch, and Honlu soils.  The Abracon and Honlu soils are on hillslopes and are fine-loamy.  Cortyzack and Diagulch soils have mollic epipedons, are fine-loamy and are on plateau summits.  In addition Cortyzack soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential vegetation consists of pinyon pine, Utah juniper, bluebunch wheatgrass, and birchleaf mountainmahogany.  This soil has been correlated to the Upland Stony Loam (Pinyon-Utah Juniper) 047XY335UT at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  The series is of small extent.  The name is coined.  LRR E, MLRA 47.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bw, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 14 inches.  (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 14 to 60 inches.  (Bk horizons)

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

The classification was changed from Haplocalcidic Ustochrepts to Aridic Calciustepts 12/98.
