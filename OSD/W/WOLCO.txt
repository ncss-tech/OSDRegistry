WOLCO SERIES

  The Wolco series is a member of the fine, mixed, thermic family
 of Pachic Argiustolls.  These soils have a dark gray silty clay
 loam A horizon, a very dark grayish brown silty clay loam B1
 horizon, and coarsely mottled brownish or reddish silty clay B2t
 horizons that are underlain by hard limestone at a depth of 55
 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Pachic Argiustolls

  TYPICAL PEDON:  Wolco silty clay loam - rangeland.
                   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise
 stated.)

      A1   --  0-14 inches, dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam,
 black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard,
 friable; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (9 to 17 inches
 thick)

      B1   --  14-21 inches, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)
 silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium
 subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium granular
 structure; very hard, firm; slightly acid; gradual smooth
 boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

      B21t --  21-36 inches, coarsely mottled brown (7.5YR 5/2),
 yellowish red (5YR 5/6), and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty
 clay, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2), yellowish red (5YR 4/6), and very
 dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium blocky
 structure parting to strong medium granular structure; extremely
 hard, very firm; nearly continuous clay films or pressure faces on
 faces of peds; few fine black concretions; few fragments of chert
 from 2 mm. to 75 mm. in diameter; neutral; gradual smooth
 boundary.  (9 to 15 inches thick)

      B22t --  36-55 inches, coarsely mottled yellowish red (5YR
 5/6) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, yellowish red (5YR
 4/6) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium
 blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; nearly continuous
 clay films or pressure faces on faces of peds; few fine black
 concretions; about 10 percent by volume of fragments of chert from
 2 mm. to 75 mm. in diameter; moderately alkaline; clear irregular
 boundary.  (0 to 19 inches thick)

      R    --  55-60 inches, hard limestone bedrock; coarsely
 fractured.

  TYPE LOCATION:  Osage County, Oklahoma; about 1.5 miles west and
 2.5 miles north of Foraker; 1800 feet north and 30 feet west of
 the southeast corner of sec. 13, T. 28 N., R. 6 E.

 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to hard
 limestone or chert bedrock range from 40 to 60 inches.

 The A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark gray (N
 4/ ; 10YR 4/1), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  It is silt loam
 or silty clay loam and medium acid or slightly acid.

 The B1 horizon is brown to dark brown (7.5YR 4/2), very dark
 grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark  grayish brown (10YR 4/2).
 Some pedons have a B1 horizon with mottles of red or brown.  It is
 medium acid or slightly acid.

 The B2t horizons are dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2), reddish brown
 (5YR 4/3, 5/3, 4/4, 5/4), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6), or brown
 or dark brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 4/4, 5/4).  Mottles of gray, brown,
 or red occur in most pedons.  Some matrix colors are coarsely
 mottled.  These horizons are silty clay loam or silty clay with
 the clay content of the control section ranging from 35 to 50
 percent.  Fragments of limestone or chert and calcium carbonate
 concretions from 2 mm. to 75 mm. in diameter, make up from 0 to 15
 percent by volume.  Fragments of limestone or chert greater than
 75 mm. in diameter make up from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  The
 B2t horizons range from medium acid to moderately alkaline.

 Some pedons have B3 horizons that have color, texture, and content
 of fragments similar to the B2t horizons.  The B3 horizon ranges
 from neutral to moderately alkaline.

 The R layer is hard limestone and is fractured at intervals from 1
 to 6 feet.

 Competing Series:  These are the Abilene,
 Blanket, Brewer, Corbin, Cutter, Dale, Dodson, Grant, Kingfisher,
 McLain, Pond Creek, St. Paul, Scullin, and Vanoss series.
 Abilene, Blanket, Brewer, Cutter, Dodson, and McLain soils are
 more than 60 inches thick to bedrock.  Corbin, Pond Creek and St.
 Paul soils have sola more than 60 inches thick and lack wetness
 mottles within 1 to 2 feet of the soil surface.  Dale soils lack
 B2t horizons.  Grant, Kingfisher, Scullin, and Vanoss soils have
 mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  In addition, Scullin
 soils have sola 20-40 inches thick over limestone bedrock.

 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wolco soils are on nearly level to very gently  sloping uplands.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  They have
 formed in material weathered from shale and limestone.  The
 climate is dry subhumid or moist subhumid.  Average annual
 precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches; mean annual temperature
 ranges from 57 degrees to 64 degrees F.; Thornthwaite P-E indices
 range from 54 to 64.  A perched water table ranges from 1.5 to 3.0
 from December through April.

 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Corbin series  and the Shidler series.  Shidler soils have less than 35 percent
 clay in the control section, lack argillic horizons, and have hard
 limestone between 4 and 20 inches below the soil surface.

 Drainage and Permeability:  Moderately well drained; slow to
 medium runoff; slow permeability.

 USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for native range and native hay
 meadows.  Some areas are cultivated to small grains, grain
 sorghums, soybeans, and alfalfa.  Tame pastures have been
 established on some old cultivated fields.  Native vegetation is
 mainly mid and tall grass
 prairie.

 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Oklahoma and possibly in
 south central Kansas.  The series is of moderate extent.

 SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Osage County, Oklahoma; 1975.

 REMARKS:  The Wolco soils were formerly included with the Labette
 soils and classified in the Brunizem great soil group.
