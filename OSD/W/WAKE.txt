USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: Mixed hardwood forest of post oak, blackjack oak, northern red oak, and hickory along with shortleaf pine, Virginia pine and loblolly pine. Small areas are used for corn, small grain, orchards, and pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:

Extent: Small 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wake County, North Carolina, 1966.

REMARKS: The April 1994 revision changed the classification from thermic, coated Lithic Quartzipsamments to mixed, thermic Lithic Udipsamments. Laboratory data documents more than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the control section of these soils in North Carolina. North Carolina is the only state that the Wake series has been correlated in. The November 2002 revision moved the type location to another site in Wake County. It also removed the coarse fragment requirement of 15 to 35 percent throughout.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 5 inches (A horizon)
Lithic contact - The occurrence of hard bedrock at 12 inches (R horizon)
