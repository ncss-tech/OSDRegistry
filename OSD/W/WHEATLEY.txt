WHEATLEY SERIES

The Wheatley series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits on lake terraces, outwash plains, lake plains, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Mollic Psammaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Wheatley mucky loamy sand, in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 18 cm (7 inches); black (10YR 2/1) mucky loamy sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inches) thick]

 Cg1--18 to 51 cm (7 to 20 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sand; single grain; loose; about 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [25 to 56 cm (10 to 22 inches) thick]

 Cg2--51 to 152 cm (20 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly sand; single grain; loose; about 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Osceola County, Michigan: 1 1/4 miles west of Park Lake Corner; 1,640 feet west and 600 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 11, T. 20 N., R. 8 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Particle-size control section: 5 to 35 percent rock fragments

O horizon, where present:
Thickness: less than 15 cm (6 inches)
Hue: 5YR, 10YR, or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 0 to 3

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR, or is neutral
Value: 2 to 4
Chroma: 0 to 2
Texture: mucky sand, mucky loamy sand, mucky sandy loam, sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline 

Ap horizon, where present:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: mucky sand, mucky loamy sand, mucky sandy loam, sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline 

Cg horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5GY, or is neutral
Value: 4 to 7
Chroma: 0 to 2; chroma of 2 without mottling is due to uncoated sand grains
Texture: the Cg1 horizon is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, or stratified gravel and coarse sand; the Cg2 horizon is gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand, or stratified gravel and coarse sand.
Rock fragment content: the Cg1 horizon contains 5 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles; the Cg2 horizon contains less than 35 percent gravel at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches) and up to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles at depths greater than 102 cm (40 inches)
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the Cg1 horizon; moderately alkaline in the Cg2 horizon

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cormant, Deinache, Roscommon, and Wabun series. Cormant and Deinache soils contain less than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Roscommon soils are not dominated by gravelly or very gravelly textures below depths of 102 cm (40 inches). Wabun soils have textures that contain more than 15 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wheatley soils are on lake terraces, outwash plains, lake plains, or valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Wheatley soils formed generally in stratified sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.8 degrees C (43 to 46 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 864 mm (29 to 34 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Roscommon soils and the Epoufette soils on similar landscape positions. Epoufette soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in woodland. Major species include northern white cedar, quaking aspen, black spruce, and balsam fir. Only a small acreage is used as cropland for hay and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 90A, 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, 96, and 98 in northern Lower Peninsula and eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northeastern Wisconsin. The series is of moderate extent.
