WHITESAGE SERIES

The Whitesage series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, limestone, shale and quartzite rocks.  Whitesage soils are on fan remnants and structural benches.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Madbeaver (MT), Redrock (T CO) and Rootel (MT) series.

Madbeaver soils are somewhat poorly drained, does not have a Bw horizon and has a lithologic discontinuity.

Redrock soils have greater than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

Rootel soils are moderately deep to hard bedrock.

Madbeaver and Rootel soils have peak periods of precipitation in the spring.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Mean annual temperature: 38 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches

Frost-free period: 85 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abracon, Cortyzack, Diagulch, and Honlu soils.  Abracon and Honlu soils have drier moisture control sections.  In addition, Honlu soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Diagulch and Cortyzack soils have mollic epipedons and are on plateau summits.  In addition, Cortyzack soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential vegetation consists of mountain big sagebrush, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, and bluegrass.  This soil has been correlated to the Upland Loam (Mountain Big Sagebrush) - 047CY310UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern and central Utah.  LRR D and E, MLRA 34B and 47. The series is of small extent.  The name is from a nearby geographic location.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah, 1998.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk2 through Bk5 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk2 through Bk5 horizons).

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.
The fine-loamy particle size classification is a tentative placement.  Further investigation of these landforms and sediments would be necessary to understand the relative percentages of silicate and carbonate sized clays for a definitive placement.

The classification was changed from Haplocalcidic Ustochrepts to frigid Aridic Calciustepts 12/98.
