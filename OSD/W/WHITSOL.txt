TYPE LOCATION: Matanuska-Susitna Valley Area, Alaska; about 1/4 mile east of railroad tracks and 3/4 mile SE of Kashwitna Lake; about 1/2 mile east of the center of section 18, T.20N., R.4W., Seward Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.

Upper C horizons: composed of loamy glacial material that has been reworked by stream action
C horizons below 40 inches: consists of very gravelly coarse sand, stratified sandy and silty material or very gravelly glacial till, less than 18 percent clay

O horizon:

Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture: silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

E and Eb horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 1 or 2

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cohoe, Kenai, Mutnala, and Naptowne series. Cohoe, Kenai, Mutnala, and Naptowne soils lack stratified textures in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess mantle overlying gravelly glaciofluvial deposits
Landform: outwash plains, till plains and hills
Slopes: 0 to 60 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 27 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chunilna and Nancy soils. Chunilna soils are very poorly drained and occur in depressions. Nancy soils are well drained and occur on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very low to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loess mantle and loamy glacial outwash material, and high or very high in the gravelly and sandy material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Forested with paper birch, white spruce, and scattered stands of quaking aspen. A few areas are cleared and used for grass, oats, barley, potatoes, and hardy vegetables.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
