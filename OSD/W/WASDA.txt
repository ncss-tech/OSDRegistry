(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Oap--0 to 6 inches; black (10YR 2/1) muck; about 10 percent fiber; 3 percent rubbed; weak medium granular structure; very friable; few fine pieces of charcoal; many fine roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

     A--14 to 20 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam; massive; slightly sticky; slightly plastic; many fine roots; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

     Bg1--20 to 35 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam with common dark gray (10YR 4/1) pockets of clay; common medium brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) mottles; massive; slightly sticky; slightly plastic; common fine roots; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

     Bg2--35 to 42 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam with thin lenses of gray (10YR 6/1) sand; massive; moderately plastic, moderately sticky; few fine flakes of mica; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (The combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 18 to 32 inches).

     Cg1--42 to 60 inches; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) sandy loam with thin lenses and a few pockets of sand; slightly sticky; slightly plastic; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) friable irregular shaped masses of iron accumulation; few fine flakes of mica; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Cg2--60 to 74 inches; dark greenish gray (5BG 4/1) sand with thin lenses of sandy loam; single grained; loose; slightly acid.

Soil Reaction: Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in A and Bg horizons and very strongly acid to mildly acid in the Cg horizon
Other Features: Mica, feldspar, and other weatherable minerals range from few to common in the B and C horizons

Oa horizons:
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2

Bg horizons:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture--commonly clay loam but ranges to sandy loam, or sandy clay loam: it commonly contains thin lenses of sand and clay
Redoximorphic Features--Few to common masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, yellow, or red are present in some pedons.

Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 or 2; or hue of 5GY or 5BG, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1
