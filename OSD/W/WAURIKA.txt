WAURIKA SERIES

The Waurika series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from old clayey alluvium or in residuum weathered from shale of Permian age, or a combination of these. These nearly level soils occur in slightly concave areas on paleoterraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15.5 degrees c (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in).

REMARKS: 
In 10/2010, the type location was moved to an area more representative of the series.  The previous type location was located in parent material that was weathered from sandstone, and occurred on low hills. Extensively revised as a result of SDJR Initiative, by JLD 02/2016.

Diagnostic horizons and features:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 78 cm (0 to 31 in) (Ap/E, Btss1, Btss2) 
Note: This mollic epipedon has an albic horizon (E/Ap) that separates horizons which together, meet all the requirements of a mollic epipedon
Albic horizon: 11 to 18 cm (4 to 7 in)(E/Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon: 18 to 220 cm (7 to 87 in) 
Abrupt textural change: 18 cm (7 in)(top of the Btss1 horizon)
Slickensides: 18 to 220 cm (7 to 87 in)(Btss, Btkss, and Btssg horizons)
Secondary carbonates: 78 to 143 cm (31 to 56 in)(Btkss1 and Btkss2 horizons)
