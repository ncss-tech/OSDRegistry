WANOMIE SERIES

The Wanomie series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed on relict alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Cambidic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wanomie sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  About 10 percent of the surface is covered with pebbles.

    A--0 to 2 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    C--2 to 7 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 3 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Cq--7 to 13 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; some plates weakly silica-cemented; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 7 inches thick)

    C'--13 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 2 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 7 inches thick)

    C'q--19 to 25 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; strong medium platy structure; hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic, common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 2 percent pebbles; common pan fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4) abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 7 inches thick)

    C''--25 to 30 inches light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 2 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

    2Cqkm--30 to 31 inches; strongly cemented duripan with discontinuous 1 mm laminar cap; massive.  ( 1 to 6 inches thick)

    2C''q--31 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; continuous weak silica cementation; 3 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; approximately 16 miles northwest of the town of Beatty, about 5,000 feet east and 4,000 feet south of the approximate northwest corner of section 26, T. 9 N., R. 45 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTIC:

Soil moisture - Usually dry, but moist in some horizon for short periods during winter and spring month, and for short intermittent periods following summer convection storms.

Soil temperature - 65 to 67 degrees F.

Depth to duripan - 20 to 40 inches.

Reaction - Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Cementation - All profiles contain some pan fragments in a horizon above the duripan.  Some profiles contain cemented masses or a few durinodes.


Control section - Clay content:  5 to 18 percent, by average.

Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent.


A horizon - Value:  6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist.

Chroma:  3 or 4 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Structure:  Platy or subangular blocky.


C and Cq horizons - Value:  6 through 8 dry, 5 through 8 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4 dry, 3 through 6 moist.

Texture:  Stratified loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.

Clay content:  5 to 18 percent.

Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent.

Structure:  Subangular blocky, platy or massive.

Effervescence:  Slightly effervescent or violently effervescent.


Cqkm horizon  - Chroma:  1 through 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.

Other features:  Discontinuous thin laminar cap 1 to 4 mm thick which grades to strongly cemented then weakly cemented layers below.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Shamock soils are similar but have an indurated duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wanomie soils are on relict alluvial flats and fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 2,600 to 5,200 feet.  The winters are cool and the summers are hot and dry.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 58 to 62 degrees F.; the frost-free season is about 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Canutio and Seaman soils. The Canutio soils has a loamy-skeletal control section and the Seaman soils have no pan to a depth of 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Very slow or slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly ephedra, littleleaf horsebrush, and shadscale.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nye County, Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 30.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES PROPOSED:  Nye County, Nevada.  (Southwest part)  1983.  The name is coined from a former mining town on the Nellis Bombing Range.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Entic feature - The strongly cemented zone from 30 to 31 inches.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 30 inches.
