WOCKLEY SERIES

The Wockley series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slow permeable soils.  These nearly level soils formed in loamy sediments from the Willis Formation of late Pliocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent but is dominantly from 0.1 to 0.5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Loamy sediments derived from the Willis Formation of late Pliocene age
Landscape: Coastal Plain Landform: Flat
Slope: 0 to 3 percent but is dominantly from 0.1 to 0.5 percent
Mean annual temperature: 19.5 to 21.1 degrees C (67 to 70 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1041 to 1245 mm (41 to 49 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the spring and fall.  Summertime rainfall is controlled by the influx of tropical moisture.
Frost-free period: 240 to 300 days
Elevation: 61 to 91 m (200 to 300 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 52 to 72

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gessner, Hockley, and Snakecreekseries.  
Gessner series: poorly drained and in depressions
Hockley series: well drained and on a higher landscape position
Snakecreek series: poorly drained and on a lower landscape position 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Moderately slow permeability.  Runoff is high on slope up to 1 percent and very high on 1 to 3 percent slope.  The soil is saturated from a depth of 10 to 84 cm (4 to 33 in) for periods of 3 to 6 weeks during the winter and spring months and after heavy rainfall events in the summer and fall months.  In normal years, these soils will reduce for periods of 1 or 2 weeks during the wettest period.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as cropland and pastureland.  Urban encroachment is in the eastern portion of this series' extent.  The  dominant pasture grass is improved bermudagrass or bahiagrass.  The dominant crop is corn.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas; LRR T; MLRA 150A; Large extent.

Additional Comments: This series was established during the initial survey of Harris County to reflect those soils included in the Hockley series but phased on drainage class.  The series was revised in January 2001 as part of the MLRA 150A update.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S88TX-201-001 from Harris County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory at Lincoln, Nebraska on sample (S88TX-201-001) from a representative pedon in Harris County, Texas.
