MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pasquotank County, North Carolina; 1951. 

REMARKS: The 08/2008 revision moves the type location from Pasquotank County, North Carolina to Hyde County, North Carolina.  The pedon in Hyde County is more representative of the series concept.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Aquic moisture regime
Umbric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 inches
Cambic horizon--the zone from depths of 13 to 45 inches
Contrasting layers are at depths of 45 to 72 inches.
