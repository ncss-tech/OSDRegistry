WENDOVER SERIES

The Wendover series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on mountainsides and hill slopes. They formed in colluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Slope ranges from 10 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches.  The frost free season is 115 to 130 days.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wendover very gravelly fine sandy loam - on a convex 17 percent slope utilized as rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

     A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

     Bt--4 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel; 25 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slight effervescence;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary (5 to 12 inches thick)

     Bk--10 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 30 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; violent effervescence; calcium carbonate disseminated,  as soft segregated masses, and as coatings under rock fragments;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).  (6 to 10 inches thick)

     R--18 to 20 inches; hard limestone, somewhat fractured.

TYPE LOCATION:  Goshen County, Wyoming; 2,310 feet east and 265 feet south of the NW corner of Sec. 11, T. 30 N., R. 65 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 54 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 65 degrees to 72 degrees F.  Depth to a lithic contact is 7 to 20 inches. Percent rock fragments consisting of gravel, cobbles and stones ranges from 35 to 80 percent throughout.

The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The matrix is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The matrix is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam averaging 18 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

The Bk horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Montvale, Motoqua, Phizphre (T), Santa Fe and Slidymtn soils.  Montvale, Motoqua and Santa Fe soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Phizphre soils do not have a Bk horizon.  Slidymtn soils are non-calcareous throughout and formed in volcanic parent material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wendover soils are on moderately steep to very steep mountainsides and hill slopes.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium derived from limestone.  Elevation is 4,900 to 6,100 feet.  Annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brownrigg, Lambman, Featherlegs, Willowman and Wolf soils, and the competing Motoqua soils.  Brownrigg and Lambman soils have a paralithic contact.  Featherlegs, Willowman and Wolf soils are very deep.. Motoqua soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is bluestem, blue grama, western wheatgrass, side-oats grama, needleandthread grass, threadleaf sedge, mountain mahogany, and widely spaced juniper and ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.
