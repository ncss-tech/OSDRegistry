WOODFORD SERIES

The Woodford series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy material weathered from sandstone of Mississippian age.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on ridges and side slopes of uplands in the Arbuckle Mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, thermic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Woodford silt loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 7 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) flaggy silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium granular structure; hard, very friable; many fine roots; 15 percent by volume of fragments of sandstone more than 3 inches. in diameter and 5 percent by volume of fragments of sandstone less than 3 inches. in diameter; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 11 inches thick)

     A2--7 to 17 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) extremely flaggy silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong medium granular structure; hard, very friable; many fine roots; 40 percent by volume of fragments of sandstone more than 3 inches in diameter and 25 percent by volume of fragments of sandstone less than 3 inches in diameter; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick)

     R--17 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fractured sandstone; hard; tilted 30 degrees from horizontal.

TYPE LOCATION:  Carter County, Oklahoma; about 4 miles east and 1 mile north or Woodford; 700 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 29, T.  2 S., R. 1 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to sandstone bedrock range from 5 to 20 inches.

The A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is flaggy or very flaggy silt loam or loam, and channery or very channery silt loam, or loam with a clay content ranging from 12 to 25 percent.  Fragments of sandstone more than 3 inches in diameter range from 15 to 45 percent by volume and fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent by volume.  Total volume of coarse fragments ranges from 15 to 50 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.

The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is extremely flaggy or extremely channery silt loam or loam.  Fragments of sandstone more than 3 inches in diameter range from 20 to 40 percent by volume, and fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 25 to 40 percent by volume.  Total volume of coarse fragments ranges from 60 to 80 percent.
The R layer has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The sandstone bedrock is tilted from 20 to 70 degrees from horizontal.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Aledo, Brewster, Catto, Eckert, Eckrant, Ector, Kiti, Lampshire, Lueders, Mabray, Oplin, Palopinto, Rayford, Renish, Shidler, St. Thomas, Timhill, and Volco series.  Aledo, Ector, Lueders, Mabray, Oplin, and St. Thomas soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  In addition, Mabray and St. Thomas soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Brewster, Catto, Eckert, Kiti, Lampshire, Palopinto, Rayford, Renish, Shidler, and Timhill soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Brewster, Eckert, and Lampshire soils are dry for longer periods of time; Kiti soils are underlain with limestone; and Renish and Shidler soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Eckrant soils have clayey-skeletal control sections.  Volco soils have calcic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These gently sloping to moderately steep Woodford soils are on south facing convex ridges and sideslopes of uplands in the Arbuckle Mountains.  Slopes are convex and range from 3 to 20 percent.  These soils have formed in material weathered from steeply dipping sandstone bedrock of Mississippian age.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 40 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 50 to 64.  Frost free days range from 210 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 1500 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Kiti series and the Heiden series.  Heiden soils occur in lower positions and are more than 20 inches thick and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Kiti soils are on similar landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is very high; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland.  Vegetation consists of mid native grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Oklahoma.  The series is of minor extent.
