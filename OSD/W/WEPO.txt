WEPO SERIES

The Wepo series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from shale and sandstone. Wepo soils are on stream terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches (203 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Vertic Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Wepo clay loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(6 to 15 inches thick) 

 Bk2--26 to 32 inches (66 to 81 cm); pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay with few thin strata of sandy loam and silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; few fine lime accumulations in root channels and pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 11 inches thick or 10 to 28 cm)

TYPE LOCATION: Navajo County, Arizona, about 1.5 miles west of Elbow Point; about 1,200 feet east and 1,600 feet north of the southwest corner of section 8, T. 25 N., R. 16 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the SMCS during July-August and December-February. Driest during May and June. Typic aridic soil moisture regime. 

Soil Temperature: 52 to 56 degrees F (11 to 13 degrees C). 

Carbonates: Slightly to strongly effervescent throughout; secondary lime as masses and fillings in the lower part. Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15 percent. 
Cole: more than 0.05 in the A and B horizons 

A horizon
Hue: 10YR, 7.5 YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wepo soils are on stream terraces. Flooding is very rare and very brief. Elevations range from 5,100 to 6,200 feet (1,555 to1890 meters) . Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in stream alluvium derived dominantly from shale and sandstone. The average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 mm). The average annual temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F (11 to 12 degrees C). The average frost free period is 130 to 160 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jocity, Polacca (P) and Tewa (P) soils. Jocity soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains and are stratified throughout. Polacca and Tewa soils are on stream terraces. Polacca soils have contrasting particle size and Tewa soils are fine-loamy. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for livestock grazing. Vegetation includes alkali sacaton, galleta, bottlebrush squirreltail, blue grama and fourwing saltbush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Arizona. The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 35; LRR-D.
