WAIKANE SERIES

The Waikane series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered in alluvium and colluvium from basic igneous rock.  Waikane soils are on fans and terraces and have slopes of 3 to 70 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, isotic, isohyperthermic Typic Haplohumults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Waikane silty clay - pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  All textures are "apparent field textures.")

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silty clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) dry; strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; many worm holes and casts; very slight effervescence with hydrogen peroxide; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw1--8 to 19 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silty clay, dark reddish brown (7.5YR 3/4) dry; strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common patchy coatings on peds; few hard earthy lumps; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt1--19 to 31 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silty clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) dry; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, fine, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common dark red (2.5YR 3/6) thin continuous clay films on peds and within pores; few highly weathered pebbles; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--31 to 60 inches; same color, texture, structure and consistence as above; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; thin continuous dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay films on peds and in pores; common highly weathered pebbles; very strongly acid (pH 4.7).

TYPE LOCATION:  Island of Oahu, Honolulu County, Hawaii; Kahana Quadrangle - 21 degrees 32 minutes 04 seconds north latitude and 157 degrees 51 minutes 30 seconds west longitude; Kaaawa Valley; 1-1/2 miles south and west on Kamehameha Highway from the town of Kaaawa to the pasture entrance of the Kualoa Ranch; turn west on pasture road and proceed 1 miles; on a terrace 0.2 mile north of pasture road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The content of highly weathered gravel in the solum increases with increasing depth and ranges from 5 percent in the upper part to 40 percent in the lower part.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 72 degrees F.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 through 4.

The B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 3 or 4.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kaneohe and Lolekaa series.  Kaneohe soils have a smeary 2.5YR or redder argillic horizon.  Lolekaa soils have 10YR hue throughout the solum and thick continuous clay films in the upper part of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Waikane soils are on alluvial fans and terraces at elevations from 200 to 1,000 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from basic igneous material.  Annual rainfall is 50 to 70 inches.  Average January temperature is about 70 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 75 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Kaneohe and Lolekaa soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff depending on slope; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture, truck crops, and urban development.  Vegetation is guava (Psidium guajava), christmasberry (Schinus terebinthifolius), joee (Stachytarpheta jamaicensis) creeping Chinese violet (Centella asiatica), hilograss (Paspalum conjugatum), and ricegrass (Paspalum orbiculare).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Island of Oahu, Hawaii.  The series is moderately extensive with an area of about 11,700 acres.
