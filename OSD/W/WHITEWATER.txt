WHITEWATER SERIES

The Whitewater series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in sodium-enriched residuum or alluvium over residuum derived from claystone.  Whitewater soils are on pediment slopes.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 395 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, mesic Sodic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Whitewater silty clay, on a south-facing slope of 1 percent in native grass.  When described the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 8 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak fine blocky structure parting to weak very fine and fine granular; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; trans-horizon cracks 0.5 to 2 cm wide; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bss--8 to 41 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) clay; gray (10YR 5/1) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; trans-horizon cracks 0.5 to 2 cm wide; few intersecting slickensides; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (17 to 46 cm thick)

    BCkss--41 to 66 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) clay; gray (10YR 5/1) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; trans-horizon cracks 0.5 to 2 cm wide; few intersecting slickensides; few fine soft masses of carbonate; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

    Ck--66 to 84 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; trans-horizon cracks 0.5 to 2 cm wide; few intersecting slickensides; few fine soft masses of carbonate; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary.

    Cr--84 to 200 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) soft claystone; pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) moist; soft when moist but hard and brittle when dry; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline.

Texture (in lieu):  Sodic claystone of the Chadron formation of the White River group

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in this taxonomic class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform:  pediments, fans, and terraces
Landscape:  badlands and plains
Parent material:  sodic residuum or alluvium over residuum derived from claystone
Slopes:  0 to 15 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 6 to 10 degrees C; soil moisture regime is aridic-ustic
Mean annual precipitation: 355 to 455 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedarpass, Denby, and Orella soils.
Cedarpass and Denby soils are very deep; additionally the Cedarpass soils are fine-silty.  They occur on similar or slighly lower landscape positions then Whitewater soils
Orella soils are shallow.  They occur on higher landscape positions then Whitewater soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to very high depending on slope.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used primarily as rangeland.  The native vegetation dominantly is a thin stand of western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, blue grama, and pricklypear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern South Dakota and possibly northern Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.
