WITKNEE SERIES

The Witknee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on alluvial terraces of mountain valleys.  Witknee soils formed in floodplain sediments from mixed lithology, dominated by volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Witknee very fine sandy loam, wet meadow, on 2 percent slope at elevation of 4,320 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A1--0 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine, very fine and medium roots; many fine and very fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. 

  A2--5 to 13 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of A horizons combined is 10 to 20 inches.)

  Bw--13 to 25 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; common medium distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/3) redox concentrations; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderate plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 19 inches thick) 

  Bg--25 to 33 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; many medium distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/3) redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 32 inches thick)

  2C--33 to 61 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; massive; slightly hard, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
