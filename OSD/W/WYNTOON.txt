COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wyntoon soils are on hills and fan remnants.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 3,200 to 4,300 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches including annual snowfall of 60 to 84 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Neer, Nikal, Ponto, and Shasta soils.  Neer soils are medial-skeletal, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and occur near lava flow ridges.  Nikal soils are medial, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and occur are on the edges of lava flow ridges.  Ponto soils are medial and do not have argillic horizons.  Shasta soils are ashy, do not have argillic horizons, are occur on outwash plains and alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wyntoon soils are used for timber production and homesite development.  The vegetation is a forest canopy of Jeffrey pine, ponderosa pine, white fir, and incense-cedar with an understory of squawcarpet, Saskatoon serviceberry, deerbrush, tanoak, and whitethorn ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 21 and 22B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Siskiyou County (Intermountain Area Soil Survey), California, 1994.

REMARKS:  This revision updates the MLRAs.  A revision in March 2004 corrected the type location section.  A revision in August 2000 updated the mineralogy class from mixed to isotic and added the medial compositional textural modifier to the two A horizons having andic soil properties.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).

Andic soil properties - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).

Argillic horizon - The zone from 9 to more than 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6, and 2Bt7 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and part of the 2Bt3 horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S81CA-093-004 (pedon # 81P0714).  It was also analyzed by the soils laboratory at UC Davis as # 81-47-153, #1513.
