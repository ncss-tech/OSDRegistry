SERIES ESTABLISHED: Queen Anne's County, Maryland, 1995.

REMARKS: Whitemarsh soils were previously mapped as the Elkton series. It is distinguished from Elkton by having an abrupt textural change between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) (Oi, Oe, A, Eg1 and Eg2 horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) (Eg1 and Eg2 horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 30 to 140 centimeters (12 to 55 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)
Aquic conditions-- the zone from 0 to 183 centimeters (0 to 72 inches) 
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 152 centimeters (0 to 60 inches)

The following changes have been made (12/2012):
