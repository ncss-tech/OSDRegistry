WINNER SERIES

The Winner series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Winner soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Winner clay loam in irrigated hay and pasture on a 1 percent slope.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Azg--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), moist, iron masses; moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine filaments and soft masses of salts; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    ACzg--4 to 14 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; common fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/6), moist, iron masses; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine soft masses and filaments of salt; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    ACz--14 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist iron masses; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine soft masses of salts; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual wavy boundary. 

    AC--23 to 31 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish red (5YR 5/6), moist, iron masses; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary. 

    2C--31 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), moist, iron masses; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 15 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 30 percent stones; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bishop, Millington, and Stearns series. Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Havelock and Tremont series.  Bishop soils have value of 5 moist and 6 dry in the C horizon below depths of 28 inches and occur in a climatic zone with 220 day growing season and 5 to 6 inches of precipitation. Havelock and Millington soils have moisture control sections that are dry less than 45 days in the 4 months following the summer solstice. Stearns soils are poorly drained and have SAR greater than 13. Tremont soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Parent material: alluvium derived from mixed sources

Landform: flood plains

Slopes: 0 to 2 percent

Elevation: 6,200 to 7,100 feet

Mean annual temperature: 46 to 52 degrees F

Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches

Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Umbarg and Tesajo soils.  Tesajo soils are moderately well drained and are skeletal.  Umbarg soils are moderately well drained and have a watertable at 36 inches or below.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, negligible to medium runoff, moderately slow permeability.  These soils are rarely flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as irrigated hay and pasture.  Vegetation is mainly smooth brome, orchard grass, timothy, bluegrass and sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA, 36.  This series is of small extent.
