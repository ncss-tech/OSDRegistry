WAMP SERIES

The Wamp series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Wamp soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slope ranges from 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Goodwater, Purob, and Spager series. Goodwater soils have a very weak to moderately cemented hardpan. Purob soils have a typic- aridic soil moisture regime. Spager soils have an aridic bordering on xeric moisture regime, a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C., and 15 to 20 percent clay content. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wamp soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slope ranges from 4 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Elevations are 1460 to 2150 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Doespring and Quijinump soils. Doespring soils are on higher elevation fan remnants. Quijinump soils are on inset fans and fan aprons at lower elevations and do not have hardpans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the petrocalcic horizon and very low in the lower part of the petrocalcic. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, mountain big sagebrush and blue grama. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
