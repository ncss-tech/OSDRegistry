WATHENA SERIES

The Wathena series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium. Wathena soils are on nearly level to rolling natural levees on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Mollic Udifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Wathena loamy fine sand, on a 1 percent slope, in a soybean field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 Ap-- 0 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2), crushed, loamy fine sand; 4.0 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; common very fine and fine roots; slightly effervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 11 inches thick) 

 C1--9 to 37 inches; dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3), crushed, stratified loamy fine sand; 3.0 percent clay; massive; few fine roots; slightly effervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (12 to 32 inches thick) 

 2C2--37 to 52 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), crushed, stratified silt loam; 12.0 percent clay; few thin 1/2" strata of 10YR 4/1 (moist) silt loam; massive; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist iron accumulations; strongly effervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. 

 2C3--52 to 64 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), crushed, stratified silt loam and fine sand and silty clay loam; 1 to 5 inch strata of each texture throughout horizon; massive; 12.0 percent clay; 38.0 percent clay; 2.0 percent clay; few medium platelike black (N 2/0) soft masses of iron-manganese in cracks; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist iron accumulations and few fine distinct gray (10YR 6/1) moist iron depletions; strongly effervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the 2C horizon is 12 to 35 inches.) 

 3C4--64 to 80 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), crushed, fine sand; single grain; slightly effervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Morconick soils are in areas that have a mean annual air temperature range of 45 to 50 degrees F and mean annual precipitation range of 24 to 30 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--sandy alluvium
Landform--natural levees on flood plains
Slope--0 to 4 percent
Elevation--800 to 1,200 feet
Mean annual air temperature--53 to 55 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation--35 to 42 inches
Frost-free period--180 to 185 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Albaton soils are clayey and are in slight depressions on flood plains
Haynie soils are coarse silty and are on less undulating positions on the flood plain
Onawa soils are more clayey throughout and are on flats on flood plains
Sarpy soils lack strata of material finer than loamy fine sand in the 10 to 40 inch control section 
Waldron soils are more clayey throughout and are on flats on flood plains 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained
Runoff--low 
Permeability--rapid or moderately rapid 
Flooding--occasional unless protected by levees for brief periods during the months of November through June. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Native vegetation commonly is a thin stand of native grasses and sandburrs or cottonwood and willow trees. Cultivated areas are in pasture or are used to grow alfalfa, corn, oats, soybeans, or wheat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR M, MLRA 107; mainly along the Missouri River in Kansas; small extent.
