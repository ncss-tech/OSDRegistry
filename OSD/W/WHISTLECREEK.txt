WHISTLECREEK SERIES

The Whistlecreek series consist of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes are from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Whistlecreek clay loam, 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,442 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 11 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 3 percent fine 7.5YR 6/6 iron oxidized masses; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

   C1--11 to 23 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry; massive; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout, few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent fine 7.5YR 6/6 oxidized iron masses and 2 percent fine 2.5Y 7/2 iron depletions; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

   C2--23 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots throughout; 10 percent fine 7.5YR 6/6 oxidized iron masses and 5 percent fine 2.5Y 6/2 iron depletions; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick)

   Cg1--30 to 39 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; massive; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout; 5 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses and 15 percent fine 2.5Y 6/1 iron depletions; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

   Cg2--39 to 200 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very gravelly sandy loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 2 percent fine 7.5YR 5/6 oxidized iron masses and 25 percent fine 2.5Y 6/1 iron depletions; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.
