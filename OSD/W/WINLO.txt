WINLO SERIES

The Winlo series consist of shallow to pan somewhat poorly
drained soils that formed in alluvium.  They are on fan terraces
and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  They are the intermound soil
on a pattern ground landscape.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53
degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic, shallow Typic Duraquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Winlo gravelly clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors
are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

A--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very
gravelly clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; many fine
distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; strong fine and very
fine granular structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many
fine and very fine roots; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent
cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

Bw--4 to 9 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very gravelly clay,
brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine
roots; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid
(pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

2Bqm--9 to 17 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) indurated
duripan, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry; massive; medium and fine
nearly continuous silica laminae; common fine black stains; 40 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; clear smooth boundary.  (4
to 12 inches thick)

2C1--17 to 24 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) extremely
gravelly coarse sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) and yellow (10YR 7/6) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky
and nonplastic; discontinuous weakly cemented silien laminae; 55 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 40 inches thick)

2C2--42 to 60 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) extremely
gravelly coarse sandy loam, pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) dry; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Oregon; 500 feet west and 200
feet south of intersection of Table Rock Road and Kirtland Road, about 1,150 feet east and 440 feet north of the southwest corner
of sec. 13, T. 36 S., R. 2 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are saturated with water
during the winter season.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54
to 56 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan is 7 to 15 inches.  Depth
to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The textural control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 30 to 45
percent are gravel and 5 to 15 percent are cobbles.  It has 40 to
50 percent clay.  Prominent or distinct mottles are in the A and
Bw horizons.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and
4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 moist and 4
or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The duripan is indurated throughout or indurated in some part.

The 2C has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and 6
or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand with 50 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 30
percent cobbles.  Thin layers of loam and silt loam may occur in
this horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winlo soils are shallow to a pan and
somewhat poorly drained.  They are on fan terraces and have
slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  They are the intermound soil on a
pattern ground landscape.  Elevation is 1,100 to 1,850 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150
to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Agate and Provig soils.  Agate soils are 20 to 40 inches to a duripan.  Provig
soils are well drained and lack a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; ponded, very slow runoff; very slow permeability.  A water table is at 6
inches above the surface to 6 inches below the surface from
December to April.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for grazing and building sites.  Native vegetation consists of grasses and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Rogue and Bear Creek Valleys in Jackson County, Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
