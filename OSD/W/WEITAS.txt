WEITAS SERIES 

The Weitas series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loamy colluvium from granitic or metamorphic rocks.  The Weitas soils are in concave positions, drainageways and slumps on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high in the lower part. The average annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over loamy, glassy over isotic Vitric Fulvicryands

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weitas soils are in concave positions, drainageways and slumps on mountain slopes.  These soils formed volcanic ash and loamy colluvium from granitic or metamorphic rocks.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,800 feet (1067 to 1768 meters).  The climate has cool, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches (1016 to 1524 mm).  The average annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 30 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aldermand, Judgetown, and Jury series.  Aldermand soils are on mountain slopes and have a vitrandic surface. Judgetown soils are on convex mountain slopes and are deep to weathered granite. Jury soils are on concave mountain slopes and do not have a umbric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and high in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Weitas soils are used for watershed and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation is sitka alder, rocky mountain maple, sedges, huckleberry, queencup beadlily, wild ginger, bunchberry dogwood, goldthread, common princes pine, starry false-Solomons seal, and american trailplant. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho; the series is not extensive.  MLRA 43A.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: 

Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 22 inches (A1, A2, Bw1 horizons) 

Cambic horizon - the zone from 14 to 37 inches (Bw1 and 2Bw horizons).

Particle size control section - the zone from 0 to 40 inches (A1, A2 horizon, Bw1, 2Bw2 and part of the 2C horizon) 

The range in values listed under the Range in Characteristics for Volcanic glass content, acid-oxalate extractable Al, Phosphorous retention, 15-bar water retention and Bulk desity are estimates only.

Type location moved to present location in 1994. The Weitas series was formerly classified as Coarse-loamy, mixed Typic Cryumbrepts.
