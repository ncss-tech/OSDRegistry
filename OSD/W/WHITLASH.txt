WHITLASH SERIES

The Whitlash series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from fine grained igneous rocks and noncalcareous sandstone and siltstone. These soils are on eroded fan remnants, mountain slopes, hillslopes, escarpments, structural benches, ridges, lahars and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Whitlash gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--10 to 23 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium and fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A1 & A2 horizons - 18 to 25 cm)

    Bw--23 to 40 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 35 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    R--40 cm; igneous bedrock.
