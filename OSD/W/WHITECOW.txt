WHITECOW SERIES 

The Whitecow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone.  These soils are on mountains, hills, alluvial fan remnants, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Typic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Whitecow gravelly loam, woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed forest litter of needles and twigs. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A--1 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots, few medium roots; 25 percent subrounded gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk1--4 to 11 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; 40 percent angular gravel; 5 percent angular cobbles; continuous faint lime crusts on undersides of rock fragments; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bk2--11 to 21 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few or common fine roots; common fine pores; 50 percent angular gravel, 5 percent angular cobbles; continuous distinct lime coats on rock fragments; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bk3--21 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) extremely gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 70 percent angular gravel, 5 percent angular cobbles; continuous distinct lime coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick) 

    Bk4--31 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) extremely gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 70 percent angular gravel, 5 percent angular cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.
