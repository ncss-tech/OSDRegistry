WILSPRING SERIES 

The Wilspring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from hard brown shale or argillite. These soils are on escarpments, ridges, sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wilspring channery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent flagstone, 20 percent channers; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bw--3 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common to many fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent flagstone, 20 percent channers; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bk1--7 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; common to many fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent flagstones, 35 percent channers; disseminated lime, common distinct lime coatings on underside of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--12 to 24 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very channery loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common to many very fine roots; few to common fine and very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent flagstones, 45 percent channers; disseminated lime, few fine masses of lime, continuous distinct lime crusts on surfaces of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 13 to 20 inches.) 

    R--24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) hard fractured shale.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1590. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric horizon from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 3 to 12 inches (Bw, Bk1 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 24 inches (Bk horizons); a layer of secondary carbonate accumulation from 12 to 24 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); hard, fractured shale bedrock at 24 inches (R horizon).  Wilspring soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
