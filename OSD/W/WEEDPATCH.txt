WEEDPATCH SERIES

The Weedpatch series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock.  Weedpatch soils are on relict basin floors.  Slope is 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bridge, Deltajo, Laverkin, Sotim, Sunrise, and Turney series.  Bridge, Deltajo, Sotim, and Turney soils have moisture control sections moist 40 to 60 days during the summer months. Laverkin soils have soil temperatures below 47 degrees F. in January and February.  Sunrise soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weedpatch soils are on relict basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock.  Elevations are 280 to 375 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 6 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bakersfield (T), Cajon, Kimberlina, Milagro (T), Panoche, and Wasco soils.  Bakersfield and Milagro soils are on adjacent flood plains and have an irregular decrease in organic matter.  Cajon soils are on adjacent alluvial fans and flood plains and are sandy.  Kimberlina and Wasco soils are on adjacent low alluvial fans and are coarse-loamy.  Panoche soils are on adjacent low alluvial fans and do not have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow to slow runoff; slow permeability.  These soils are subject to rare flooding but are protected by dams and/or levees.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Weedpatch soils are used for irrigated crops and homesite development.  The native vegetation is annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern San Joaquin Valley of California.  The series is not extensive in MLRA 17.
