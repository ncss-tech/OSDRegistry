WEIGLE SERIES

The Weigle series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale and limestone.  Weigle soils are on hill crests and side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Xeric Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Weigle gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw--10 to 18 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium fine, and very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; strongly  effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bqkm--18 to 25 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan with fractures at 15 to 25 cm intervals; light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm; violently effervescent; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 13 cm thick)

    Bqk--25 to 46 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel and cobbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 28 cm thick)

    R--46 cm; fractured shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about 48 miles south of Carlin at the southern end of Pine Valley; about 2,000 feet north and 500 feet west of the southeast corner of section 5, T.25 N., R. 50 E.; USGS Pete Hanson Creek 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 04 minutes 31 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 20 minutes 56 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.0752778 latitude, -116.3488889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 15 to 36 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 38 to 50 cm.
Indurated duripan: Commonly fractured at 15 to 30 cm intervals, continuous in some pedons.
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  10 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Bw horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Loam or gravelly loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Nouque, Raz and Umil soils. 

Nouque and Umil soils lack a lithic contact below the duripan. Raz soils average 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weigle soils are on hill crests and side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum derived from shale and limestone.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,740 to 2,045 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ados, Dotard, Hopeka and Maghills soils.  All of these soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and lack a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, horsebrush, low rabbitbrush, Sandberg bluegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are
not extensive. MLRA 28B.
