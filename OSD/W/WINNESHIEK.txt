WINNESHIEK SERIES

The Winneshiek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments with or without a thin paleosol over limestone bedrock. These soils are convex side slopes on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs
