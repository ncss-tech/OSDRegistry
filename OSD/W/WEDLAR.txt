WEDLAR SERIES

The Wedlar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks or welded tuff.  Wedlar soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and inter-plateau basins.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aladshi, Alley, Allor, Chime, Cleghorn, Glyphs, Igert, Nevador, Qwynn, Wedertz, and Zevadez series.

All of these soils except Qwynn are drier during summer months.  In addition:  Aladshi and Allor soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Alley  and Qwynn soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Chime soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Cleghorn soils have horizons which are firm and brittle when moist.  Igert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Nevador soils do not have albic horizons, have argillic horizons with bases at 30 to 60 cm, and do not have gravelly horizons below the argillic horizon.  Wedertz and Zevadez soils have horizons which are firm and brittle when moist.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wedlar soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and inter-plateau basins.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks or welded rhyolitic tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,524 to 2,195 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rowel, Ravenell, and Wellsed soils.  Rowel soils are loamy-skeletal and shallow to lithic contacts.  Ravenell soils are loamy-skeletal and very shallow and shallow to paralithic contacts.  Wellsed soils are moderately deep to indurated duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately high or moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wedlar soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  Wedlar soils are not extensive with about 8,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.
