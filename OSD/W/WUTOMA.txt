WUTOMA SERIES 

The Wutoma series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from pyroclastics and cinders.  Wutoma soils are on cinder cones and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal over fragmental or cindery, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wutoma extremely gravelly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 75 percent cinders; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--2 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 70 percent cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 14 inches thick) 

    2C--12 to 60 inches; black cinders; few medium roots; few pockets and stratifications of extremely cindery loam.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; about 6 miles south of Mt. Trumbull; 600 feet south and 2,000 feet west of the northeast corner of Section 20, T. 34 N., R. 8 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-March.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime. 

Soil temperature - 47 to 56 degrees F.

Rock Fragments - 60 to 80 percent cinders in the control section 

Cinder lag on the surface - Up to 2 inches thick 

Depth to cinders - 11 to 20 inches 

Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Effervescence - Ranges from noneffervescent to violently effervescent 

A horizon 
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR 
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry, 1 through 4 moist 

Bw horizon 
Hue:  10YR, 7.5YR 
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma: 1 through 4, dry or moist 

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lozinta (AZ) series.  Lozinta soils have cinders at depths of 20 to 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wutoma soils are at elevations of 5,800 to 7,500 feet on strongly sloping to steep cinder cones.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from pyroclastics and cinders.  The climate is warm and semi-arid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lozinta and the Moab series.  Moab soils are loamy and have a calcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is galleta, Mormon tea, blue grama, Indian ricegrass and big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  This soil is of minor extent. MLRA 35.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon) 

Cambic horizon - The zone from 2 to 12 inches (Bw horizon) 

Cinder deposit at a depth of 12 inches 

Vitrandic subgroup - no available data in support of the subgroup other than known coarse fragment composition and correlator experience with Andisols.
