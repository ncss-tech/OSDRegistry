WINGATE SERIES 

The Wingate series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains. They formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying calcareous loamy till. They are moderately permeable in the solum and moderately slowly permeable in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wingate soils are on Wisconsin-aged till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess or other silty material and the underlying calcareous loamy till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 55 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 40 inches, frost-free period ranges from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 600 to 1,020 feet above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Wingate soils are on Wisconsin-aged till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and the underlying calcareous loamy till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.8 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1092 mm (32 to 43 inches, frost-free period ranges from 145 to 195 days, and elevation ranges from 186 to 293 meters (610 to 960 feet) above sea level. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. An intermittent perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cropped to corn, soybeans, or small grain. A few small areas are used for hayland or pasture. Native vegetation is mixed prairie grasses and hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Illinois and west-central Indiana. The Wingate series is of moderate extent in MLRA 95B, 108 and 111.
