WHITEPOST SERIES

The Whitepost series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy sediments overlying silty lacustrine sediments on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Darfur, Dassel, Gilford, Goodell, Hanska, Jubilee, Lyles, Monon, Mudgepond, Overshue, Toolesboro, and Uniongrove series. Darfur and Overshue soils are in climates that have mean annual temperature of less than 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F), and receive less than 762 mm (30 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Dassel, Gilford, Goodell, Hanska, Lyles, Mudgepond, Toolesboro, and Uniongrove soils have less than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Jubilee soils have a high mica content, are at elevations above 466 meters (1,530 feet), and receive less than 762 mm (30 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Monon soils do not have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whitepost soils are on nearly level or depressional areas on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges range from 0 to 1 percent. Whitepost soils formed in loamy and sandy sediments overlying silty lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brady, Bronson, Gilford, Headlee, Medaryville, Mermill, Radioville, Rensselaer, and Whiskerville soils. The somewhat poorly drained Brady, Headlee, and Medaryville soils and the moderately well drained Bronson and Whiskerville soils are on swells on outwash plains and lake plains. Gilford and Rensselaer soils are on similar landforms but lack silty lacustrine sediments. Radioville soils are on similar landforms but have more clay in the subsoil.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and moderately low or low in the lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and slow or very slow in the lacustrine sediments.

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly cropped. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, wheat, and oats. Native vegetation is marsh grasses, reeds, sedges, pin oak, and red maple forests.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches) (Ap, A horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 102 cm (12 to 40 inches) (Bg horizons).
Aquic conditions: chroma of 2 below the mollic epipedon and in all underlying horizons.

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 155050 represents the typical pedon in complex with Gilford soils.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S98IN-131-002) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, NE. Transect data for the typical pedon (T97IN-131-182) is on file in MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect in a Whitepost-Gilford complex map unit shows 50 percent Whitepost, 40 percent Gilford, and 10 percent Granby, lacustrine substratum, soils.
