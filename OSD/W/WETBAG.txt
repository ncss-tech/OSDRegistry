WETBAG SERIES

The Wetbag series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Wetbag soils are on fan remnants and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm inches and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Egeria, Railway, and Silvies series.

Egeria soils do not have argillic horizons, do not have horizons with slickensides, and have mean annual soil temperature of 2.2 to 4.4 degrees C.  Railway soils do not have argillic horizons, have mean summer soil temperatures that are less than 12.7 degrees C. and have a perched water table in the upper part of the profile.  Silvies soils do not have argillic horizons, do not have horizons with slickensides, and are influenced by volcanic ash.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wetbag soils are on fan remnants and low stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from altered tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bagval, Heenlake, and Loope soils.  These soils have a xeric moisture regime.  In addition, Heenlake soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and Loope soils are shallow to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained and very poorly drained; very high surface runoff; very slow permeability; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 50 cm (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence classes) from November through June.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  Some areas of these soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wetbag soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly rushes and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 70 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRAs 22A and 26.
