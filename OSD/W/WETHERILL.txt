WETHERILL SERIES

The Wetherill series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from siltstone and sandstone.  Wetherill soils are on plateaus, mesas, cuestas, hills, and terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shiprock Area Soil Survey; San Juan County, New Mexico. 1987.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Argillic horizon: 8 to 152 cm (Bt, Btk1, Btk2, Btk3, Btk4)
Calcic horizon: 107 to 130 cm (Btk3)
Fine-silty family: The loam and clay loam textures in the particle-size control section are dominated by very fine sand. 

Great group rationale:  All pedons have a subhorizon within the argillic horizon that has a clay decrease of more than 20 percent from the maximum clay content, or they lack chroma of 6 or greater.

Wetherill soils have a mesic temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
