WAHATOYA SERIES


The Wahatoya series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from material weathered from conglomeritic sandstone or hard granite.  Wahatoya soils are on mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wahatoya gravelly sandy loam - on a 33 percent northwest facing slope under ponderosa pine and Gambel oak.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oe--0 to 1 inch; moderately decomposed forest litter from twigs and leaves.

    A--1 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones, neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    E--3 to 7 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt--7 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 22 inches thick)

    C--23 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm, nonsticky, and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 7 inches thick)

    R--27 inches; hard conglomeritic sandstone.

Previous classification changed from Typic Eutroboralfs to frigid Typic Haplustalfs.

The 11/2007 revision deletes Douglas-fir from the Use and Vegetation, which returns the vegetation to the original list.
