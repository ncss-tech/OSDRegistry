WIMPER SERIES 

The Wimper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, escarpments, hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 425 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wimper soils are primarily used for rangeland, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, parry danthonia, yellow stonecrop, salsify, American vetch, milkvetch, fringed sagewort, goldenrod, and big sagebrush.  Areas in woodland have an overstory of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and limber pine with an understory of rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Rocky Mountain juniper, and big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Wimper soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRAs - 43A, 43B, 44A and 44B.
