WEISBURG SERIES

The Weisburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying till and residuum weathered from interbedded limestone and calcareous shale. Weisburg soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apalona, Ava, Bedford, Cincinnati, Fountainville, Grantsburg, Hildebrecht, Hosmer, Lawrenceville, Nicholson, Omulga, Otwell, Otwood, Solsberry, and Zanesville series. Apalona, Lawrenceville, Nicholson, Omulga, and Otwood soils do not have part of the argillic horizon formed in till. Ava, Cincinnati, Grantsburg, Hosmer, Otwell, and Zanesville soils have less than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Bedford soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the lower part of the series control section. Fountainville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Hildebrecht soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments within the fragipan. Solsberry soils have sandstone channers in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Weisburg soils are loess-mantled remnants of Illinoian age till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Weisburg soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying till and clayey residuum weathered from interbedded Ordovician limestone and gray calcareous shale of the Dillsboro formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.7 to 13.3 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carmel, Cincinnati, Eden, Rossmoyne, and Switzerland soils. The Carmel, Eden, and Switzerland soils are on hillsides at lower elevations. The sola of these soils do not contain till, and they do not have fragipans. The Cincinnati and Rossmoyne soils are on adjacent but higher and broader ridges which have a thicker mantle of till. The moderately well drained Rossmoyne soils have gray iron depletions above the fragipan. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and low in and below the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and very slow in and below the fragipan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Weisburg soils are cultivated. Corn, wheat, soybeans, and tobacco are the principal crops. A considerable acreage is used for pasture or woodland, or is idle. Native vegetation is deciduous mixed hardwoods including oaks, hickory, tulip poplar, maple, and beech.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mainly in MLRA 114A and to a lesser extent in MLRA 121 in southeastern Indiana.  The type location is in MLRA 114A. The series is of moderate extent.
