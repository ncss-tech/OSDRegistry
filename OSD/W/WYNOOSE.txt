WYNOOSE SERIES

The Wynoose series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on till plains. They formed in loess and the underlying pedisediment overlying a Sangamon age paleosol. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 millimeters (42 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Wynoose soils are on broad ground moraines on till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Wynoose soils formed in 30 to 55 inches (76 to 140 centimeters) of loess and the underlying pedisediment. The loess is late Wisconsin age Peoria Loess and the underlying material is early Wisconsin age pedisediment or Roxana Silt which overlie a strongly developed Sangamon age paleosol in Illinoian age accretion deposits (accretion gley) or till. The paleosol may or may not have been truncated by erosion prior to loess deposition. 

Mean annual temperature--11.7 to 13.9 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F) Mean annual precipitation--965 to 117 millimeters (38 to 46 inches) Frost-free period--180 to 200 days
Elevation--107 to 213 meters (350 to 700 feet) above sea level

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
The moderately well drained Ava soils and the somewhat poorly drained Bluford soils are in a drainage sequence with Wynoose soils, have brittleness in the subsoil, and are on higher positions nearby or on lower positions on backslopes.
Blair and Passport soils are somewhat poorly drained, formed primarily in pedisediment, and are on lower, more sloping positions on backslopes or near the heads of drainageways. 
Hickory soils are well drained, formed in till, and are on lower, more sloping positions on backslopes. 
Racoon soils are fine-silty, have a thicker eluvial horizon, and are on footslopes above or on stream terraces below Wynoose soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained
Water table--Where drained, the water table is within 31 centimeters (1 foot) of the surface between January and May in normal years. If undrained, these soils have a water table within 15 centimeters (0.5 foot) of the surface between November and June in normal years. Wynoose soils can have periods of brief ponding after heavy rains, generally between January and May.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity class--low or moderately low
Permeability class--slow or very slow

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas of Wynoose soils are used to grow soybeans, corn, milo, and wheat. Native vegetation is deciduous forest consisting mainly of post oak, black oak, and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
MLRA 113 in southern Illinois. The series is extensive.
