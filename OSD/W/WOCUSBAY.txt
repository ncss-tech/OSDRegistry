WOCUSBAY SERIES

The Wocusbay series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed material derived from water tolerant herbaceous plants over diatomaceous earth and dacitic pumice in the lower part. The Wocusbay soils are on alluvial fans, basins, and depressions in valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. The similar Yamsay soils have less than 12 inches of limnic materials in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wocusbay soils are on alluvial fans, basins, and depressions in valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,100 to 4,530 feet. The soil formed in material derived from water tolerant herbaceous plants over diatomaceous earth and dacitic pumice in the lower part. The average annual precipitation is 20 to 36 inches. The average annual air temperature is 36 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period is 5 to 30 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chinchallo, Wocus, and Yamsay soils. Chinchallo soils are mineral soils throughout.  Wocus soils are organic throughout, dominantly hemic.  Yamsay soils are organic soils throughout, dominantly sapric with tule vegetation. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; moderate permeability. These soils are frequently ponded for long periods from January to June. Some areas have been drained. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for watershed, recreation and wildlife habitat. A few areas are used for pasture. The potential natural vegetation is tufted hairgrass, sedges and rushes. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon, MLRA 6 and 21. The soils are inextensive.
