WEATHERFORD SERIES

The Weatherford series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone of Cretaceous age. These very gently sloping to strongly sloping soils occur mainly on convex ridges on hills. Slope range is 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Ultic Haplustalfs

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Parker County, Texas, 1973. The name "Weatherford" comes from the seat of government in Parker County, Texas.

REMARKS:
These soils were formerly included in the Stephenville series.

Edited 08/2017 - LAD-CMR: Added soil moisture statements developed using the Java Newhall Simulation Model to the range in characteristics. Added similar climatic statements to geographic setting. Removed references to weakly cemented sandstone in favor of noncemented sandstone.

Edited 11/2014 - RFG/SCP: Converted to tabular format. Updated competing series, associated soils, and geographic setting sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 75 cm (10 to 30 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon: 25 to 114 cm (10 to 45 in) (Bt horizons)
Densic contact: sandstone at 114 cm (45 in) (top of Cd horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Profile No. 44, Soil Survey Laboratory Memorandum No. 2, is of the Weatherford series.
