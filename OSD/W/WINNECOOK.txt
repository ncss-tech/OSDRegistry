WINNECOOK SERIES

The Winnecook series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils formed in glacial till derived primarily from phyllite, slate, or shale. They are on upland till plains and hills. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral soil. Mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is 112 centimeters at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Typic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Winnecook silt loam, on a 12 percent convex slope in a wooded area.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Ap -- 0 to 23 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 10 percent phyllite fragments; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (15 to 25 centimeters thick.)

   Bs1 -- 23 to 41 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very channery silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; common fine roots; 35 percent phyllite fragments; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

   Bs2 -- 41 to 58 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very channery silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; few fine roots; 40 percent phyllite fragments; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

   Bs3 -- 58 to 71 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very channery silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable; few fine roots; 40 percent phyllite fragments; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 25 to 64 centimeters.)

   C -- 71 to 86 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) very channery silt loam; weak medium platy structure; friable; 50 percent phyllite fragments; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 33 centimeters thick.)

   R -- 86 centimeters; fractured phyllite.

TYPE LOCATION: Waldo County, Maine; town of Troy; 1.2 miles north of US Route 202 and Maine Route 9 on Barker Road, 300 yards west of Barker Road. USGS Dixmont, ME topographic quadrangle; Latitude 44 degrees, 41 minutes, 19 seconds N. and Longitude 69 degrees, 13 minutes, 3 seconds W. NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters and thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 89 centimeters. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Rock fragments range from 10 to 70 percent and the weighted average throughout the particle size control section is more than 35 percent by volume. The rock fragments are phyllite, slate, or shale. Stones and boulders cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface.Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.

Most undisturbed pedons have thin O horizons that commonly overlie an E horizon.

The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  

Some pedons have a 1 to 2 inch thick A horizon over an E horizon.  The A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. 

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Consistence is very friable or friable.

The Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, with value 2 to 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.

Some pedons have a BC horizon with color much like the C. Consistence is very friable or friable.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Consistence is very friable, friable, or firm.

The bedrock is generally phyllite, slate, or shale that is fractured in the upper part.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Colosse and Danforth series. Both are very deep to bedrock. Also, Colosse soils developed in glaciofluvial material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winnecook soils are on upland till plains and hills. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. They developed in a moderately deep mantle of till derived principally from phyllite, slate, or shale. Depth to bedrock is 51 to 102 centimeters. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 8 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 86 to 117 centimeters. The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days. Elevations range from 61 to 762 meters above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bangor, Burnham, Dixmont, Monarda, Plaisted, Ragmuff (T), and Thorndike soils. All, except Ragmuff and Thorndike soils, are deeper than 100 centimeters to bedrock, are on lower landscape positions, and have less than 35 percent rock fragments. Ragmuff (T) soils are moderately well drained. Thorndike soils are less than 25 centimeters to bedrock and are on similar or higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Surface runoff is slow to rapid depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral soil.

USE AND VEGETATION: Much of this soil is in forest. Forest vegetation is mainly red spruce, white spruce, balsam fir, sugar maple, paper birch, yellow birch, eastern white pine, and some northern white cedar. Cleared areas are used for cultivated crops, hay, and pasture. Some areas are in urban uses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Maine and New Hampshire. MLRA 143, 144B, and 146. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Amherst, Massachusetts

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Waldo County, Maine, 1979.

REMARKS: 1. Winnecook soils were mapped as Bangor, moderately deep in Penobscot County, Maine soil survey.  Thorndike soils also included some moderately deep soils (Winnecook) in Penobscot and Aroostook Counties, Maine soil surveys.  

2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

a. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters (Ap horizon).
b. Spodic horizon - the zone from 23 to 41 centimeters (Bs1 horizon).
c. Cambic horizon -  the zobe from 41 to 71 centimeters (Bs2 and Bs3 horizons).
