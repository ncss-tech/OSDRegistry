A--0 to 7 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) loam; moderate fine granular structure; friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick) 

Bt1--7 to 26 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; few medium iron concretions; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

Bt2--26 to 37 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) areas of iron accumulations and common medium prominent light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) areas of iron depletions; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

Bt3--37 to 55 inches; 35 percent red (2.5YR 4/6), 35 percent yellowish red (5YR 4/6) areas of iron accumulation, and 30 percent light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) areas of iron depletion, clay loam; strong medium platy structure; firm; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 40 to 60 inches) 

C--55 to 60 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam; common coarse prominent light gray (10YR 7/1) sandy clay iron depletions; massive; firm; strongly acid.

Bt horizon, upper part:
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy clay, clay loam, or clay

Bt horizon, lower part:
Color--hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8

Redoximorphic features: iron depletions in shades of gray or brown and masses of iron accumulation in shades of red or brown 

C horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 or horizon is multicolored in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mattaponi series in the same family and the Cataula and Hard Labor series in a closely related family. Mattaponi soils are formed in Coastal Plain and fluvial sediments and Piedmont cappings and are not subject to seasonal flooding. Cataula and Hard Labor soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and are found on Piedmont uplands. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Piedmont 
Landform: Stream terrace
Geomorphic Component: Tread, riser
Parent Material: Old alluvium
Slope: 0 to 10 percent
Elevation: 300 to 700 feet
Mean Annual Air Temperature (type location): 61 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation (type location): 51 inches 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Altavista soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section; on similar landforms 
Wickham soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section; on similar landforms 
McQueen soils do not have a seasonal high water table within 40 inches of the soil surface; on similar landforms Mattaponi soils do not flood; on convex upland divides 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class (Agricultural): Moderately well drained
Index Surface Runoff: Low to high
Internal Free Water Occurrence: Moderately deep; very transitory
Permeability: Slow 

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Woodland 
Dominant Vegetation: Mixed hardwood and pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Piedmont of Georgia and possibly Alabama and North Carolina
