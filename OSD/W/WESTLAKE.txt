WESTLAKE SERIES

The Westlake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium primarily from loess.   Westlake soils are in flood plains and drainageways, and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Westlake silt loam - on a nearly level slope at 3,100 feet elevation in pasture.  When described on April 30, 1973 the profile was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; many fine irregular pores; few faint masses of iron accumulation; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    A1--8 to 19 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; few medium faint masses of iron accumulation; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    A2--19 to 25 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine, fine, and medium tubular pores; few medium faint masses of iron accumulation; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bg--25 to 48 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; common medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    Cg--48 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common medium distinct yellow (10YR 7/6) to yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation; some thin stratified sandy lenses; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Idaho County, Idaho; about 8 miles northwest of Grangeville; about 1,220 feet north and 1020 feet east of the southwest corner section 20, T. 31 N., R. 2 E.  Latitude - 46 degrees, 00 minutes, 31 seconds North; Longitude - 116 degrees, 14 minutes, 19 seconds West; USGS Nezperce SW Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mollic epipedon thickness - 20 to 35 inches
Depth to sand, gravel, and cobble - greater than 40 inches
Days dry, soil moisture control section - 45 to 65
Average summer soil temperature - 59 to 62 degrees F

A horizon
Value - 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - less than 2
Reaction - slightly acid or neutral
The content of organic matter decreases irregularly with depth

Bg horizon
Value - 5 to 7 dry, 2 to 5 moist
Texture - SIL, SICL, CL, L
Reaction - neutral or slightly alkaline

Cg horizon
Value - 5 to 7 dry, 2 to 5 moist
Texture - SIL, SICL, CL, L
Reaction - neutral or slightly alkaline

Present in some pedons - a 2C horizon of sand, gravel, and cobbles below a depth of 40 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Cald series.  Cald soils have average annual soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Westlake soils are on flood plains and drainageways and have gradients of 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in alluvium primarily from loess.  Elevation is 2,500 to 4,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 to 26 inches.  The average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boles, Nez Perce, Nicodemus, and Wilkins soils.  Boles and Nez Perce soils are moderately well drained, have E horizons, and are on loess hills.  Nicodemus soils are moderately well drained and are on terraces and flood plains.  Wilkins soils have clayey subsoils and are on flood plains and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Westlake soils are used mostly for hay and pasture.   Some areas are used for cropland, mainly for wheat and barley.  Native vegetation is mainly baltic rush, sedge, tufted hairgrass, and common camas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Idaho County, Idaho, 1976.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 25 inches (Ap, A1, A2 horizons).

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of A1, A2, part of Bg horizons).

There is an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.
