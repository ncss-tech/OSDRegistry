REMARKS: Widewater soils were previously mapped as Bibb soils and Mixed Alluvial land.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 cm (A horizon)
Cambic horizon-the zone from 10 to 112 cm (A, Bg, BCg1, BCg2, and BCg3 horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 0 to 178 cm at some time during the year (endosaturation) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Irregular decrease in organic carbon--the zone from 25 to 125 cm has an irregular decrease in content of organic carbon or has 0.2 percent or more organic carbon of Holocene age
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 170 cm  

The 2007 revision adds saturated hydraulic conductivity class, changes the class from moderately high to moderately low, updates the format, and introduces metric units.
