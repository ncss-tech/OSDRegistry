WINGVILLE SERIES

The Wingville series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the surface layer.  They are on alluvial fans and broad alluvial terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wingville silt loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

Ap--0 to 8 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 11 inches thick)

Ak1--8 to 18 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam; dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 inches thick)

Ak2--18 to 23 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; few fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

AC--23 to 33 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; common medium distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

C--33 to 40 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; appears to be mainly volcanic ash; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick)

Cg1--40 to 53 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silty clay loam, gray (5Y 5/1) dry; many fine distinct reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

2Cg2--53 to 60 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) gravelly silt loam, gray (5Y 5/1) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Baker County, Oregon; one mile south of the Wingville community and 600 feet south and 100 feet west of the center of sec. 34, T. 8 S., R. 39 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is silt loam, or silty clay loam and has 22 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to mottles is 10 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The soil is dry throughout the moisture control section for 90 or more consecutive days after the summer solstice.

The A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The soil reaction ranges from mildly or moderately alkaline with slight or strong effervescence.

The C and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, and may be gravelly below 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Athena, La Grande, and Tucannon soils.  Athena soils are well drained.  La Grande soils are moderately well drained, noncalcareous, and have a cambic horizon.  Tucannon soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wingville soils are on alluvial fans and broad alluvial terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 3,600 feet.  Wingville soils formed in mixed alluvium and have an influence of volcanic ash in the upper horizons.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Goodrich, Powval, and Wingdale soils.  Goodrich and Powval are well drained.  Wingdale soils are poorly drained and are on adjacent flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  A water table is present at 18 to 36 inches from March through May.  Flooding is rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wingville soils are used for small grain, hay, and pasture production.  The native vegetation is tufted hairgrass, sedge and Baltic rush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Valleys of eastern Oregon.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Baker Area, Baker County, Oregon, 1941.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and special features:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 inches.  - regular decrease in organic carbon with depth;
(Pachic).
- soil is saturated at 18 to 36 inches from March
through May (Aquic).

Although distinct mottles are present in the lower part of the mollic epipedon (Ak2 and AC horizons 18 to 33 inches), the soil is not saturated and reduced to the soil surface.
