USE: Nearly all areas are wooded.

VEGETATION: Native vegetation is influenced by the frequency of forest fires at each site. Where wildfires have been prevalent, the vegetation is scrub oak, pitch pine, and black jack oaks less than 5 feet tall.  In other areas of less severe fires, the vegetation consists of black, white, and scarlet oaks; pitch, shortleaf, and Virginia pines, and an understory of ericaceous shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION: The eastern part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain in New Jersey

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  New Jersey, Burlington County, 1967

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 17 inches (A, E, and BE horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 2 to 8 inches (E horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 17 to 30 inches (Bt horizon)
