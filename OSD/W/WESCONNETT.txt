WESCONNETT SERIES

The Wesconnett series consists of very deep, very poorly drained sandy soils that formed in sandy deposits on marine terraces.  These soils are in depressions and on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, thermic Typic Alaquods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Wesconnett fine sand on a smooth concave 0.5 percent slope in forest.
(Colors are for moist soil.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; black (10YR 2/1) fine sand; weak fine crumb structure; very friable; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 14 inches thick)

    Bh1--2 to 10 inches; black (N 2/0) fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium splotches of light gray; many clean sand grains; extremely acid; diffuse smooth boundary.

    Bh2--10 to 26 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common splotches of light gray; many clean sand grains; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bh3--26 to 32 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common splotches of light gray; many clean sand grains; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bh horizon is 10 to 40 inches)

    E--32 to 44 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand; common medium distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) mottles; single grained; loose; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 32 inches thick)

    B'h1--44 to 72 inches; reddish black (10R 2/1) fine sand; massive, breaks to weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; sand grains well coated with organic matter; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    B'h2--72 to 80 inches; very dusky red (10R 2/2) fine sand; massive, breaks to weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; sand grains well coated with organic matter. strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Duval County, Florida; 0.3 mile south of Plummer Road 1/8 mile east of Nassau County line.  NW1/4SE1/4NE1/4, Sec. 11, T. 1 S., R. 24 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 30 to 80 inches.  These soils are extremely acid to slightly acid throughout.

The Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1. It is less than 8 inches thick.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or neutral (N), value of 2 to 4.  Mottles of gray or light gray are in some pedons.  Texture is sand, fine sand, mucky sand, or mucky fine sand.

The Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 3 or less, and hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, chroma 2.  The sand grains are well coated with organic matter.  Colors of gray or light gray occur in the Bh horizon of some pedons.  Texture is sand or fine sand. It is massive or has blocky or subangular blocky structure.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 4. In some pedons this layer is a BE horizon.  Texture is sand or fine sand.

The Eg horizon, where present,  has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. In some pedons this layer is a BE horizon.  Texture is sand or fine sand.

The B'h horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 3 or less, and hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, chroma 2.  The sand grains are well coated with organic matter.  Texture is sand or fine sand. It is massive or has blocky or subangular blocky structure.

The C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boulogne, Kingsferry, and Lynn Haven in the same family and the Evergreen series in a similar family.  Boulogne soils are poorly drained.  Lynn Haven and Evergreen soils have a continuous E horizon between the A and Bh horizon.  In addition, Evergreen soils have a histic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wesconnett soils are in level to nearly level concave depressions and on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in sandy marine deposits.  Average annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 65 to 70 degrees F.  The majority of the rainfall is during the summer and late fall.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Boulogne, Leon, Lynn Haven, and Evergreen series and the Ridgeland, Pottsburg, Sapelo, Maurepas, and Pamlico series.  Ridgeland soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Pottsburg and Sapelo soils are poorly drained and have an E horizon between the A and Bh horizon.  Maurepas and Pamlico soils are organic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Wesconnett soils are very poorly drained.  Permeability is rapid in the A and E horizons and moderate or moderately rapid in the B horizons.  Depth of the water table is less than 6 inches or the soil is ponded 4 to 12 months during most years under natural conditions.  Flooding is likely under normal conditions on the flood plains.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is in forest.  Natural vegetation is baldcypress, pondcypress, red maple, sweetbay magnolia, sweetgum, cabbage palm, holly, and water oak, with an understory of waxmyrtle and sparse amounts of creeping bluestem, hairy bluestem, and toothachegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Peninsular Florida and possibly Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  The series is of moderate extent.
