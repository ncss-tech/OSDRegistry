MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina, 2003. 

REMARKS: Westfield soils were previously mapped with the Pacolet and Bethlehem series. Pacolet soils are thermic and are very deep to bedrock. Bethlehem soils are thermic and are moderately deep to paralithic contact. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line necessitated the establishment of the Fairview series (mesic counterpart to the Pacolet series), and the Woolwine series (mesic counterpart to the Bethlehem series). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 28 inches (Bt horizon)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 13 to 35 inches (Bt and BC horizons)
Paralithic contact--bedrock contact at a depth of 48 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 48 to 60 inches (Cr horizon) 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 58 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: No laboratory data available. Data from the nearby Fairview and Woolwine series sites, support the kandic diagnostic horizon and kaolinitic mineralogy. Data from a pedon in Patrick County, Virginia that meets the physical properties for this series had a CEC 7.0/clay ratio of 15.
