WOODROW SERIES

The Woodrow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Woodrow soils are on lake terraces, alluvial fans, alluvial flats, floodplains and in narrow alluvial valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Xeric Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Woodrow silty clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; thin platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified silty clay loam and clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    C--33 to 69 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) stratified silty clay loam and clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4) diffuse irregular boundary. (25 to 66 cm thick)

    Ck--69 to 183 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam laminated with thin lenses of clay loam or silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as fine flakes or mottles; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5)

TYPE LOCATION: Millard County, Utah; about 1 mile west of Flowell.  150 feet east and 2000 feet north of the southwest corner of section 11, T.  15 S., R. 4 W.; USGS Baker Hot Springs, Utah 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 31 minutes 49 seconds N and longitude 112 degrees 16 minutes 23 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Other features: Fine stratification generally occurs throughout the profile. Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 40 percent but is most commonly 15 to 25 percent; slight accumulations of carbonates occur in some pedons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Average 27 to 35 percent
Sand content: Less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 .
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: Commonly 15 to 25 percent, but can range from 10 to 40 percent.

C horizon and Ck horizon present in some pedons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 4.
Texture: Dominantly silty clay loam but thin lenses of silt loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay are common in most pedons. Sandy loam lenses occur in some pedons. 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: Commonly 15 to 25 percent, but can range from 10 to 40 percent.
Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP): 0 to 40 percent.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alovar and Genola series. 

Alovar soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y.  Genola soils have silt loam particle-size control sections with 18 to 27 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on lake terraces, alluvial fans, alluvial flats, flood plains, and in narrow alluvial valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks. Elevation ranges from 1,400 to 1,840 meters.  The climate is semiarid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. and the mean summer temperature ranges from 18 to 23 degrees C. The frost free period ranges from 100 to 160 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deseret, Mellor, McCornick, and Palisade soils and the competing Genola and Oasis soils.  Deseret soils have horizons of gypsum accumulation and are saturated within 100 cm for more than 90 days. Mellor soils have natric horizons. McCornick soils have calcic horizons and more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Palisade soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for irrigated crops and livestock grazing. Crops are mainly alfalfa, small grains, corn, and pasture. Vegetation in the non-cultivated areas is big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, shadscale, snakeweed, and some greasewood. These soils are correlated to semidesert ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Utah and parts of Nevada. MLRA 28A, and 29.  This series is moderately extensive.
