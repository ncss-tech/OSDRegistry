WOODBINE SERIES

The Woodbine series consists of deep, well drained soils on till plains and uplands. These soils formed in thin loess, drift, and residuum from limestone. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum:  commonly 102 to 127 cm (40 to 50 inches) but ranges to 152 cm (60 inches)
Thickness of the loess: typically 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches), the drift is 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick, and their combined thickness is about 91 to 127 cm (36 to 50 inches).
Depth to limestone bedrock: 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) and is considered to be a lithic contact. 
Dominant clay mineral in the loess and upper part of the 2Bt horizon:  smectite. Illite increases with depth and becomes the dominant clay mineral in the lower part of the 2Bt horizon.
Particle-size control section (weighted average): 27 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser material.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amanda, Belmont, Belmore, Caprell, Chili, Cliftycreek, Conestoga, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, High Gap, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, Kosciusko, Leroy, Lumberton, Martinsville, Military, Mocksville, Ockley, Pignut, Princeton, Relay, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Strawn, Wawaka, and Wawasee series. All of these series except Belmont, High Gap, Lumberton, Military, Mocksville, Pignut, and Relay do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Belmont, Lumberton, and Relay series average less than 50 percent clay in the lower part of the solum. High Gap and Military series have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Woodbine soils are on undulating to hilly till plains and moraines that are partially controlled by the underlying limestone bedrock. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. These soils formed in 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches) of Wisconsin age loess, 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of Late Sangamon age paleosols that formed in Illinoian drift, and 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 inches) of residuum from weathered limestone bedrock.  Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 970 mm (32 to 38 inches) per year. Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dubuque, Fayette, Flagg, Hitt, Myrtle, Oneco, Pecatonica, and Westville soils. Myrtle, Flagg, and Fayette soils commonly are on ridgetops above the Woodbine soils where the loess is thicker. Pecatonica and Westville soils are on similar landscape positions where the drift is thicker. Dubuque soils are associated in some places on steeper slopes or on similar slopes where glacial deposits do not occur above the bedrock. Woodbine is the light colored member of a biosequence containing Oneco soils (Mollic Hapludalfs and Hitt soils (Typic Argiudolls). 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.22 micrometers per second) in the loess and till and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the residuum. Permeability is moderate in the loess and slow in the residuum. Surface runoff potential is low to high as related to slope. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for cultivated crops such as corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow and for pasture and woodland. Native vegetation is hardwood trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Illinois. LRRs K and M, MLRAs 95B, 105, 108B, and 115C. The series of moderate extent.
