WEGLIKE SERIES

The Weglike soils consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Weglike soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Weglike ashy loamy sand--on a nearly level plain at about 1,345 meters elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described in June of 1994, the soil was dry throughout).

(5 to 18 cm thick)

    AB--8 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and common medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 25 percent very pale brown (10YR 7/3) coarse and very coarse sand-size pumiceous ash grains; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary.

(20 to 36 cm thick)

    2Bwb2--56 to 58 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and coarse roots; common medium tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt irregular boundary.  (0 to 23 cm thick)

    2R--58 cm; fractured tuff-breccia.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weglike soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,435 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abert, Kunceider, Morehouse, Suckerflat, and Wegert soils. Abert and Morehouse are very deep. Kunceider and Suckerflat are shallow to bedrock. Wegert soils have less than 15 percent volcanic glass in the buried cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Weglike soils are used for irrigated cropland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Alfalfa hay and barley are the principal crops.  The vegetation in rangeland is mainly basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County (Northern Part), Oregon, 2006.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A and AB horizons).
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A and AB horizons).
Buried cambic horizon - The zone from 30 to 58 cm (2Bwb1 and 2Bwb2 horizons).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 58 cm to underlying hard bedrock (2R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 58 cm (2Bwb1 and 2Bwb2 horizons and part of the AB horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Volcanic glass content of the buried horizons determined locally by optical grain count with a polarizing petrographic microscope.
