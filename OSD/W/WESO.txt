WESO SERIES

The Weso series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  The Weso soils are on beach plains, relic lagoons, fan skirts, inset fans and fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Broyles, Crockies, Gardenvalley, Keefa, and Strike series.  

Broyles soils have durinodes in a friable matrix.  Crockies soils have bedrock within 150 cm. Gardenvalley and Keefa soils are moist 10 to 20 days cumulative in the summer. Strike soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weso soils are on beach plains, relic lagoons, fan skirts, inset fans and fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bliss, Dun Glen, Rad and Valmy soils.  Bliss soils have a strongly cemented hardpan at a depth of 50 to 91 cm.  Dun Glen soils lack silica cementation.  Rad soils have silty particle-size control sections with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser particles.  Valmy soils lack cambic horizons and have durinodes in a friable matrix.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well-drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, spiny hopsage, black greasewood, bottlebrush squirreltail and cheatgrass.  A few small areas are used for irrigated crop land.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  MLRA 24.  These soils are moderately extensive.
