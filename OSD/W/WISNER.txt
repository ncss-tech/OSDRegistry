WISNER SERIES

The Wisner series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Wisner loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field cropped to navy beans on a till plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate coarse granular structure; firm; few fine roots; 1 percent by volume of gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches) thick]

 Bg--20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; common medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; 4 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [8 to 33 cm (3 to 13 inches) thick]

 Cg1--46 to 107 cm (18 to 42 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam; weak coarse angular blocky fragments; firm; common coarse faint pale brown (10YR 6/3) and common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 4 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 Cg2--107 to 152 cm (42 to 60 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam; weak thick platy fragments; firm; common medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; 4 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Arenac County, Michigan; about 1 mile south of Pine River; 720 feet east and 400 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 16, T. 18 N., R. 5 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 28 to 69 cm (11 to 27 inches)
Reaction: the upper 25 cm (10 inches) may be slightly alkaline or neutral and without effervescence in some pedons
Rock fragment content: 1 to 8 percent gravel and cobbles throughout 

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: clay loam, loam, or sandy loam

Bg horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam or clay loam

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wisner soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Wisner soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 864 mm (29 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the poorly drained or very poorly drained Sims soils in similar landscape positions. Sims soils are in a fine family and lack effervescence between a depth of 25 and 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, sugar beets, beans, and small grains are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in east central Lower Michigan. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Arenac County, Michigan, 1965.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 inches) (Bg horizon).
Effervescence in all parts of the control section.
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below the mollic epipedon.
