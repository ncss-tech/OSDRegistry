WILSEY SERIES

The Wilsey series consists of very deep well drained soils on flood plains and upland drainageways. These soils formed in calcareous alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Mollic Udifluvents

Kennebec--are in the lower elevations, have a saturated zone between depths of 91 to 183 centimeters (3 to 6 feet) during March to June in most years, and do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches)
Napier--are in the higher elevations on foot slopes adjacent to uplands, have a mollic epipedon 61 to 102 centimeters (24 to 40 inches) thick, do not have carbonates within a depth of 91 centimeters (36 inches), and do not have buried horizons
Rawles--are in landform positions similar to those of the Wilsey soils and have a saturated zone between depths of 61 to 122 centimeters (2 to 4 feet) during March to June in most years
Smithland--are in the lower elevations, have a saturated zone between depths of 30 to 91 centimeters (1 to 3 feet) during November to July in most years, and do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches)

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--well drained--a saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 183 centimeters (6 feet) in most years
Permeability--moderate
Surface runoff potential--very low or low
Flooding--occasional or rare flooding for brief or very brief periods during the months of February to November resulting from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. A few areas are in permanent pasture. The native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.
