WORK SERIES

The Work series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  Work soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, relict stream terraces, plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.
