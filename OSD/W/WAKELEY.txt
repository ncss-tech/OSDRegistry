WAKELEY SERIES

The Wakeley series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits underlain by clayey lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over clayey, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, frigid Aeric Epiaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Wakeley muck, on a 1 percent slope in a forested area on a lake plain at an elevation of about 1,115 feet above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oa--0 to 10 cm (4 inches); black (N 2.5/) broken face and rubbed muck; about 15 percent fiber, 10 percent rubbed; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; about 10 percent uncoated sand grains in lower portion of this horizon; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 18 cm (7 inches) thick]

 C--10 to 58 cm (4 to 23 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy sand; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; loose; common fine roots; few medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions throughout; few coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; about 2 percent coarse gravel and 1 percent cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [15 to 71 cm (6 to 28 inches) thick]

 Cg--58 to 71 cm (23 to 28 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loamy sand; massive; friable; many medium and coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron throughout; about 5 percent medium and coarse gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 50 cm (20 inches) thick]

 2C1--71 to 147 cm (28 to 58 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay; massive; firm; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; many medium and coarse prominent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) iron depletions throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 2C2--147 to 203 cm (58 to 80 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) clay; massive; firm; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; few fine distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Crawford County, Michigan; about 13 miles east-southeast of the city of Grayling; 1,650 feet east and 400 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 12, T. 25 N., R. 2 W., west part South Branch Township; USGS Roscommon North, Michigan topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 34 minutes 13.01 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 30 minutes 17.22 seconds W., NAD 27.

2C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 2.5Y

Some pedons have 2Cg horizons with sandy clay texture.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wakeley soils are on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Wakeley soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits underlain by clayey lacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains and outwash plains. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allendale, Au Gres, Croswell, Leafriver, Manistee, and Tawas soils. The somewhat poorly drained Allendale and the well drained Manistee soils are in the same drainage sequence. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and the moderately well drained Croswell soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Leafriver and Tawas soils are in depressions or on similar landscape positions and have a thicker mantle of organic material.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very in the sandy material and low or moderately low in the clayey material. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and slow or very slow in the clayey material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are forested. Common tree species include quaking aspen, speckled alder, willow, black spruce, balsam fir, and northern white cedar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in northern Lower Michigan and MLRA 94B in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and in northwestern Wisconsin. This series is of moderate extent.
