WOODTELL SERIES

The Woodtell series consists of soils that are deep to stratified loamy and clayey residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  They are well drained and very slowly permeable.  These soils are gently sloping to moderately steep which occur on interfluves and side slopes of ridges on inland dissected coastal plains.  The slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1244 mm (49 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing  Etoile series, and the Annona, Bryarly, Bernaldo, Freestone, LaCerda, Naclina, Wolfpen, and Raino series. 
Annona and Brylarly soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and very slowly permeable.  Runoff is Very High on slopes of 1 to greater than 20 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for pasture.  Native vegetation is mainly postoak, blackjack oak, elm and red oak in a fairly dense savannah.  In open areas tall and mid grasses such as bluestems, tridens and panicums are common with longleaf uniola under the tree canopy.  American beautyberry and hawthorn species are also a part of the understory.  The main pasture plants are bermudagrass and bahiagrasse with crimson and arrowleaf clovers.  There are scattered shortleaf and loblolly pine with small plantations and some dense pine areas on the eastern side of the series province.  Some areas are planted to small grain for winter grazing.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Texas; Land Resource Region J - Southwestern Prairies Cotton and Forage Region; MLRA 87B - Texas Claypan Areas, Nouthern Part.  Also parts of Arkansas and Oklahoma.  The series is extensive.
