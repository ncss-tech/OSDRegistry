WILDHORSE SERIES

The Wildhorse series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in eolian sand on swales and hummocks on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Halaquepts

COMPETING SERIES: Lewellen is the only soil in this family. 
Lewellen soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvium deposited 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) thick over coarse sand and are on floodplains. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: eolian sand, 
Landform: swales and hummocks on interdunes

Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C. (46 to 50 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Els, Hoffland, Ipage, Marlake, and Valentine soils. 
All of these soils do not have ESP greater than 15 or SAR of 13 or more in half or more of the soil volume within 50 centimeters (20 inches) of the mineral soil surface.
Els soils are on similar somewhat poorly drained swales on interdunes.
Hoffland soils are on slightly lower swales on interdunes and are poorly and very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface and having ponding on the very poorly drained soil up to 15 centimeters (6 inches).
Ipage soils are on slightly higher swales and hummocks on interdunes and are moderately well drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 91 centimeters (36 inches).
Marlake soils are in depressions on interdunes and are very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface and having ponding up to 61 centimeters (24 inches). 
Valentine soils are on higher dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: somewhat poorly drained
Runoff: negligible
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: very high 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and haying. The rangeland native plant community for the saline subirrigated ecological site (R065XY025NE) is principally inland saltgrass alkali sacaton, foxtail barley, and switchgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The western sandhills of Nebraska (MLRA 65, LRR G). The series is of moderate extent.

3/2009 RRH: A stream terrace phase or another series or a new series is needed to represent the Wildhorse soils mapped on stream terraces.
3/2009 RRH: Introduction: Revised sentences pertaining to landforms, landscapes, and parent materials. Typical Pedon: Changed to moist colors. Revised horizon nomenclatures. Range of Characteristics: Revised. Geographically Associated Soils: Deleted Elsmere, Lisco, and Selia soils as not near type location and added Marlake soils which are. Revised all definitions. Use and Vegetation: Revised. Diagnostic horizons: revised. 
ADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon (78NE123002) was analyzed by the National Soil Survey Center Soil Survey Laboratory. Six other pedons from Sheridan County, Nebraska have been analyzed by the SSL.
