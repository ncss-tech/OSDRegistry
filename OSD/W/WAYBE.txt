WAYBE SERIES

The Waybe series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from clayey shale.  These soils are on foothills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, shallow Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Waybe clay loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak thin plates parting to moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 12 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) silty clay loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; strong very fine blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 13 inches thick)

    BC--12 to 18 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) silty clay loam, gray (5Y 5/1) moist; weak medium to very thick platy structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; 40 percent soft shale fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Cr--18 to 60 inches, white (5Y 8/2) shale, that crushes to silty clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Waybe soils are on foothills and mountain slopes.  Elevations are 4,500 to 6,700 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from clayey shale.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.  In Colorado the elevations are 7,200 to 8,600 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Waybe soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is western wheatgrass, blue grama, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Waybe soils are of moderate extent in central Montana, Wyoming and Colorado.  MLRAs 43B, 46 and 48A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cascade County, Montana, 1975.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0032, MT0763, and MT0214. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (A horizon) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 18 inches (part of Bw1 and BC horizons)
Paralithic contact - the zone starting at a depth of 18 inches.  

Waybe soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
