WUKSACHI SERIES

The Wuksachi series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Wuksachi soils are on flood plains and low flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1080 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, isotic, euic, mesic Terric Haplosaprists

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wuksachi soils are on concave to linear treads of flood plains and low flood-plain steps. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 1520 to 2130 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 535 to 1165 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to11 degrees C. The frost free season is 120 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wobonuch soils. The Wobonuch soils are on floodplain steps and are somewhat poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, moderately high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Frequent flooding for brief (2 to 7 days) duration beginning in April, frequent ponding for long (7 to 30 days) duration beginning in April. Seasonal high water table to 0 cm (soil surface)

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is panicled bulrush, common spikerush, western cowbane, narrow leaved lotus, and knotweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
