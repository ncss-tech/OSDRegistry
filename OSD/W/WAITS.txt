WAITS SERIES

The Waits series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on moraines and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Waits ashy loam - forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oe--0 to 4 cm; loose, partially decomposed organic litter composed of needles, leaves, and twigs; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    E--4 to 5 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) ashy very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (.3 to 3 cm thick)

    Bw1--5 to 22 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) ashy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium, and few coarse roots; many fine pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw2--22 to 47 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) ashy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium, and few coarse roots; many fine pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    2BC--47 to 62 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium, and few coarse roots; many fine pores; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 28 cm thick)

    2C1--62 to 95 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common fine pores; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 38 cm thick)

    2C2--95 to 152 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine pores; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahren, Belzar, Bonner, Donavan, Eloika, Nevine, Smackout, and the competing Aits soils. Ahren and Smackout soils are fine-loamy. Belzar and Nevine soils are loamy-skeletal. Bonner soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Donavan soils have a mollic epipedon and a mesic soil temperature regime. Eloika soils are medial over loamy and a mesic soil temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly timber with cleared areas used for hay, pasture, and grain. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, western larch, grand fir, quaking aspen, Rocky Mountain maple, kinnikinnick, strawberry, redstem ceanothus, pinegrass, wild rose, hazelnut, Oregon-grape, and mallow ninebark.
