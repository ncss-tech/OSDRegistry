WESPUR SERIES

The Wespur series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous alluvium of Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping floodplains in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E).  The slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Torrifluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Wespur loam - on a 1 percent linear slope, on tread of flood plain step, in native rangeland at an elevation of 725 m (2379 ft).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Permeability: moderate
Runoff: negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for both cropland and livestock grazing. Principal crops are wheat, grain sorghum, alfalfa, and sorghum/sudan grass.  Native vegetation is predominantly purple threeawn, little bluestem, silver bluestem, side oats grama, sand bluestem, blue grama, and broom snakeweed.  Yucca is the major woody species along with small amounts of sand sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA-77E in LRR H) of northwestern Oklahoma, the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and adjacent areas of Southwestern Kansas.  This soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Beaver County, OK 2008.  The name of the series comes from a contraction of the words "West" and "Spur".   

REMARKS: 
These soils were formerly included in the Spur series.
