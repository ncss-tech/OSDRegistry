WALDROUP SERIES

The Waldroup series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from basaltic cinders and ash. Waldroup soils are on cinder cones, cinder beds and basalt flows. Slopes are dominantly 10 to 25 percent but range to 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Rhodustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Waldroup gravelly silty clay loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 2 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) gravelly light silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 2/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky, plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 45 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobblestones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

(0 to 12 inches thick.)

     C--38 to 50 inches; mottled red (2.5YR 5/8), gray (2.5Y 6/1) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) weathered cinders.

TYPE LOCATION:  Yavapai County, Arizona; SW 1/4 NE 1/4 Sec. 21, T. 13 N., R. 7E and 150 feet west of local road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Thickness of the solum: 20 to 48 inches

Depth to the C horizon: usually 20 to 30 inches and it ranges from 20 to 60 inches. The deeper soils are usually on colluvial slopes or lower slopes of cinder cones.

Soil Moisture: In most years these soils are dry in some subhorizon between 7 and 20 inches for 90 or more cumulative days but they are not dry in all parts between these depths for as long as 60 consecutive days. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 51 degrees to 54 degrees F.

The gravel in this soil is basaltic cinders.

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 5YR
Value: 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, light clay loam, gravelly silt loam or gravelly silty clay loam

Bt horizon
The Bt (argillic) horizon has hue redder than 5YR and moist value of less than 4.
Hue: 2.5YR
Value: 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 4 through 6
Texture: dominantly clay but ranges from heavy clay loam to clay or gravelly clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Waldroup soils are on cinder cones, cinder beds and basalt flows at elevations of 5000 to 6800 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 10 to 25 percent and range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils are formed from basaltic cinders and ash and some material from basalt flows.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 to 55 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Brolliar, Gem, Sponseller, and Ziegler soils these are the Lynx and Springerville soils.  Lynx and Springerville soils lack B2t horizons, and Lynx soils, in addition, have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium.  Permeability is moderately slow to slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and watersheds.  Vegetation is juniper, oakbrush, mountain mahogany, cliffrose, snakeweed, blue grama, Arizona fescue and widely spaced prickly pear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Arizona and possibly New Mexico.   The series is of moderate extent. MLRA 39.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Beaver Creek Area, Coconino and Yavapai Counties, Arizona, 1965.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon) 

Argillic horizon - The zone from 7 to 38 inches (Btk1, Btk2 horizons) 

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

The classification was changed from Udic subgroup to Typic subgroup in 2007. The change was made to be consistent with the moisture regime.
