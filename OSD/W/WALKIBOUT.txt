WALKIBOUT SERIES

The Walkibout series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from micaceous sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate.  Walkibout soils are on backslopes of gulches.  Slopes are 25 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Keota, Mitchell, and Truxton (T) series.  Keota soils have soft bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Mitchell soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section in May and June.  Truxton soils have texture of silt loam in the particle-size control section, have hue of 10YR, have mean annual soil temperature of 57 to 59 degrees F., and occur on flood plains.  In addition, all of these soils do not have significant amounts of mica in the silt and sand fractions.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Walkibout soils are on backslopes of gulches.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate.  Slopes are 25 to 80 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Innacutt, Koshare, and El Rancho soils.  Innacutt soils are coarse-loamy, do not have ochric epipedons, and occur on inset fans and narrow flood plains.  Koshare soils are coarse-loamy, have cambic horizons, and occur on toeslopes.  El Rancho soils are fine-silty, have cambic horizons, and occur on toeslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Walkibout soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is Indian ricegrass, galleta, western wheatgrass, fourwing saltbush, and winterfat.  The ecological site is Limy (R036XB129NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Walkibout soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
