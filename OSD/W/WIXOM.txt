WIXOM SERIES

The Wixom series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy material and the underlying loamy till or lacustrine deposits on till plains, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 920 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Alfic Epiaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Wixom loamy sand, on a south-facing, 2 percent slope in a residential area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

(0 to 20 cm thick) 

 2Bt2--69 to 79 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam; weak medium platy structure parting to weak very fine subangular blocky; firm; gray (5Y 6/1) coatings on faces of peds; many coarse prominent gray (5Y 5/1) iron depletions; about 3 percent gravel and cobbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 36 cm thick) 

 2C--79 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam; weak medium plates parting to weak fine subangular blocks of geogenic origin; firm; gray (5Y 6/1) coatings on faces of peds; many coarse prominent gray (5Y 6/1) iron depletions; about 3 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar series include the Avoca, Bixler, Markton, Rapson, Rimer, and Selfridge series. None of these soils have a spodic horizon. The Avoca and Rapson soils do not have an argillic horizon. Rimer soils have densic material within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wixom soils are on till plains, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent, but range from 0 to 6 percent. They formed in 50 to 100 cm of sandy sediments and in the underlying loamy till or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 770 to 1040 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belleville, Capac, Ithaca, and Pipestone soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Belleville soils are in depressions and do not have a spodic horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Capac and Ithaca soils are on similar landform positions and do not have sandy materials in the upper part of the series control section. The somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils are on similar landform positions and have sandy materials throughout the series control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is very low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately high in the underlying loamy material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: About 80 percent of the area of this soil is cultivated or is in pasture. The remainder is in woodland. Corn, oats, wheat, and legume hay are the principle crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood, predominantly American elm, white ash, and swamp white oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 97, and 98 in the southern half of Lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
