WILSON SERIES

The Wilson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium of Pleistocene age derived from mudstone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on treads of Pleistocene stream terraces. Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1003 mm (39.5 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.1 degrees C (64.6 degrees F).

Runoff: high on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 5 percent slopes.  Very slow internal drainage. 
Wetness: The soil is seasonally wet and is saturated in the surface layer and upper part of the Bt horizon during the winter and spring seasons for periods of 10 to 30 days.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for cropland.  Common crops are cotton, sorghum, small grains, and corn.  Many previously cropped areas are now used for unimproved pasture.  Native vegetation consists of little bluestem, yellow indiangrass, big bluestem, Texas wintergrass, vine mesquite, Florida paspalum, Virginia wildrye, silver bluestem, and sideoats grama and widely spaced motts of elm and oak trees. Most areas that are not cropped have few to many mesquite trees.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Wilson County, Texas; 1907.

REMARKS: Classification change from Udertic Haplustalfs to Oxyaquic Vertic Haplustalfs based on knowledge that these soils are saturated for 2 to 4 weeks in most years. This period of time is within the definition of saturation for one month or more if rules of rounding are applied, i.e., 2 to 6 weeks saturation is considered inclusive.

Linear Extensibility: The linear extensibility is greater than 6 cm (2.5 in) within 102 cm (40 in) of the soil surface. 
Coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE): 0.07 to 0.10 in the upper 127 cm (50 in) of the argillic horizon. 
Other Features: The surface layer is variable in thickness with a series of micro crests and troughs in the Bt horizon that range from 1.2 to 6.1 m (4 to about 20 ft) apart. The soil does not have aquic soil conditions in the upper 51 cm (20 in) in most years.
