WYNOTT SERIES

The Wynott series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with slow permeability. They formed in residuum from gabbro, diorite, and other dark colored mafic rocks. These soils are on uplands in the Piedmont. Slope ranges from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. near the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Typic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Wynott sandy loam--on a 4 percent slope in a mixed hardwood forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many large roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

   E--4 to 7 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many large and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Randolph County, North Carolina; about 1.8 miles southwest of Hillsville on Secondary Road 1408, about 2.0 miles west and northwest on Secondary Road 1547, about 0.4 mile east on Secondary Road 1545, and 75 feet north of Secondary Road 1545, in woods; Glenola, North Carolina USGS topographic quadrangle; lat. 35 degrees 50 minutes 15 seconds N. and long. 79 degrees 58 minutes 37 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to paralithic contact with soft, weathered bedrock (Cr) ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to a lithic contact with hard, unweathered bedrock (R) ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Rock fragments (mostly diabase), iron and manganese concretions, and quartz pebbles, are less than 35 percent in the A horizon and less than 40 percent in individual subhorizons of the B and in the C horizon. Some areas have numerous stones or boulders on the surface. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid except where surface layers have been limed. 

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam. Where eroded, it is sandy clay loam, clay loam, in the fine-earth fraction.

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam, in the fine earth fraction.

The EB or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, in the fine-earth fraction.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. In some pedons it has mottles in shades of yellow or brown. Texture is clay loam, silty clay, sandy clay, or clay, in the fine-earth fraction.

The BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or it is mottled or multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, black, or white. Texture is sandy clay, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam, in the fine-earth fraction.

The C horizon, where present, is mottled or multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, black, or white. It is variable in texture but commonly is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam, in the fine-earth fraction.

The Cr horizon is multicolored, weathered mafic rock that is partially consolidated but can be dug with difficulty with a spade.

The R horizon, where present, is unweathered, hard mafic rock. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Archer, Bradyville, Conasauga, Gladdice, Mimosa, Talbott, and Winnsboro series. Archer soils formed in marine sediments overlying soft limestone and have a lithologic discontinuity between 30 and 55 inches.  Bradyville soils formed in residuum of limestone and have red or
yellowish red Bt horizons. Conasauga soils formed in residuum of shale and limestone, contain shale fragments in the lower solum, and are moderately well drained.  Winnsboro soils have weathered bedrock between 40 and 60 inches. Gladdice soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone and have hard bedrock at less than 40 inches. Mimosa soils formed in residuum from phosphatic limestone and are higher in content of phosphorous. Talbott soils formed in residuum from limestone and have hard bedrock at less than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wynott soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands in the Piedmont. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from gabbro, diorite, diabase, and similar dark colored mafic rocks. The average annual rainfall ranges from 38 to 52 inches, and the mean
annual air temperature ranges from about 57 to 65 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Enott and Winnsboro series in the same family and the Brewback, Crawfordville, Cullen, Enon, Frogsboro, Iredell, Mecklenburg, Pittsboro, Poindexter, Sedgefield, Virgilina, and Wilkes series. All of these series except Iredell and Sedgefield occur on similar landscapes. Frogsboro, Iredell, and Sedgefield soils occur in depressions, around heads of drains, and in lower landscape positions.   Brewback soils have iron depletions in the upper Bt horizon.  Cullen, Enon, Iredell, Mecklenburg, and Sedgefield soils do not have weathered bedrock within 60 inches. Cullen and Mecklenburg soils have red Bt horizons. Poindexter soils are fine-loamy. Pittsboro soils have redoximorphic features including iron depletions between 30 and 40 inches. Sedgefield soils have redoximorphic features including iron depletions within 10 inches of the top of the Bt horizon. Virgilina soils have hard bedrock between 20 and 40 inches and have smectitic mineralogy. Wilkes soils have weathered bedrock between 10 and 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; and slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: About one-fourth of this soil is cleared and used for corn, soybeans, small grain, and pasture. Forested areas are mainly southern red oak, white oak, willow oak, hickory, loblolly pine, sweetgum, and yellow-poplar. Understory species include eastern red cedar, flowering dogwood, eastern redbud, and sassafras.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Piedmont area of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richmond County, North Carolina; 1995. The source of the name is a local community in the vicinity of the type location in Randolph County, North Carolina. 

REMARKS: This series was formerly included with the Zion series. Zion soils have hard, unweathered bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are now mesic due to the thermic/mesic break in MLRA 136. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 14 inches (Ap, E, and EB horizons). 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 28 inches (Bt and BC horizon). 
Paralithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 28 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon number S93NC-151-001.
