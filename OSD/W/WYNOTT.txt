SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia. 
Extent: Moderate 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richmond County, North Carolina; 1995. The source of the name is a local community in the vicinity of the type location in Randolph County, North Carolina.

REMARKS: This series was formerly included with the Zion series. Zion soils have hard, unweathered bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are now mesic due to the thermic/mesic break in MLRA 136. The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular. No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 36 centimeters (0 to 14 inches) (Ap, E, and EB horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 36 to 71 centimeters (14 to 28 inches) (Bt and BC horizon).
Paralithic contact--the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 71 centimeters (28 inches) (upper boundary of the Cr horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon number S93NC-151-001.
