WABASH SERIES

The Wabash series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--poorly drained and very poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated from the soil surface to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest period of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.01 to 0.10 micrometers per second
Flooding--rare to frequent flooding for brief to long periods can occur in any month during the year due to precipitation events and snowmelt
Ponding--rare to frequent ponding, up to 0.15 meters in depth, for brief to long periods can occur in any month during the year due to precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Drained areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. The native vegetation is big bluestem, western wheatgrass, sedges, blue grama, other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness, and scattered deciduous trees.
