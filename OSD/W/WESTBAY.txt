SERIES PROPOSED: Galveston County, Texas, 2022. The name is coined from West Galveston Bay (West Bay).

REMARKS: The series was formerly included with water. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section--0 to 100 cm (0 to 40 in) 
Ochric epipedon--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Oase and Aseg horizons)
Sulidic materials--0 to 23 cm (Oaseg and Aseg horizons) 
Peraquic feature--0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) (Oaseg, Aseg horizon and Cglayers are permanently saturated)

Additional Comments--Mineralogy based on amount of shell fragments observed. Tests to validate the sulfidic materials were not available at the time of the collection of these soils. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil survey office lab data on pedon S2020TX1679012 from series type location.
