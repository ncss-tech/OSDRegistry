WAYWEST SERIES

The Waywest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced alluvium derived from mixed sources. Waywest soils are on valley floors and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Waywest silt loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A1--0 to 6 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2), moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.                                                        

     A2--6 to 22 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary. 

     AB--22 to 45 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. 

     Bw1--45 to 60 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual wavy boundary. 

     Bw2--60 to 110 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; few very fine and fine irregular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

     Bw3--110 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loamy fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).
