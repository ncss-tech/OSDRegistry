WILLIAMSTOWN SERIES

The Williamstown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. The soils formed in as much as 56 cm (22 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Williamstown silt loam, on a convex, 4 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 255 meters (835 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); 90 percent brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry, and 10 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam subsoil material; moderate medium granular structure; friable; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

Bogart, Haney, and Thackery soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Centerburg soils have rock fragments dominantly of sandstone or shale lithology. Cygnet and Jenera soils average more than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the control section. Houcktown and Vanlue soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to a densic contact. Jugtown soils have rock fragments of sandstone, chert, and shale lithology. Nicely and Passport soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Scattersville, Swampoodle, and Vallonia soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Tuscola soils contain less than 1 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Williamstown soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Williamstown soils formed in loamy till that can be capped with up to 56 cm (22 inches) of loess. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1118 mm (34 to 44 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 12.2 degrees C (47 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 190 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brookston, Crosby, Fincastle, Miami, and Treaty soils. The poorly drained Brookston and Treaty soils are in lower lying depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Crosby and Fincastle soils are on summits below the Williamstown soils. The Miami soils are on higher lying summits or lower lying, more sloping backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched high water table ranges from 30 to 76 cm (1.0 to 2.5 feet) during the winter and early spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low to very high depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low or low in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. A small acreage is in small grain, hay, pasture, or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111A, 111C, and 111D in Indiana, and of lesser extent in MLRAs 98 and 111B in Michigan. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent.
