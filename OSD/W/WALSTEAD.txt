WALSTEAD SERIES

The Walstead series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous till or alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, moraines, outwash terraces, eskers and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Walstead soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, moraines, outwash terraces, eskers and glaciated mountain slopes.  Elevations are 2,790 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous till or alluvium.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Walstead soils are used mainly for irrigated and nonirrigated crops, pastureland, and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Walstead soils are of small extent in the mountain valleys of northwestern Montana. MLRA 44.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County Montana, 1972.  Walstead is a place name.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0038 and MT0754.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 15 inches (A1 and AB horizons); a cambic horizon from 15 to 36 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); a calcic horizon from 36 to 44 inches (Bk1 horizon); and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (AB, Bw1, Bw2, and Bk1 horizons).  Walstead soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
