Depth to the top of the spodic horizon: 8 to 36 cm below mineral surface (3 to 14 inches).
Depth to the base of the spodic horizon: 20 to 81 cm below mineral surface (8 to 32 inches).
Solum Thickness: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).
Depth to Bedrock: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).
Depth Class: Moderately deep.
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: Greater than 183 cm (72 inches).
Depth to Lithologic Discontinuity (if present):   51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)

The weighted average of the rock fragments in the control section is greater than 35 percent by volume.
Soil Reaction: Ultra acid to very strongly acid, unless limed.
Other Soil Features:  In most pedons, the horizons in the upper part of the solum have been mixed by tree throws, soil creep, or a combination of these processes. The upper solum commonly contains mixed or combined horizons and horizons with broken or irregular boundaries. Rarely are horizons in the upper solum homogeneous. Therefore, the properties described in the Range of Individual Horizons can and should be applied to discrete parts of intermingled horizons.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pocahontas County, West Virginia, 2014.

REMARKS: Wildell soils were previously mapped as moist phases of the Berks or Dekalb soil series in out-of-date soil surveys in West Virginia. Wildell soils are found on cool, moist landscapes. They have a perudic or near-perudic soil moisture regime and a frigid soil temperature regime. Although some areas of these soils are currently covered by northern hardwood forests, they are thought to have formed under a canopy that was at least 50 percent conifer (red spruce and/or eastern hemlock). 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Folistic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches) (Oi, Oe, Oa horizons).
Spodic horizon--the zone from 29 to 50 cm (Bhs/Bh and Bs/Bhs horizons).
Skeletal feature--Approximately 39 percent (by volume) weighted average rock fragments in the 25 to 98 centimeters (10 to 39 inches) control section.
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 98 centimeters (0 to 39 inches). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the KSSL for the Typical Pedon: 
Pedon No. 12N8061. Other valuable reference pedons available from the KSSL: 12N8058, 12N8059.  Additional data is available from the USFS Monongahela National Forest Soil Resource program and WVU.
