WATUSI SERIES

The Watusi series consists of moderately deep, well drained moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt.  These soils are on basalt flows and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Xeric Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Watusi loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure that parts to weak fine subangular blocky; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine and many micro interstitial pores; l5 percent gravel; moderately calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary.  (3 inches thick.)

    B2--3 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few medium and fine and common very fine roots; few medium and fine tubular and common very fine and many micro interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    C1ca--6 to 12 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky, plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine and micro interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; strongly calcareous, carbonates are weakly cemented; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

    C2ca--12 to 24 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) clay loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and many micro tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; very strongly calcareous, carbonates are strongly cemented; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 15 inches thick)

    C3ca--24 to 35 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; strongly calcareous, carbonates are moderately cemented; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to l2 inches thick)

    C4cam--35 inches, indurated carbonate hardpan.

TYPE LOCATION:  Iron County, Utah; about 2 1/2 miles east of Rush Lake; about 490 feet north and 650 feet east of the west 1/4 corner of Section 4, T. 34 S., R. 10 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 F.  The A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 15 percent gravel.

The B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 15 percent gravel.  The texture is loam or clay loam.

The C horizon has chroma of 2 through 4.  It is weakly to strongly cemented with carbonates.  The carbonates range from 40 to 60 percent.  Textures are clay loam, loam and gravelly loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are Denmark and Oakden series.  These soils are less than 20 inches deep to the carbonate cemented hardpan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Watusi soils are on alluvial fans at elevations of 5,500 to 6,000 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium from basalt.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 51 F. and the average annual precipitation is 9 to ll inches.  The freeze-free season is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Saxby soils.  Saxby soils have basalt bedrock at a depth of l0 to 20 inches and have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is black sagebrush, big sagebrush, yellowbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass and mustard.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Utah.  Watusi soils are inextensive.  The name is coined.
