WOODTICK SERIES

The Woodtick series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands deposits.  These soils occur on dunes. Slopes are 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 390 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed Typic Cryopsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Woodtick loamy fine sand, in rangeland on a 5 percent slope at 2,036 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

       A -- 0 to 17 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary. (9 to 28 cm thick)

       BC -- 17 to 55 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary. (16 to 68 cm thick)

       C -- 55 to 159 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  
KUNAYOSH (AK) - have a udic moisture regime
LUKANIN (AK) - have an O horizon
MYSTEN (CO) - have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments within the control section 
SKAGWAY (AK) - have a seasonally high water table within 150 cm
TEKLANIKA (AK) - have an O horizon
WITEFELS (NV,CA) - are moderately deep to paralithic contact

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - dunes 
Elevation - 2,025 to 2,155 meters
Slope - 1 to 45 percent 
Parent materials - eolian sands and alluvium 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; cool summers 
Mean annual precipitation - 355 to 430 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 4 degrees C 
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are typically native range and used for grazing cattle and for wildlife habitat. Vegetation is chiefly sagebrush and native grass such as needle-and-thread and Indian ricegrass, and brittle pricklypear cactus and pricklyphlox. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Woodtick series is of small extent in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA - 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Red Rock Lakes Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2012; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2010.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 17 cm (A horizon); and a 
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (parts of the BC and C horizons).

Woodtick soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
