WABUN SERIES

The Wabun series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils on lake plains. These soils formed in sandy outwash and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Mollic Psammaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Wabun mucky sand, on a 1 percent slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

 A--0 to 15 cm (6 inches); black (10YR 2/1) mucky sand, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Cg1--15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Cg2--25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand; single grain; loose; many fine and medium roots; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common medium faint gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Cg3--76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand; single grain; loose; many medium and coarse prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Cg4--122 to 147 cm (48 to 58 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stratified sand and fine sand; single grain; loose; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 2Cg--147 to 203 cm (58 to 80 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay; massive; firm; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Iosco County, Michigan; about 2 miles southeast of the town of McIvor; 2200 feet north and 700 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 13, T. 21 N., R. 6 E.; USGS National City topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 12 minutes 43 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 38 minutes 43 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the upper sandy layers: 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches)
Base saturation in the sandy layers: 50 to 75 percent
Rock fragment content: 0 to 3 percent gravel throughout the profile

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 0 or 1
Texture: mucky sand or sand
Reaction: moderately acid

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 7
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: sand, fine sand, or is stratified with these textures
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

Ab horizon, where present:
Hue: 10YR or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 0 or 1
Texture: muck (sapric material) or mucky sand
Reaction: moderately acid

2C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: clay or silty clay
Reaction: moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cormant, Deinache, Roscommon, and Wheatley series. Cormant, Deinache, Roscommon, and Wheatley soils do not have textures containing more than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wabun soils are on flats or in depressions on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Wabun soils formed in sandy outwash and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kanotin, Mcivor, Pullup, and Proper soils. The somewhat poorly drained Mcivor soils are on higher flats. The somewhat excessively drained Pullup soils and the moderately well drained Proper are on old beach ridges. The very poorly drained Kanotin soils are in some depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy outwash and moderately low in the lacustrine deposits. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy outwash and slow in the lacustrine deposit.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in woodland or in brush. Native vegetation is black ash, quaking aspen or cottonwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
