     C3--55 to 75 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) fine sand with thin strata of coarse sand; single grained; loose; few medium weakly cemented light red (2.5YR 6/6) concretions; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     C4--75 to 99 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) fine sand; single grained; loose; strongly acid.  (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 60 to 100 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION: Brunswick County, North Carolina, on Bowen Point; 0.3 mile west of the intersection of State Road 1137 and 1138, 50 feet north of State Road 1138.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Horizon Thickness: Thickness of the sandy horizons is more than 72 inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 60 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 48 to 72 inches, January to March
Soil Reaction: strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and very strongly acid to neutral in the C horizons.  The particle-size control section contains 5 to 20 percent silt plus clay 

A horizon:
Color--has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where value is less than 3 it is less than 6 inches thick.
Texture--loamy fine sand or fine sand

E horizon (if they occur):
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4
Texture--loamy fine sand or sand

Bw horizon (if they occur):
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7,and chroma of 4 to 8
Texture--loamy fine sand or fine sand

C horizon: 
Color(upper part)--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8
Color(lower part)--hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 3 to 8
Texture--loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand
Redoximorphic Features (if they occur)--iron masses and concretions in shades of yellow, brown, or red and iron depletions in shades of gray, olive, and brown.  Depletions occur 40 to 60 inches below surface

COMPETING SERIES:
Alaga soils--have a minimum of 10 percent silt plus clay in the control section and do not allow 5YR values in the profile.

Darden soils--soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 cumulative days in most years 
Foxworth soils-- have 5 to 10 percent silt plus clay in the control section
Glentosh soils--soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for no more than 90 cumulative days 
Lakeland soils--have 5 to 10 percent silt plus clay in the control section
McNeely soils--are excessively drained 
Tonkawa soils-are dry in some part of the moisture control section for 125 to 150 cumulative days in most years
Turkey soils--are somewhat excessively drained

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Charleston County, South Carolina; 1971.

REMARKS: Laboratory data indicate that Wando soils contain more available phosphorus and calcium than somewhat similar soils on higher marine terraces.

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon).
