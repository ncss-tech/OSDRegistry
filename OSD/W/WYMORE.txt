WYMORE SERIES

The Wymore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess. These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

5/00 added from the Soil Interpretation Record clay content and sand content to 
"Range in Characteristics" and Frost Free period to "Geographic Setting". Added words, slightly alkaline, to reaction class of C horizon based on NSSL data. 
Modified format by LRM in 2/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

09/2008 GJJ converted Celsius to Fahrenheit and made some format changes.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The Wymore pedon described in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 5, pg. 232 and 233, is the same as the typical pedon described here. Other pedons are on pg. 226 to 231 or at this site:

Wymore was modified 12/12/2003 to remove slopes greater than 9 percent and to clarify depths to pedisediment and glacial till.
