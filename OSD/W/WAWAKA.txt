WAWAKA SERIES

The Wawaka series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess and in the underlying till over outwash. The Wawaka soils are on outwash floored till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wawaka soils are on outwash floored till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in 1.5 to 3.0 meters (5 to 10 feet) of till and in the underlying outwash that can be capped with up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (48 to 55 degrees F).Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 213 to 335 meters (700 to 1,100 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belmore, Crosby, and Miami soils. The Belmore soils are in slight depressions on similar landforms. The somewhat poorly drained Crosby soils are on swells on till plains. The moderately well drained Miami soils are on swells and knolls on till plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the upper parts of the series control section; moderately high in the lower parts; and high or very high in the underlying outwash. Permeability is moderate in the upper parts of the series control section and moderately slow in the lower part (permeability is slow between structural units in the 2C/Bt horizons). Permeability is rapid or very rapid in the underlying outwash.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. Some areas are used for growing small grain, mainly wheat, and for hay and pasture. Also a few areas are in woodland or urban land. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Indiana; MLRAs 111A and 111D. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Delaware County, Indiana, 1997.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 89 cm (2Bt horizon).

The Wawaka series had been inactive and was reactivated in 1997. The original Wawaka series concept fits the Miami, gravelly substratum phase as correlated in several subsets of soil surveys.

Representative data mapunits are as follows: DMU ID 123784 for the nearly level phase; DMU ID 123785 for the gently sloping phase; and DMU ID 123786 for the moderately sloping phase.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data for this pedon, S92IN-035-006, is from the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.
