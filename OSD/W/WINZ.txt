WINZ SERIES

The Winz series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from rhyodacitic tuff and other volcanic rocks. Winz soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy Vitrandic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Winz gravelly ashy loam--forestland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered by 20 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 12 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and many fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine and medium interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    EBt--35 to  75 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common 3 to 5 cm pockets of clay accumulation with many distinct and few faint light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay films on rock fragments; many very fine, common fine, and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and common fine and medium tubular pores; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble, 5 percent stone; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual irregular boundary. (35 to 55 cm thick)

    Bt--75 to 150 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, many medium, and common coarse roots; many coarse tubular pores; many distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay films on rock fragments; 45 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble, 2 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2)

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; about .5 miles east of Mount Wilson summit; Sec 32, T 5N, R 68E; USGS Schoolmarm Basin 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; Latitude 38 degrees 15 minutes 5.5 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 23 minutes 8.5 seconds W; UTM zone 11 728762e, 4236956n; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter, spring, and early summer, dry in all parts at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice (July and August), but intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September; Effective precipitation is increased due to prolonged snowpack. Typic xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 4 to 7 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent; 
Rock fragments: 50 to 75 percent, dominated by 2 to 5 mm size gravel. Lithology of fragments is welded tuff.

Value:  4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Mineralogy: 25 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the 0.2 to 2.0 mm fraction and averages 0.1 to 0.2 percent Al plus 1/2Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate.

E horizon

Mineralogy: 20 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction and averages 0.1 to 0.3 percent Al plus 1/2Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Eastridge series. Eastridge soils contain 35 to 65 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section that averages greater than 5 mm in size.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winz soils are on mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions on north aspects. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from rhyodacitic tuff and other volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,330 to 2,750 meters. The climate is moist subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Antennapeak, Nevtah, Wiltop, and Winu soils.  Antennapeak soils have summer soil temperatures of 8 to 10 degrees C. Nevtah soils have 30 to 50 percent rock fragments in the control section. Wiltop soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section. Winu soils are coarse-loamy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have a mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Winz soils are used for forestland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, Rocky Mountain white fir, snowberry, and associated grasses and forbs. Some sites have scattered ponderosa pine. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY080NV, ABCOC-PSMEG WSG.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A. Winz has 5717 acres correlated in CO675 in MLRA 36 and the concept should be reviewed during updates.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A horizon and the upper part of the E horizon).
Albic horizon - The zone from 12 to 75 cm (E and EBt horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 75 to 150 cm (Bt horizon).
Vitrandic feature - 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass in the 0.2 to 2 mm fraction between 0 to 75 cm (A, E, and EBt horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 75 to 125 cm (upper part of the Bt horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Winz soils were formerly classified as Xeric Haplocryalfs. The type location was changed and classification updated (12/2008) to recognize parent material characteristics. Additional author's initials are LNL/ELS.
