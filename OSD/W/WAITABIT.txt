COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deception, Homestead, and Remedios series. Deception, Homestead, and Remedios series have a presumed mean annual soil temperature greater than 36 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly till
Elevation: 2,671 to 3,438 feet (814 to 1,048 m)
Slope: 22 to 60 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 35 inches (712 to 894 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Ogive and Phalarope soils. Ogive soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on mountains. Phalarope soils are well drained, very deep and occur on outwash plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is white spruce/green alder forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
