WODA SERIES

The Woda series consists of shallow and very shallow over a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and reworked lacustrine deposits.  The Woda soils are on isolated fan remnants and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, carbonatic, thermic, shallow Calcic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Woda sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with 60 percent pebbles consisting mainly of pan fragments.

    A1--0 to 1 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots, common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 10 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4) clear wavy boundary (1 to 2 inches thick)

     A2--1 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic, common very fine, fine and medium roots, common very fine and fine interstitial pores, 5 percent pebbles, strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk--10 to 18 inches; white (10YR 8/1) gravelly clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; 20 percent pebbles; common soft lime filaments throughout horizon; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0) abrupt, smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

   Bkm--18 to 60 inches, white (10YR 8/1) indurated petrocalcic horizon.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; approximately 7 miles southwest of Lathrop Wells, and about 1,600 feet north and 500 feet west of the southeast corner of section 25, T. 16 S., R. 50 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Moist for short periods during winter and spring months; Typic Aridic moisture regime. The ratio of soil moisture utalized for evapotranspiration between summer and winter is about 0.4:1, typical of the Mojave Desert.

Soil temperature - 62 to 67 degrees F.

Depth to petrocalcic horizon - 7 to 20 inches.

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 40 to 60 percent

Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently
effervescent.

Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Other features - In some areas a thin mantle of wind blown sand cover the soil surface.


Control section Percent clay: 20 to 30 percent.

Rock fragments: 15 to 30 percent, mainly pebbles.


A horizon- Value: 7 or 8 dry.

Chroma: 2 or 3 dry.


Bk horizon - Value: 5 through 7 moist.

Chroma: 3 or 4 moist.

Clay content: 20 to 30 percent.

Texture: Loam or clay loam

Rock fragments: 15 to 30 percent.

Carbonates: 5 to 20 percent identifiable secondary carbonates as filaments, masses and coatings.


Bkm horizon - 4 to 15 feet thick.

Rupture resistance: very strongly cemented or indurated.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bard (NV), Crossen (Tx), Mormon Mesa (NV), and Upton (Tx) series.  Bard and Mormon Mesa soils lack horizons with more than 18 percent clay.  Crossen soils have an ustic-aridic soil moisture regime and 3 to 10 inch thick petrocalcic horizon. Upton soils receive more summer moisture and have a 4 to 36 inch thick petrocalcic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Woda soils are on isolated mesa-like fan remnants and fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in alluvium primarily from limestone.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 2,400 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is arid with cool winters and hot summers, typical of the Mojave Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is between 3 and 6 inches; mean annual temperature between 60 to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gosa and Canutio soils which lack a hardpan in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow or medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly desertholly.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 30.
