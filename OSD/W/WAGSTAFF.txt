WAGSTAFF SERIES

The Wagstaff series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  They are on nearly level to gently sloping summits, shoulders and side slopes on interfluves on plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112). Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (57 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 1092 mm (43 inches).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 inches). Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 inches).  Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 46 cm (4 to 18 inches), and the argillic horizon thickness ranges from 20 to 80 cm (8 to 32 inches).  Depth to redoximorphic concentrations ranges from 54 to 100 cm (21 to 40 inches).  Depth to episaturation: 70 to 100 cm (30 to 40 in.) intermittently from November through May.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 13 to 17 degrees C (56 to 62 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are Aliceville in the same family.  Aliceville soils are 100 to 150 cm deep over limestone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wagstaff soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits, shoulder and side slopes on interfluves on plains in the Cherokee Prairies.  The slopes are usually linear to convex.  Slope gradients range from about 0 to 8 percent. Wagstaff soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying residuum from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 880 to 1095 mm (35 to 43 inches) and is distributed throughout the year with May through July receiving the most precipitation usually during intense thunderstorms.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13 to 16 degrees C (55 to 62 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Aliceville, Bucyrus, Eram, Shidler, and Summit series. Bucyrus soils are greater than 150 cm to bedrock. Aliceville soils are greater than 100 to 150 cm to bedrock. Eram soils are on backslopes and are 50 to 100 cm deep to shale. Summit are more than 100 cm to shale. Shidler soils are less than 50 cm deep to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately low in the lower part.  A layer of episaturation occurs intermittently during periods of high rainfall in most years at depths greater than 70 cm, duration is long enough to create redoximorphic concentrations but not of sufficient duration to create redoximorphic depletions.

USE AND VEGETATION: Corn, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat are the principal crops. Some areas are used for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 112 in southeast Kansas, southwest Missouri and northeast Oklahoma.  This series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Miami County, Kansas, 1994. 

REMARKS: Formerly these soils were mapped as Catoosa and Oska series.
WAW 8/2009 The classification and type location for Wagstaff are being revised as part of an update project in MLRA 112.  The original type location was established as a result of a small project in the northern extreme of MLRA 112 and this location is more central to MLRA 112.  The original concept was slightly better drained with smectitic mineralogy.  Further investigation and data throughout the MLRA suggests this new classification is the most prevalent.  The mean annual soil temperature at the type location and in the northern range of the series is slightly less than the 15 degree C break for thermic soils.  The MLRA 112 boundary crosses the mesic thermic areas and for classification MLRA 112 soils are considered thermic.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 54 cm (0 to 21 in.)
Argillic horizon: 39 to 93 cm (15 to 37 in.)
Redox concentrations: 54 to 93 cm (21 to 37 in.)
Slickensides: 54 to 93 cm (21 to 37 in.)
Linear extensibility greater than 6.0 cm within 100 cm.
Lithic contact: 93 cm (37 in.)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Typical NSSL laboratory sample pedon 86P0874 (pedon 86KS001007) is from the type location.  Other lab samples that support this series are: National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska - 05N0817, 86P0871, 08N0034, 96P0385 and Missouri Characterization Laboratory Number M0501304.
