WILHELM SERIES

The Wilhelm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan remnants and outwash terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.3 degrees C.
