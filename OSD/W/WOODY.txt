WOODY SERIES

The Woody series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from igneous rock.  Woody soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Woody gravelly loam, on a east facing, concave, 11 percent slope in Wyoming big sagebrush rangeland at an elevation of 2,310 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by 30 percent fine gravel, 20 percent medium and coarse gravel, and 10 percent cobbles.
