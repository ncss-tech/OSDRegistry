WINU SERIES

The Winu series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks. Winu soils are on lower mountain side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Winu gravely loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial and fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt1--20 to 41 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores, many fine and very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on ped faces; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--41 to 56 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, common fine and very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores,  many fine and very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt3--56 to 81 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate coarse and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; few faint pressure faces on peds; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    R--81 cm; andesite

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; USGS Cooper Peak, 7.5 minute quadrangle; about 7 miles southeast of Tonkin; approximately 2300 feet north and 2340 feet west of the southeast corner of section 1, T. 23 N., R. 50 E; latitude 39 degrees 53 minutes 19.21 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 17 minutes 51.5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.8886694 latitude, -116.2976389 longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bachus, Bavdark, Benteen, Brushtop, Clayburn, Croydon, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Echemoor, Hagenbarth, Hoopgobel, Lostminer, Millerlake, Odark, Pontuge, Senchert, Southmount, Poodle, Stubbs, Thulepah, and Vadnais series.  

Bachus and Vadnais soils average summer soil temperatures of 7 to 11 degrees C and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. Bavdark, Dranburn, Odark, and Pontuge soils are very deep. Benteen soils have slightly alkaline layers in the lower profile. Brushtop soils are deep. Echemoor, Hoopgobel, and Stubbs soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Croydon soils have a paralithic contact at 100 to 150 cm. Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Dehana, Demast, Dranyon, Hagenbarth, Millerlake and Thulepah have bedrock at a depth of more than 100 cm. Lostminer soils have a Bk horizon below the Bt horizons. Senchert and Poodle soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. Southmont soils are deep and very deep, average 24 to 32 percent clay and less than 20 percent rock fragments in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winu soils are on lower mountain side slopes. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from mixed igneous rocks. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2200 to 2900 meters. The climate is cold, continental with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season is 45 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mosquet, Labshaft, Decram, and Spinlin series. Mosquet and Labshaft are 25 to 50 cm to a lithic contact. Decram soils are not Pachic and lack an argillic horizon. Spinlin soils are average 40-60 percent clay in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is principally mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada and southern Idaho. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 10, 25, 28B, 28A. Presently there are 29,672 acres in MLRA 28A where the series is established. About 3734 acres are in MLRA 25; 13,497 acres are in MLRA 10; and 12,211 acres are in MLRA 28B.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 56 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 81 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).

Particle-size control section - 20 to 70 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).

Additional data: The series type location was moved to the Soil Survey of Eureka County Area, Nevada in March 2010 to better reflect the series concept.
