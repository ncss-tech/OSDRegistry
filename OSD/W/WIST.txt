SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2003 

REMARKS: Wist soils were previously included with Collington soils. They are similar to Collington, but have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 102 to 183 cm (40 to 72 inches). Sulfidic materials are commonly found at some depth below the series control section. 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 43 cm (Ap1, Ap2, and BE horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 43 to 104 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon)
Aquic Conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 104 to 208 cm at some time during the year 
Other soil features identified in this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm
