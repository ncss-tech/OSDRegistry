FIG SERIES

The Fig series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from granite and gneiss.  Fig soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 30 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic, shallow Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Fig extremely stony sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely stony sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 20 percent stones, 20 percent cobble, 1 percent boulders; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 or 2 inches thick)

    C--2 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 17 inches thick)

    2Cr--9 to 60 inches; weathered granite.

TYPE LOCATION: Mohave County, Arizona; 5 miles northwest of Kingman; about 1,900 feet north and 1,100 feet east of the southwest corner of section 8, T. 22 N., R. 17 W. Gila and Salt River Base Meridian. 35 degrees, 18 minutes, 25 seconds north latitude, 114 degrees, 07 minutes, 30 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December  February and for less than 20 days cumulative July - September.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 61 to 66 degrees F.

Depth to a paralithic contact: 4 to 20 inches

Rock fragments: averages 35 to 65 percent gravel

Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline

Clay content: 5 to 18 percent


A and C horizons

Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR

Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Nolena and Wikieup series. Nolena and Wikeup soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fig soils are on hills and mountains at elevations of 3,800 to 5,800 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from granite and gneiss.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blind soils.  Blind soils are very deep.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is flattop buckwheat, black grama, sideoats grama, big galleta and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona. MLRA is 30. This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Mohave County, Arizona; Soil survey of Mohave County, Arizona, Central Part; 2005.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)

Entisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons

Paralithic contact - The boundary at 9 inches (2Cr horizon)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003.
