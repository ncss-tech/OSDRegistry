GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fiesta soils are on footslopes of valley sides. They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist. Slopes are 10 to 35 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 40 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Enmedio, Espanola, Morenda, and Posada soils. Enmedio soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental and occur on backslopes of hills. Espanola soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons or argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent risers of high stream terraces. Morenda soils are coarse-loamy, have water tables within 5 feet, and occur on low stream terraces of valley floors. Posada soils are coarse-loamy, lack argillic horizons, and occur on inset fans of valley sides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Fiesta soils are used for timber production, urban development, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is Arizona fescue, Gamble's oak, elk sedge, muttongrass, ponderosa pine.  The ecological site is Pinus ponderosa-Juniperus scopulorum/Quercus gambleii-Cercocarpus montanus/Poa fendleriana-Muhlenbergia montana(F070XA022NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Fiesta soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 48A.
