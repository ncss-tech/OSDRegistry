FORGOTTEN SERIES

The Forgotten series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and till derived from granitic rocks. The Forgotten soils are on high gradient drainageways on mountain slopes, moraines, and glacial valley walls of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.

TYPE LOCATION: Fresno County, California, below Taboose Pass in Kings Canyon National Park; USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle: Mount Pinchot, California; WGS84 36.977634 latitude and -118.422499 longitude;  UTM zone 11 4093336 meters N 373392 meters E NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm is 0 to 6 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is more than 6 degrees C. The soils have a cryic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about September to October (about 60 days). The soils contain a seasonal water table as high as 50 cm during the winter, spring and early summer months, falling to below 100 cm during late summer and fall.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Forgotten soils are on linear to concave positions; they form in channels and floodplain steps of high-gradient drainageways on basin floors, cirques, talus slopes, mountain slopes, plateaus, glacial-valley walls, and moraines. Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent. These soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and till derived from granite, granodiorite. Elevation is 2275 to 4410 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 520 to 1505 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -2 to 5 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Evolution soils. The Evolution soils are on concave positions on moraines and glacial valley floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Occasional to frequent flooding for very brief (4 to 48 hours) duration in April through June, no ponding. Seasonal high water table between 50 to 100 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is Sierra willow, shootingstar, shorthair reedgrass, purple mountainheath, dwarf bilberry, and carex species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
