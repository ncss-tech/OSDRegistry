FLAGSPRING SERIES

The Flagspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands. They formed in colluvium from cherty limestone over residuum from limestone and tripoli on ridge tops. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Boden, Braddock, Buffstat, (T) Casville, Christian, Clifton, Clover, (T) Danripple, Groseclose, Howell, (T) Mount Rush, Muse, Rapidan, Sequola, (T) Spears Mountain, Totier, Unison, and (T) Yellowbottom series. Boden soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Braddock, Casville, Clifton, and Clover soils typically have mica flakes in the profile. Buffstat and Totier soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Christian soils are formed in residuum of interbedded limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale and do not have parafragments. Danripple, Groseclose, Howell, and Yellowbottom soils have a solum less than 60 inches in depth.  Mount Rush, Muse, Sequola, and Spears Mountian soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Rapidan soils formed from greenstone conglomerate rock and do not have parafragments.  Unison soils formed in crystalline rocks and do not have parafragments. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flagspring soils are on ridge tops on the Springfield Plain (MLRA 116B). Slopes are convex and range from 3 to 15 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from cherty limestone over residuum from limestone and tripoli of the Burlington/Keokuk formation (Mississippian age). The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 60 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clarksville, Noark, Rueter, Goss, Hailey and Jollymill soils. These soils have skeletal particle size classes. Clarksville and Noark soils are on lower ridge tops. Rueter, Goss, Hailey and Jollymill soils are on sideslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Some of these areas are cleared and used for pasture and hay. The other areas are woodland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods and pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Springfield Plain region (MLRA 116B) of southwest Missouri. This series is of small extent, about 4,300 acres have been mapped to date.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: McDonald County, Missouri, 2004. The name is from the state forest where the typical pedon is located.

REMARKS: Soil temperature data collected from this site for over 5 years indicates that the temperature regime overlaps mesic and thermic. The series was classified as mesic in order to match the adjacent series in mapping.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (A and E horizons).
2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 80 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 3B/C1, and 3B/C2 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon ID number 95MO119010. University of Missouri Soil Characterization Laboratory sample number M9511910.
