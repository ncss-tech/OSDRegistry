FENNER SERIES

The Fenner series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly alluvium from volcanic and metamorphic sources. The Fenner soils are on fan aprons. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, hyperthermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Fenner fine sand, on a south facing, convex, 1 percent slope under rangeland at an elevation of 607 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. 3/11/2014) The soil surface is covered by approximately 15 percent fine gravel, 30 percent medium and coarse gravel. 

     A--0 to 4 cm (0 to 2 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 3 percent fine gravel and 2 percent medium and coarse gravel; slightly alkaline, pH 7.6; abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 7 cm, 1 to 3 inches thick)

     Bw--4 to 18 cm (2 to 7 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate very coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 2 percent fine gravel and 2 percent medium and coarse gravel; slightly alkaline, pH 7.6; clear wavy boundary. (12 to 20 cm, 5 to 8 inches thick)

     C--18 to 67 cm (7 to 26 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 3 percent fine gravel and 2 percent medium and coarse gravel; slightly alkaline, pH 7.8; clear wavy boundary. 

     Ck1--67 to 86 cm (26 to 34 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent fine gravel and 6 percent medium and coarse gravel; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0; clear smooth boundary. 

     Ck2--86 to 135 cm (34 to 53 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 15 percent fine gravel, 20 percent medium and coarse gravel and 3 percent cobbles; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2. (The combined thickness of the C horizons is 125 to 150 cm, 49 to 59 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION: San Bernardino County, California; approximately 3 miles west of Fenner and 10 feet east and 120 feet north of the southwest corner of section 32, T. 9 N., R. 17 E., San Bernardino Meridian; USGS Colton Well, California 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 34 degrees, 49 minutes, 6.06 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees, 13 minutes, 54.45 seconds west longitude; 661717e, 3854324n (DTM: NAD83). 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some parts for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September following summer convection storms; typic aridic moisture regime. 

Soil temperature: 22 to 25 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 32 to 35 degrees C.
Mean winter soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Surface rock fragments: 15 to 60 percent, dominated by gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Bristolake, Goldrose, Sheephole, and Whiterobe series. Bristolake soils have sodium adsorption ratio of 5 to 12 and electrical conductivity of 4 to 16 dS/m in the lower profile. Goldrose soils have a MAST of 25 to 28 degrees C. Sheephole soils have eolian sands over alluvium. Whiterobe soils have a paralithic contact at 50 to 100 cm and formed in colluvium and residuum. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Fenner soils are on fan aprons. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in sandy and gravelly alluvium from volcanic and metamorphic sources. Elevation ranges from 590 to 900 meters (1,930 to 2,950 feet). The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm (4 to 6 inches). The mean annual air temperature is about 19 to 22 degrees C. The frost free period is 330 to 365 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Pintobasin and Rubylee soils. Pintobasin soils are located on adjacent fan aprons and do not have sandy loam textures or greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Rubylee soils are located on adjacent fan remnants and have 10 to 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low runoff; rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Fenner soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat and rangeland. The present vegetation is mainly white bursage and creosotebush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California; MLRA 30. These soils are of moderate extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.
