FOXVIRE SERIES

The Foxvire series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Foxvire soils are on concave mountain side slopes (snow pockets).  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Foxvire gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    A2--13 to 33 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 38 cm thick)

    Bw--33 to 41 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 25 cm thick)

    C--41 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; about 600 feet south and 1,200 feet east of the northwest corner of section 13, T. 2 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Stone Cabin Ranch SE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 56 minutes 57 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 30 minutes 51 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.9492778 latitude, -116.5141667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist, moist in winter and early spring, dry summer and fall, but moist intermittently due to convection storms; dry in all parts at least 45 consecutive days following summer solstice, dry 90 to 100 days cumulative, xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 40 to 64 cm.
Depth to bedrock: Greater than 150 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  8 to 15 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 3.

Bw horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

C horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Sandy loam or loam.
Clay content:  8 to 15 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aycab, Brownsgulch, Cinderspring, Coffepot, Coutis, Earcree, Gardners Fork, Grayhead, Hailman, Moonlight, Naz, Razorba, Shook, Skyway, Taral and Tosp series. 

Aycab soils have a paralithic contact at 60 to 100 cm. Brownsgulch, Cinderspring Gardners Fork, Razorba, and Taral soils have soil temperatures less than 6 degrees C. Coffepot, Grayhead, Shook and Skyway soils have bedrock within 100 cm. Coutis soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Earcree, Hailman, Moonlight and Tosp soils have mollic epipedons more than 64 cm thick. Naz soils lack cambic horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Foxvire soils are on mountain summits and side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rock.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 2,445 to 3,055 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 450 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Packer and Suak soils.  Packer soils have an argillic horizon and a mollic horizon 18 to 25 cm thick. Suak soils have bedrock 50 to 100 cm deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, lupine, pine bluegrass, Letterman needlegrass, thickspike wheatgrass, western wheatgrass and sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada. MLRA 29. These soils are not extensive.
