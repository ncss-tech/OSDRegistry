Keys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth edition, 2014 
Updated the OSD to reflect MLRA 79 climate - changed taxonomy to mesic. 
Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

GLP 07/2009 revised competing series, updated range in characteristics. 

1/2017 BKN Updated lat/long to WGS84. Added precipitation pattern to geographic settings. Removed Carway and Taver from geographically associated soils. Added secondary carbonates to remarks. Updated Keys to Soil Taxonomy to twelfth edition. 
ADDITIONAL DATA: For additional information, refer to Soil Survey Investigation Report No.4, pages 22 to 25. The type location was moved in 1999 with the correlation of the Reno County, Kansas update. NSSL lab pedon number 40A1785 (pedon ID S1958KS155005) is from near the original type location. Other samples that support this series are: NSSL lab sample number 97P0098 (pedon ID 96KS155415), 40A1786 (pedon ID S1958KS155009), and 06N1020 (pedon ID S2006KS185903).
