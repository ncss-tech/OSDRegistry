FORDCREEK SERIES 

The Fordcreek series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess and alluvium over material from granitic or metamorphic rock. Fordcreek soils are on 5 to 75 percent slopes on canyon sides and benches.  They have moderately slow permeability. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beal, Boardburn, Boomer, Casabonne, Cherryhill, Cle Elum, Cohasset, Crozier, Dalig(T), Fives, Gunn(T), Holland, Hood, Hotaw, Latourell, Lettia, Norling, Para(T), Rosehaven, Sanhedrin, Tigit(T), Ulhalf, Varelum, and Wohly series. Beal, Boardburn, Boomer, Casabonne, Cherryhill, Cle Elum, Crozier, Dalig, Fives, Gunn, Hood, Hotaw, Latourell, Norling, Para, Rosehaven, Sanhedrin, Tigit, Ulhalf, Varelum and Wohly soils are not deep to granitic paralithic contact. Cohasset soils have average annual soil temperatures of 54 to 59 degrees F. Holland soils have average annual soil temperatures of 52 to 59 degrees F. Lettia soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fordcreek soils are on canyon sides, benches and terraces at elevations of 1,000 to 3,000 feet and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. These soils have developed in loess and alluvium over material weathered from granite or metamorphic rock.  The average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 30 inches and the frost free season is 90 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahsahka, Texascreek, and Whiskeycreek soils. The Ahsahka soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic.  They are found on canyon sides and benches. The Texascreek soils have coarse sandy loam textures in the substratum and are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  They are found on steep canyon sides. Whiskeycreek soils are less than 20 inches to a lithic contact.  They are found on steep canyon sides. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is moderate to very rapid; permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for range, wildlife habitat, homesite development and some woodland production. The natural vegetation is ponderosa pine, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, rose, and bromegrass.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Clearwater County, Idaho; the series is not extensive.
