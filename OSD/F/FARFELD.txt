FARFELD SERIES

The Farfeld series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very slow in the lower part.  These soils are on upland plains and plateaus on drainage divides.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

Slope - 0 to 6 percent.

Parent material: alluvium.

Climate: cool, with long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 16 inches.

Mean annual air temperature: 40 to 45 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amor, Cedarpan, Dogtooth, Farnuf, Janesburg, Regent and Wyola.  Amor soils are on side slopes.  They have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cedarpan, Dogtooth and Janesburg soils are intermixed with the Farfeld soils.  They have natric horizons.  Farnuf, Regent and Wyola soils are on fans.  They have argillic horizons and have soft bedrock below a depth of 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very slow in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Farfeld soils are used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is blue grama, thickspike wheatgrass and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Farfeld soils are of small extent in southwestern North Dakota.
