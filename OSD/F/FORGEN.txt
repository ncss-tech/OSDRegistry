FORGEN SERIES

The Forgen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm, and annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Forgen peaty silt loam, in pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

       A--0 to 6 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) peaty silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many irregular pores; very slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 8 cm thick)                                                                                        

       Btn1--6 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many irregular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds and surfaces along root channels; very slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary.  

       Btn2--28 to 61 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; 10 percent, medium, faint, irregular, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, redoximorphic feature; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; many irregular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; very slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Btn1, Btn2 -- 30 to 65 cm)                                   

       C1--61 to 99 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; 10 percent, fine, prominent, irregular, 7.5YR (4/6) moist, masses of oxidized iron in matrix; massive; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine roots; common interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. 

       C2--99 to 119 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; 10 percent fine distinct irregular 7.5YR (4/6), moist, masses of oxidized iron in matrix; massive; moderately hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; common interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  

       C3--119 to 150 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; 30 percent, coarse, prominent, irregular, 7.5YR (4/6) moist, masses of oxidized iron in matrix; massive; moderately hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; few interstitial pores; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
