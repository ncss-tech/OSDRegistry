FETTIC SERIES

The Fettic series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Fettic soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Natrixerolls

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fettic soils are on low stream terraces.  The terraces are dissected by many deep drainage channels and sloughs.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,560 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dangberg, Godecke, and Ormsby soils.  Dangberg soils are fine, moderately deep to duripans, and have ochric epipedons.  Godecke soils are fine-loamy and have ochric epipedons.  Ormsby soils are sandy, do not have natric horizons, and have ochric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; very high surface runoff; very slow permeability in the subsoil and moderately rapid to rapid permeability in the substratum; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 104 and 152 cm (deep free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and March.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Fettic soils are used mainly for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is inland saltgrass, black greasewood, basin big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, alkali sacaton, beardless wildrye, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.

REMARKS:  The 4/2000 revision updated the taxonomic subgroup from Aquic Natrargids to Aridic Natrixerolls.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A and Btn horizons).
Natric horizon - The zone from 10 to 51 cm (Btn and Btk horizons).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 104 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (part of the C1 and C2 horizons).
Particle size control section - The zone from 10 to 30 cm (Btn horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The type location was moved to Washoe County, NV to better reflect the series concept.
