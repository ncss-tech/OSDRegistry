FENTON SERIES

The Fenton series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 309 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Fenton gravely sandy clay loam, 3 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 1,513 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Ap--0 to 18 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) gravely sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 44 cm thick)

   Btk--18 to 45 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravely sandy clay loam; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout, few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; finely disseminated carbonates and 2 percent fine moist irregular calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; 5 percent fine 10YR 3/1 manganese masses, 8 percent fine 7.5YR 6/4 oxidized iron masses; 5 percent fine 10YR 7/2 iron depletions; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 60 cm thick)

   BCk--45 to 200 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravely sandy loam; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; finely disseminated carbonates and 30 percent prominent carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; 3 percent fine 7.5YR 6/4 oxidized iron masses, 8 percent fine 10YR 7/1 iron depletions; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Park County, Wyoming; 563 meters south and 639 meters west of the northeast corner of section 29, T. 51 N., R. 98W.; Sheets Flat USGS quadrangle; latitude 44 degrees 21 minutes 58.82 seconds N. and longitude 108 degrees 39 minutes 44.74 seconds W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature - 8 to 10 degrees C
Depth to seasonal high water table - 90 to 180 cm
Rock fragments - 15 to 30 percent gravel in the particle-size control section; 15 to 60 percent in the lower part of the subsoil 

Note: where cultivated, saturation is, in part, from intensive flood irrigation.
