FOY SERIES

The Foy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a mantle of alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt and sedimentary rocks underlain by alluvium and/or weathered residuum from sedimentary bedrock.  Foy soils are on structural benches and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

The surface is covered by 1 percent boulders, 10 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel of basalt origin and 2 percent sedimentary channers.

Barkelew soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Bronec and Yampa soils are less than 20 cm to the calcic horizon and do not have cambic horizons. 
Devilsthumb and Tabyago soils are moderately deep to bedrock. 
Wildmount soils do not have the surface mantle of basalt alluvium or colluvium.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  a basalt mantle of alluvium and colluvium over alluvium, colluvium and residuum from sedimentary rocks.
Landform:  alluvial fans, structural benches and mountain slopes.
