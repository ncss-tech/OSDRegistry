FIVERIVERS SERIES

The Fiverivers series of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone.

The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Benton County, Oregon, 2004. The name is taken from Five Rivers, a stream in the Coast Range flowing through Lane and Lincoln counties in Oregon. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (A, AB horizons).
Cambic horizon - from depths of 9 to 36 inches (Bw, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Particle-size control section - from 11 to 36 inches (4 inches of the Bw horizon, and all of Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 
Andic feature - from the mineral soil surface to 9 inches (A, AB horizons). Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties. 
Evidence of translocated clay - few faint clay films are present in this soil; however the clay increase is not significant enough to qualify as an argillic horizon. 
Depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon. 
Classification revision 9/03 from fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Typic Dystrudepts to fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Andic Dystrudepts based on lab data and associated soils.
