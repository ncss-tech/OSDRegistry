FILLMORE SERIES

The Fillmore series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess.  Fillmore soils are in closed depressions on loess uplands and loess-covered stream terraces on river valleys in the Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 680 millimeters (27 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Argialbolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fillmore silt loam, on a concave, less than 1 percent slope in native rangeland at an elevation of 541 meters (1775 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (18 to 43 centimeters) 7 to 17 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Clay County, Nebraska; about 3 kilometers (2 miles) south of Clay Center; located about 729 meters (2390 feet) west and 84 meters (275 feet) north of the southeast corner, sec. 12, T. 6 N., R. 7 W.; Fairfield USGS quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 29 minutes 47.4 seconds N. and longitude 98 degrees 3 minutes 36.0 seconds W., NAD83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: Saturated to the surface November to March. April through July intermittently dry in surface layer, but near saturation in lower soil horizons. Driest in August through October.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F)
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to over 150 centimeters (20 to 60 inches)
Depth to argillic horizon: 15 to 60 centimeters (6 to 24 inches)
Depth to secondary carbonates: 75 centimeters (30 inches) to more than 150 centimeters (60 inches)
Depth to redoximorphic features: Indicators are generally present in the albic and argillic horizons of the soil. Often indicators may be masked by the very dark color of the organic matter.  Common, fine, distinct (10YR 4/4) oxidized zones exist around root channels in the upper Bt horizon. Few to common, fine to coarse, black (10YR 2/1) round (shot-like), hard, iron/manganese concretions or nodules, will also be present in the Bt horizon.  Grayish depletions within the matrix of peds do occur and are sometimes visible in the lower B horizon directly below the dark organic colors.
Depth to episaturation: 15 centimeters (6 inches) above the surface to about 61 centimeters (24 inches) below the surface.

Particle-size control section (weighted average):

When there are secondary carbonates present, the BC and C horizons are now being called Bk horizons to indicate soil development. Bk horizons would have the same properties as described in the Range in Characteristics for the BC and C horizons.   

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Barbert, Crestmeade, Edina, Filbert, Massie, Scott, Sturges and Triplett soils.  
Barbert and Massie soils are very poorly drained.  
Crestmeade soils have temperatures greater than 54 degrees F in the soil temperature control section.  
Triplett soils have more than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the particle size control section.  
Edina soils are poorly or very poorly drained.  
Filbert soils are artificially drained and do not pond water.  
Scott soils are poorly or very poorly drained and have an A horizon less than 7 inches thick.
Sturges soils have chromas of 3 to 6 in parts of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loess
Landform: closed depressions on loess uplands and loess-covered stream terraces on river valleys
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 375 to 670 meters (1230 to 2200 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C (49 to 53 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 889 millimeters (20 to 35 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 137 to 173 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Butler, Crete, Massie, and Scott soils.  
Butler soils are on higher flat or slightly concave positions in the landscape and do not have an albic horizon.  
Massie and Scott soils occur in lower positions of closed depressions.  
Crete soils are on interfluves and hillslopes of loess uplands, are moderately well drained, and lack an albic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: Somewhat poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: low
Ponding: typically ponds water for brief durations (2 to 7 days) during the growing season but sometimes may extend to long durations (7 to 30 days).  Most ponding occurs between March through July. 
Saturation: has a perched seasonal high water table that ranges from 15 centimeters (6 inches) above the soil surface to about 61 centimeters (24 inches) below.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated.  
The main crops are corn, soybeans, sorghum, and wheat.  
The native vegetation is short and mid-prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and eastern Nebraska. Land Resource Regions H, G, and M; MLRAs 71, 75, 106, 102C, 65 and 66. The series is of large extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Adams County, Nebraska, 1923.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 81 centimeters (0 to 32 inches) (A, E, Bt1, Bt2 horizons) 
Albic horizon: The zone from 23 to 33 centimeters (9 to 13 inches) (E horizon) 
Argillic horizon:--The zone from 33 to 81 centimeters (13 to 32 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 horizons). 
Vertic features: The presence of linear Extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between 0 and 100 cm (0 to 40 inches). This was determined from lab data for Fillmore and similar soils. 

Terrace phases are recognized that have sand or coarse textured material below the loess cap at a depth of 3 to 10 meters (10 to 30 ft.).
A poorly drained, ponded phase is also recognized that has interpretations similar to the Scott series.

OSD Modification 6/2002RRZ 
Dark shot as described the E horizons of Fillmore soil is questionable as a natural occurring event.  This observation is probably due to tillage or drainage operations, which have destroyed or mixed some of the E horizon with Bt material containing the (shot-like) material. Possibly some freeze/thaw activities could move the concretions into the contact zone of the lower Bt horizon.  The silty clay loam surface layer is due to farming or landscaping activities.  Under natural conditions the surface layer is silt loam. Added redox information; added Sturges to competing series.
