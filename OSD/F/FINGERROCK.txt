FINGERROCK SERIES

The Fingerrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Fingerrock soils are on stream terraces, strath terraces and mesas overlain by alluvium .  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

Fourmile soils have rock fragments principally of granite lithology.

Norriston soils are less than 20 inches to a sandy-skeletal horizon.

Hoodle and Quander soils lack sandy-skeletal sub-horizons.

Libeg soils have greater than 10 percent clay in the BC or C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Routt County, Colorado, Routt County soil survey area, 2004.  The name Fingerrock comes from a nearby geological landmark.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 12 to 23 inches.  (Bt horizon)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 12 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 12 to 23 inches.  (Bt horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
