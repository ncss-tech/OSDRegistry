FRENCHCREEK SERIES

The Frenchcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Frenchcreek very gravelly loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; 55 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick).

    Bw1--5 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 60 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick).

    Bw2--12 to 26 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; 70 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C1--26 to 36 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose; slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 80 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    C2--36 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; 70 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0376, MT0088, MT0503.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed)(A, Bw1 horizons) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 26 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2, C1, C2 horizons)  

Frenchcreek soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
