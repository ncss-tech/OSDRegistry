FIVEPOINTS SERIES

The Fivepoints series consists of well drained soils moderately deep to dolostone.  These upland soils formed in a thin mantle of loess, in clayey pedisediment, and in loamy residuum from the underlying dolostone bedrock.  These soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Fivepoints silt loam on a convex, north-facing slope of 12 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 329 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) About 5 percent of the surface is covered by channers.  The fragments are dolostone and chert.

  Ap--0 to 18 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure;friable; many fine and medium roots; about 5 percent chert channers; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (15 to 23 centimeters thick)

  Bt1--18 to 25 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common distinct dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds; about 5 percent chert channers; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

  2Bt2--25 to 48 centimeters; dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay; strong medium and fine subangular blocky structure; firm; many distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; about 5 percent chert channers and about 3 percent dolostone and chert flagstones; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 38 centimeters thick)

  3Bt3--48 to 89 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very channery loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; thin residual coatings of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay occur around the dolostone rock fragments; about 35 percent dolostone channers; about 10 percent dolostone flagstones; neutral; abrupt irregular boundary.  (15 to 64 centimeters thick)

  3Rt--89 to 114 centimeters; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) hard fractured dolostone bedrock that is shattered in the upper part and has clay in the narrow and widely spaced fractures.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richland County, Wisconsin, 2002.  Source of the name is an unincorporated town in Richland County.

REMARKS: The clayey pedisediment is of uncertain origin.  It is thought to be a depositional feature and is locally referred as the "Rountree Formation". The pedisediment in Fivepoints is locally referred to as thin Rountree. It is high in clay like the classic Rountree but generally has brown colors and less coarse fragments than the soils with thicker Rountree materials.  It is felt that a horizon is always present consisting of residuum from the underlying bedrock.  This horizon can vary in thickness depending upon the position of the soil; lower shoulders often have thicker horizons than summits.  In Dane County, Wisconsin, the Dunbarton series will be correlated as Fivepoints on the update as a residuum layer will be recognized overlying the bedrock.  The Dunbarton series was mapped on both the Shakopee and Galena Formations.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters(Ap);
argillic horizon: 18 to 89 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, 3Bt3);
strongly contrasting particle size classes within the control section 18 to 69 centimeters
lithic contact:89 centimeters (3Rt)
