FORMDALE SERIES

The Formdale series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in fine-loamy till. These soils are on linear slopes on ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent Mean annual temperature is about  6 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about  645 millimeters.
