FAIRHAVEN SERIES

The Fairhaven series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying calcareous sandy and gravelly glacial outwash.  The Fairhaven soils are on stream terraces, outwash plains, and valley trains.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 725 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Fairhaven silt loam, on a nearly level slope, on an outwash plain, in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Bw1--38 to 64 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

 Bw2--64 to 75 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; about 3 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 20 to 57 centimeters.)

cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 38 to 75 centimeters (Bw horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
