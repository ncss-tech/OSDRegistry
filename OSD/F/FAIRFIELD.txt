FAIRFIELD SERIES

The Fairfield series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash, alluvium, colluvium and till.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, till plains, and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.
