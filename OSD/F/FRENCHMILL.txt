FRENCHMILL SERIES

The Frenchmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvial materials weathered from acid igneous rocks.  These soils are on mid and lower back slopes and foot slopes of mountain ridges. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Typic Paleudults

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Downsville series. Downsville soils have a mean annual temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F., and formed in alluvium on terraces.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frenchmill soils are on mid and lower back slopes and footslopes of mountain ridges.  Typically these soils have deeply entrenched drainageways.  These soils formed in colluvial materials weathered from acid igneous rocks.  Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delassus, Hassler, Irondale, Killarney, Knobtop, Skranka, Taumsauk, Tilk, and Trackler soils.  Delassus soils have a fragipan, have less than 15 percent rock fragments, and are on less sloping ridgetops and shoulder slopes above the Frenchmill soils.  Hassler soils are moderately deep and are on less sloping ridgetops, sideslopes and benches. Irondale and Knobtop soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on side slopes and ridgetops above Frenchmill soils.  Killarney soils have a fragipan and are on similar landscape positions.  Skranka soils are in the fine textural family, and are in basins.  Taumsauk soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and are on sideslopes above Frenchmill soils.  Tilk soils have a higher base saturation, and are on flood plains.  Trackler soils are deep to bedrock, have less than 35 percent rock fragments and are on ridgetops and shoulder slopes above the Frenchmill soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to high.  Permeability is moderate.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all areas are forested.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods and shortleaf pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The St. Francois Mountains of the Missouri Ozarks (MLRA 116C).  The series is of moderate extent.
