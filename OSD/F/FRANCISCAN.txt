FRANCISCAN SERIES

The Franciscan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains. These soils formed in material weathered from sedimentary and metamorphic rock. Slope is 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 8 to 15 inches thick and is always at least one-third as thick as the depth of the solum. The moisture control section of 9 to 20 inches is moist throughout from about November 15 to June 1 and dry throughout from about July 1 to October 15 most years. The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F from December 15 to March 1. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral, with pH gradually increasing with depth.

The A horizon has color of 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4. Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/3; 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3. Texture is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, loam or gravelly loam. Clay content is 10 to 20 percent. Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent. Cobble content is 0 to 8 percent. Organic matter content is 2 to 4 percent.

The Bt horizon has color of 7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/4; 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 or 6/6. Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 4/6.

Clay content is 20 to 35 percent and at least 1.2 times more clay than the A horizon. Sand content is 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section. Gravel content is 5 to 35 percent, typically increasing with depth. Cobble content is 0 to 30 percent.and 0 to 30 percent cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Foothill (T), Shimmon and Tejea (T) series. Foothill soils (MLRA 18), on mountain and hill slopes, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Shimmon soils (MLRA 15), on hills and mountains, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Tejea soils (MLRA 15), on hills and mountains, have A horizons that have clay content of 10 to 20 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Franciscan soils are on mountains. Slope is 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from sedimentary and metamorphic rock, commonly on slopes with northern aspects. Elevation is 500 to 4,970 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 24 inches. Mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature is about  61 degrees F. Frost-free season is 190 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ararat, Contra Costa, Fifield, Gilroy, Gonzaga, Honker, Millsholm and Quinto soils.  Ararat and Fifield soils, on mountains have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section. Contra Costa soils, on mountains, have a fine particle-size control section. Gilroy soils, on uplands, have color hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and commonly have medium acid reaction. Gonzaga and Honker soils, on mountains, have a fine particle-size control section and an abrupt clay increase from the A to the B horizon. Millsholm and Quinto soils, on mountains, have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches and do not have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high or very high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing. Vegetation is blue oak, live oak, foothill pine, California buckeye, California buckwheat, soft chess, red brome, wild oats and other annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Diablo Range in the California Coast Ranges. They are moderately extensive. MLRA-15.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Merced County, California, 1984.

REMARKS: Franciscan soils were formerly included with and mapped as the Vallecitos series in the Los Banos Area, California, 1939 Series Report.  They are being differentiated by having a horizontally continuous fine-loamy argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon.
Ballard, Bohna, Chualar, Chuloak, Gilroy, Pinto, Soper and Tehachapi series were not considered competing series for this update. All of these series need Cation-Exchange Activity Class determined. They are currently classified as fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Argixerolls. Most of these series will probably be placed in the Active Cation-Exchange Activity Class which will separate them taxonomically from Franciscan series. Ballard, Bohna, Chualar, Chuloak, Pinto and Tehachapi are very deep.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic Epipedon- the zone from 0 to 10 inches (A1, A2 horizons)

Lithic Contact- the boundary from 38 to 42 inches (R horizon)
