FRANEAU SERIES

The Franeau series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in clayey sediments of Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aransas and Harris series in the same family. Similar soils are the Francitas soils. 
Aransas soils:  Occur on flood plains and contain Holocene age sediments
Harris soils:  Occur on a lower landscape
Francitas soils:  are on higher landscape positions and are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods of time.

Parent material: clayey fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age
Landscape: coastal plains
Landform:  slight depression Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Microfeature: gilgai
Mean annual precipitation: 1219 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months
Thornthwaite annual P-E index:  68 to 80
Mean annual air temperature:  20.0 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beaumont, China, League, Meaton and Harris series.
Beaumont, China and League soils: are more acid; on slightly higher landform positions.
Meaton soils:  have an argillic horizon: on slightly higher landform positions.
Harris soils: are on lower lanform that are flooded daily by tide.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow. Runoff is negligible. An apparent water table occurs in the A and upper Bssg horizons for a period of several months in most years. These soils have aquic conditions in most years. Storm surges cover most areas below 5 ft elevation about 5 to 50 times in 100 years.  These soils have aquic conditions in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for native range and pasture. Native grasses are mainly gulf cordgrass, and species of andropogon and paspalum. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Gulf Coast Prairie of Texas, east of the Trinity River and possibly in western Louisiana; LRR T; MLRA 150A.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: The Franeau soils were formerly included with the Francitas series. The name Franeau is coined. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 69 cm (0 to 27 in) (A1, A2, Bssg1, Bssg2 horizon). 
Cambic horizon  69 to 203 cm (27 to 80 in) (Bssg3, Bssg4, Bssg5, and Bssg5 horizons). 
Aquic features - redoximorphic features 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) and aquic conditions in the upper part of the pedon in most years. 
Vertic features - Slickensides at a depth of 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). 
Natric features - SAR of 13 or more within 100 cm of the surface 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) higher than microdepressions. Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from about 2.4 to 4.9 m (8 to 16 ft). The amplitude of waviness between mollic colored materials in the upper part of the solum and the higher value colors in the lower part ranges from about 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in). The chimneys of high value materials on the microknolls make up less than 5 percent of the surface area. They are mainly 1.5 to 3 m (5 to 10 ft) long and 0.9 to 1.5 m) 3 to 5 ft wide. When dry, the soil has cracks 1/2 to 2 in wide at the surface and commonly 1.5 cm (1/2 in) wide cracks extend to a depth of 0.6 m (2 ft) during the summer.
