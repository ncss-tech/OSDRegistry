FORTLEWIS SERIES

The Fortlewis series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Fortlewis soils are on mountain slopes and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fortlewis stony fine sandy loam, on a south facing, simple, 15 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,500 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  Described on October 18, 1988.

    A--3 to 10 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) stony fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble, 15 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    E--10 to 30 cm; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) stony fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble, 15 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.   (5 to 30 cm thick)

    B/E--30 to 43 cm; (70 percent B) reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist, and (30 percent E) light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds of the B part; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble, 3 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.

(15 to 51 cm thick)

     Bt2--69 to 99 cm; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; strong medium subangular blocky and angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary.

    R--99 cm; sandstone bedrock, fractured in the upper few centimeters.
