FRANKVILLE SERIES

The Frankville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in oxidized and leached loess and a thin layer of residuum or a reddish paleosol high in clay overlying dolomitic limestone bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 centimeters. These soils are on crests of narrow interfluves, convex side slopes, and treads and risers of high structural benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs
