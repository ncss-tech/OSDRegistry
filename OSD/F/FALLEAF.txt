FALLEAF SERIES

The Falleaf series consists of very deep, well drained, soils on summits and back slopes of uplands. Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent slopes. These soils formed in loamy eolian and glacial fluvial material over till. Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 75 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: The zone from 25 to 157 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5 horizons)
Taxonomic Version: Tenth Edition, 2006.

This series was set up to take the place of the Konawa soil that was mapped on the bluffs north of the Kansas River. The Falleaf series is expected to be found on the shoulder and side slope positions of interfluves adjacent to the Kansas River. It is normally mapped in an undifferentiated map unit with the Grinter series.

ADDITIONAL DATA: There is currently no NSSL data for the typical pedon. Additional laboratory data--Kansas pedon: 00KS177005.
