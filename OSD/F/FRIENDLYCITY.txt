FRIENDLYCITY SERIES

The Friendlycity series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Friendlycity soils are on fluvial terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (49 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (56 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Humudepts

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Friendlycity soils are on fluvial terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Elevations are 12 to 25 meters (40 to 80 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 1015 to 1525 mm (40 to 60 inches).  The frost-free period is 300 to 360 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Weott, Canalschool, and Ferndale soils. Weott soils have redoximorphic feature within 10 centimeters of the soil surface and have ochric epipedons. Canalschool soils have redoximorphic features within 50 cm of the soil surface and have light colored epipedons.  Ferndale soils lack redoximorphic features above 100 cm and have ochric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; low runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used mainly for pasture and home site development. All areas of this soil have been cleared. Native vegetation is estimated to have been redwoods and alders.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is of small extent.
