FLYNNCOVE SERIES

The Flynncove series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite rocks.  Flynncove soils are on fan remnants and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, siliceous, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite rocksLandform:  fan remnants and mountain slopes
Slopes:  4 to 50 percent
Elevation: 6,800 to 9,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abracon, Clapper, Namon, Diagulch, Grapit, Lap, Morval, and Tridell series.

Abracon soils have an ochric epipedon.

Morval soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.

Diagulch soils do not have an argillic horizon.

Clapper soils occur on shoulders and have an ochric epipedon.

Namon soils occur on backslopes and have an ochric epipedon.

Grapit and Lap soils occur on mountain slopes and have carbonatic mineralogy.

Tridell soils occur on steep escarpments and do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow to medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, antelope bitterbrush, mountain big sagebrush, birchleaf mountainmahogany and Utah serviceberry.  These soils have been correlated to Mountain Stony Loam (Bitterbrush) - 047CY456UT, and Mountain Stony Loam (Browse) - 047CY460UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name is taken from a geographic location in the area.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 8 to 28 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 inches.  (A1, A2, Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 37 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)

Laboratory samples from similar geologic parent material and landscapes resulted in siliceous mineralogy.

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

Classification changed from Typic Argiborolls to superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 12/98.
