FERBALL SERIES 

The Ferball series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, strike valleys and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Ferball clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; slightly effervescent; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    Btk--5 to 12 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; few fine masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk1--12 to 45 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and few fine masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 48 inches thick) 

    Bk2--45 to 60 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and few fine masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Jefferson County, Montana; 200 feet south and 2,900 feet west of the NE corner of sec. 27, T. 2 N., R. 3 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature - 40 to 46 degrees F.
Depth to top of argillic horizon - 3 to 5 inches
Depth to Bk horizon - 10 to 15 inches

Note: Some pedons may have a Bt horizon above the Btk horizon.

Chroma: 3 to 6; dry or moist
Texture: loam or clay loam
Clay content: 22 to 30 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction: pH 7.4 to 8.4

Btk horizon
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR; dry or moist
Value: 5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4 to 8; dry or moist
Texture: loam, clay loam or silty clay loam
Clay content: 25 to 35 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 10 percent
Reaction: pH 7.9 to 8.4

Bk horizons
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR; dry or moist
Value: 5 or 6 dry; 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 4 to 8; dry or moist
Texture: loam, clay loam or silty clay loam
Clay content: 15 to 30 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 35 percent gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent
Reaction: pH 7.9 to 8.4

COMPETING SERIES:
Bondoe (MT) - have loamy-skeletal below the argillic horizon
Bonfri (MT) - is moderately deep to a paralithic contact
Chinatown (MT) - is moderately deep to a lithic contact
Fattig (MT) - is moderately deep to a lithic contact
Foreleft (MT) - does not have hues of 7.5YR or redder
Raghorn (MT) - does not have secondary calcium carbonate accumulation

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - alluvial fans, strike valleys and hills
Elevation - 3,800 to 6,300 feet
Slope - 2 to 35 percent
Parent material - alluvium or colluvium
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 16 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 80 to 115 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Redfist, Quaint and Quincreek series.  Quincreek and Redfist soils are on similar landforms, but have a loamy-skeletal family.  Quaint soils are on ridges and are less than 20 inches to lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Ferball soils are mainly used for rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needleleaf sedge, eriogonum, milkvetch, fringed sagewort, big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ferball soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0-5 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - from 5 to 12 inches (Btk horizon)
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - from 5 to 60 inches (Btk, Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 5 to 12 inches (Btk horizon)

Ferball soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
