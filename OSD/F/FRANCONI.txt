FRANCONI SERIES

The Franconi series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, ridges and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.
