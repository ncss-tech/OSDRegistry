FARRY SERIES

The Farry series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy and/or gravelly alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to moderately steep soils occur on treads and risers of stream terraces and terrace remnants on plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Farry fine sandy loam, on a 2 percent slope in rangeland, and an elevation of 573 m (1880 ft).
