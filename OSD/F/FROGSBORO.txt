Cherry Grove USGS topographic quadrangle; lat. 36 degrees 16 minutes 55.00 seconds N. and long. 79 degrees 26 minutes 16.00 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Linear extensibility totals 6.0 cm or more between the surface and parent material. Many pedons have few to many dark concretions throughout the profile. Many pedons have few to many dark mottles or soft bodies in the B and C horizons. Some pedons have few to many flakes of mica or crystals of feldspar in the B and C horizons. The soil is strongly acid to neutral in the A and BE horizons, strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the Bt and BC horizons, and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon. Content of rock fragments, up to 24 inches in diameter, ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout and may include pararock fragments. Clay content averages 60 to 70 percent in the control section. 

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

A thin or discontinuous E or EB horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

The upper part of the Btss horizon or Bt horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. The middle and lower part of the Btss horizon or Bt horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Content of clay in the Btss or Bt horizon ranges from 40 to 85 percent in the upper part and from 35 to 60 percent in the middle and lower part.  The weighted average content of clay of the upper 20 inches of the Btss or Bt horizon ranges from 50 to 65 percent.  Pressure faces are few to common and slickensides are usually present.

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Mottles may occur in shades of red brown, or yellow. Texture is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. 

The C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 or may be multicolored in shades of white, gray, brown, yellow, or black. It commonly is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.
