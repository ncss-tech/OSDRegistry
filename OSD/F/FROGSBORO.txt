REMARKS: This series was formerly included with Iredell soils. Iredell soils are moderately well drained and have mixed mineralogy.  The November 2025 revision updated the format.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 10 inches (A and EB horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 42 inches (Btss horizons)
Aquic conditions - the zone from 4 to 23 inches (BE, Btss1, and Btss2 horizons)
Aeric feature - the zone from 10 to 30 inches (Btss1, Btss2, Btss3 horizons)
