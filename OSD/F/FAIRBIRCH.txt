FAIRBIRCH SERIES

The Fairbirch series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fairbirch silt loam, in irrigated hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 13 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    A2--13 to 38 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 cm)

    Bg1--38 to 58 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common fine prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) redox concentrations, moist; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm)

    Bg2--58 to 91 cm; light gray (5Y 7/2) gravelly loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) redox concentrations, moist; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bg horizons is 25 to 80 cm thick)

    2Cg--91 to 150 cm; light gray (5Y 7/2) very gravelly loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) redox concentrations, moist; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.3).

SERIES PROPOSED:  Meagher County, Montana, 1992.  Fairbirch is a coined name.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 38 cm (A1, A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 38 to 91 cm (Bg1, Bg2 horizons)
Loamy skeletal material - the zone from 91 to 150 cm (2Cg horizon)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (A2, Bg1, Bg2, 2Cg horizons)

Fairbirch soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
