FUNNEL SERIES

The Funnel series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium over sand and gravel derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, smectitic over mixed, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Funnel silty clay loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 1765 meters (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oe--0 to 8 cm; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

 A--8 to 18 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

 Bw--18 to 51 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak coarse and very coarse subangular blocky structure; rigid, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (30 to 61 cm thick)

 Bg--51 to 61 cm; very dark greenish gray (5GY 3/1) clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; many medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; massive; rigid, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

 2C--61 to 152 cm; variegated extremely gravelly sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - stream terraces
Elevation - 1700 to 1890 meters
Slope - 0 to 4 percent. 
Parent material - clayey alluvium over sand and gravel derived from mixed sources
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; short warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 225 to 260 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; very slow over very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Funnel soils are used mainly for irrigated grass hay, irrigated pasture and rangeland.  The vegetation is mainly Garrison creeping foxtail, meadow foxtail, timothy, tufted hairgrass, Poa (species), and other miscellaneous sedges, rushes, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Funnel soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRA - 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Horse Prairie-South Valley Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2011; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2008.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 8 to 61 cm (A, Bw, Bg horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity - at 61 (2C horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 33 to 108 cm (part of Bw, Bg, part of 2C horizons).

Funnel soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
