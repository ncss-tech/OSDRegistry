FORT DODGE SERIES

The Fort Dodge series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foot slopes, alluvial fans, upland drainageways, treads and risers on stream terraces. These soils formed in loamy colluvium or alluvium overlying coarse textured sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Fort Dodge loam, on a south-facing footslope of about 2 percent, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise indicated.)

    Bw1--99 to 127 centimeters (39 to 50 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic stains on faces of peds; about 2 percent coarse fragments in lower part; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2--127 to 147 centimeters (50 to 58 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine tubular pores; common distinct dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic stains on faces of peds; about 3 percent coarse fragments; many fine shale fragments; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 20 to 61 centimeters (8 to 24 inches)].

    2C--147 to 203 centimeters (58 to 80 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 3 percent coarse fragments; neutral.
