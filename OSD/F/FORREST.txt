FORREST SERIES 

The Forrest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium.  Forrest soils are on basin floors, fan terraces, and fan piedmonts and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

Soil Temperature:  59 to 70 degrees F. 

Rock Fragments:  Averages less than 35 percent in the control section; can range to 50 percent in any one subhorizon

Some pedons have Btk horizons

Some pedons contain trace amounts of gypsum throughout.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bernardino (AZ), Penthouse (AZ) and Stellar (NM) series.  Bernardino soils have a calcic horizon above 20 inches.  Penthouse soils have textures finer than moderately fine in the series control section.  Stellar soils have a much lower mean annual rainfall component and are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Forrest soils are on basin floors, fan terraces, and fan piedmonts and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,200 feet.  These soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 250 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bernardino and White House soils.  In addition is the Caralampi soil.  Caralampi soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained;  slow or medium runoff;  slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Forrest soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is sideoats grama, black grama, cane beardgrass, plains lovegrass, blue grama, hairy grama, sand dropseed, vine mesquite, curly mesquite, false mesquite, Mormon-tea, mimosa, yucca, ocotillo, cacti and agave. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Arizona and Southwestern New Mexico.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 41.
