FAYETTE SERIES

These soils are on convex crests, interfluves and side slopes on uplands and on treads and risers on high stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fayette County, Iowa, 1919.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 36 to 86 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (A, E1, E2, BE, Bt1, Bt2, BC, and C horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 centimeters (A, E1, E2 and BE horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 8 to 28 centimeters (E1 and E2 horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 86 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The thickness of the A and E horizons, depth to subhorizon highest in clay content, maximum percent clay thickness of the Bt horizon, depth to carbonates, and depth to redoximorphic features usually decrease as gradient increases on convex slopes.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data from National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.

Clay content in the particle-size control section and lower third of the series control section is based on analysis of laboratory data (NSSL)
