FIREBRICK SERIES

The Firebrick series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from sandstone. The Firebrick soils are on hills. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 570 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Amador County, California, about 1.25 miles SE of Buena Vista on Buena Vista Rd; 630 meters NNW of the SE corner of sec. 17, T. 5 N., R. 10 E., MDB&M; WGS84 38.285455 latitude and -120.893521 longitude; UTM zone 10 684234 meters E 4239586 meters N NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm depth is 15 to 17 degrees. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a thermic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The Firebrick soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about June to October (about 120 days).

Diagnostic Feature(s):
  Ochric epipedon thickness: 8 to 18 cm
  Depth to abrupt textural change: 10 to 50 cm
  Argillic horizon thickness: 20 to 35 cm
  Depth to paralithic contact: 25 to 50 cm

Base saturation: less than 35 percent (by sum of cations) at the paralithic contact.

  Rock fragments: 0 to 30 percent, with 0 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles 
  Clay content: 18 to 35 percent 
  More than 50 percent (by weight) kaolinite in the clay fraction 
  More than 4 percent iron oxide (by weight)

Some pedons have a densic contact above the paralithic contact with a top depth ranging from 15 to 25 cm and a thickness of 5 to 20 cm.  These densic materials are like the paralithic materials except when air-dried and soaked, they slake.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Firebrick soils are on hills. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. These soils formed in residuum from sandstone of the Ione Formation. Elevation is 50 to 235 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 420 to 610 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 16 to 17 degrees C. The frost-free season is 320 to 355 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mokelumne soils. The Mokelumne soils are on footslopes of hills and are moderately deep to paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is chamise, manzanita, yerba santa, gray pine, and annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. These soils are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Amador County, California, 2025. Firebrick is a placename near the series type location.

REMARKS: 
  Particle Size Control Section for this pedon: 10 to 38 cm
  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
     Ochric Epipedon            0 to 10 cm
     Abrupt Textural Change     28 cm
     Argillic Horizon           10 to 38 cm
     Paralithic Contact         38 cm
     Paralithic Materials       38 to 75 cm

This pedon has an abrupt textural change within the particle size control section that would qualify as "loamy over clayey," but there is no strongly contrasting particle size class for this combination.

Clay mineralogy qualifies as "kaolinitic," but this does not apply to particle size families other than clayey or fine, so mineralogy is "mixed".

The underlying sandstone bedrock has evidence of being deeply weathered with paralithic materials greater than 25 cm thick below the paralithic contact.
