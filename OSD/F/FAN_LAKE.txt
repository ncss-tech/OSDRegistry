FAN LAKE SERIES

The Fan Lake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits or Latah formation with a thin mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Fan Lake soils are on relict glacial lake terraces, outwash terraces and convex toeslopes of foothills. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fugawee, Henneway, Neva, and Tahand series. Fugawee soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Henneway soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Neva soils lack fragic properties and redox concentrations or depletions, are dry for 45 to 75 consecutive days, and are considered well drained. Tahand soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. A Similar soil with mixed mineralogy is the Witcher series. Witcher soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fan Lake soils are on terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 2,400 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent, but predominant are 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits or Latah formation with a thin mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Fan Lake soils are in a continental climate having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bridgeson, Eloika, and Wolfeson soils. Bridgeson soils are fine-loamy and are in drainageways. Eloika soils are ashy over loamy and are on glacial outwash terraces. Wolfeson soils are coarse-loamy and are on relict glacial lake terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. A perched water table is at its uppermost limit from January through April.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for the production of alfalfa, small grains, grasses, or seed crops. Some areas are used for livestock grazing, timber production, and wildlife habitat. The potential natural vegetation is grand fir, Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, and western larch with an understory of oceanspray, common snowberry, mallow ninebark, oregon grape, longtube twinflower, meadow rue, and pinegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. MLRA 44A. Series is not extensive.
