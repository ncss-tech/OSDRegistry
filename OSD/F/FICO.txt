FICO SERIES

The Fico series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from granite or gneiss with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. They are on mountain slopes and ridges. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high in the lower part. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 46 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fico soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 3,300 to 5,800 feet with slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  These soils are formed in residuum from granite or gneiss with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. and the average precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The frost free season is 30 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Vassar, and Weitas series. Vassar soils are on smooth to concave mountain side slopes, are frigid and have deep volcanic ash mantles. Weitas soils are on concave mountain side slopes and ridges, are cryic and have umbric epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the upper part and high in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, Douglas fir, western redcedar, and grand fir with an understory of arrowleaf groundsel, wild ginger, starry false Solomons seal, goldthread, queencup beadily, baneberry, miners lettuce, false bugbane, and rustyleaf menziesia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho.  Fico soils are not extensive, about 5,000 acres in size.
