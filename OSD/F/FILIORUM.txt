FILIORUM SERIES


The Filiorum series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from calcareous shale. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent and are on nearly level to moderately sloping marine terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 340 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Aridic Haploxererts

TYPICAL PEDON: Filiorum clay, on a marine terrace at an elevation of 46 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from a depth of 0 to 80 cm
Slickensides - the zone from a depth of 12 to 80 cm
Secondary calcium carbonates - the zone from a depth of 12 to 170 cm
Particle-size control section - the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 cm

A few pedons that do not have calcium carbonate were included in this concept.  It is an uncommon condition.
