FORT ROCK SERIES

The Fort Rock series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff. Fort Rock soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fort Rock soils are on lake terraces. These soils formed in volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff. Most of the pumiceous volcanic ash is from ancestral Mt. Mazama (current site of Crater Lake). Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 1,480 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abert, Bonnick, Kunceider, Morehouse, and Wegert soils. Abert soils are ashy, have a Bk horizon, and are on adjacent nearly level lake terraces. Bonnick soils are deep to stratified gravel and sand. Kunceider soils are ashy-skeletal, shallow to bedrock, and are on adjacent lava plains. Morehouse soils have a 2Bk horizon that is loam or silt loam and are on adjacent nearly level lake terraces and dunes. Wegert soils are ashy, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on adjacent lava plains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Fort Rock soils are used for irrigated alfalfa hay and barley production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, needleandthread, Ross sedge, Indian ricegrass, and basin wildrye. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lake County (Northern Part), Oregon, 2006. The series was first proposed in Lake County, Oregon in 1959. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 46 cm (A horizon and part of the BA horizon). 
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 71 cm (A, BA, and Bw1 horizon). 
Major lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to sandy material at 71 cm (2Bw2 and 2Bq horizons and part of the 3C horizon). 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw1, 2Bw2, and 2Bq horizons and part of the 3C horizon). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: A prior typical pedon was sampled and characterized as soil survey sample number S79OR-037-007. The typical pedon at the current series type location was reference sampled as soil survey sample number S94OR-037-001. Data for particle-size analysis, organic carbon content, optical grain counts, and acid oxalate extractions are available for the first three horizons of the typical pedon.
