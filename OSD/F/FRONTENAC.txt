FRONTENAC SERIES

The Frontenac series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments over loamy-skeletal residuum and/or colluvium primarily from limestone. These soils are on slightly convex to slightly concave northwest-facing to southeast-facing slopes on the upper part of foot slopes and the middle and upper parts of valley slopes in dissected terrain. Slope ranges from 15 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 30 centimeters (A and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 102 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, and 2BC horizons);
udic moisture regime. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
