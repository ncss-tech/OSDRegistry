FILAREE SERIES

The Filaree series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively to well drained soils on fan terraces and fan aprons. These soils are formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Filaree gravelly sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

	A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

	Bw1--2 to 18 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. 

	Bw2--18 to 34 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 19 to 40 inches.) 

	Bk--34 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). 

TYPE LOCATION: Mohave County, Arizona; 4 miles west and 5.5 miles north of Chloride; about 200 feet west and 2,300 feet north of the southeast corner of section 3, T.24 N., R.19 W; 35 degrees, 31 minutes, 79 seconds north latitude and 114 degrees, 19 minutes, 38 seconds west longitude. Gila and Salt River Base Meridian.

Soil Temperature: 59 to 72 degrees F. 

Effervescence: Noneffervescent to 20 inches or more 

Control section: Clay content: Ranges from 5 to 20 percent but averages 18 percent or less in the particle-size control section

Rock fragments  5 to 30 percent mainly pebbles.

Effervesence  Strongly or violently effervescent. 

Reaction  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. 

Secondary carbonate accumulations -  Thin carbonate films on the bottoms of rock fragments or randomly oriented

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Agustin (TX), Hayhook (AZ), Lostman (AZ), Nasagold (CA), Pajarito (NM), Pyxo (CA) and Sahuarita (AZ) series. Agustin, Lostman, and Pajarito soils are moderately alkaline and calcareous above 20 inches. Hayhook, Pajarito and Sahuarita soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative during July-September. Nasagold soils are receive less total rainfall, are effervescent above 20 inches and have lower average clay content in the control section. Pyxo soils are moderately deep to sedimentary bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Filaree soils are on fan terraces and fan aprons. Elevations are 2,000 to 4,000 feet. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F. The frost free period is 200 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fig, Nodman, Dutchflat, and Arizo soils. Fig and Nodman soils are very shallow to bedrock. Arizo and Dutchflat soils are very deep. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively to well drained; low runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes big galleta, rayless goldenhead, black grama and white burrobush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of western Arizona and southern Nevada; MLRA is 30. Filaree soils are of moderate extent.
