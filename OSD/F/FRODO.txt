FRODO SERIES

The Frodo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basaltic rock.  Frodo soils are on remnants of lava plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey, smectitic, mesic, shallow Paleargidic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Frodo extremely stony loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

(3 or 5 cm thick)

    A2--3 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky parting to weak thin and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--15 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium prismatic parting to strong medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 30 cm thick)

    Btk--41 to 46 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frodo soils are on remnants of lava plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basaltic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barshaad, Tristan, and Xman soils.  Barshaad and Xman soils do not have duripans.  Tristan soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Frodo soils are used for rangeland.  The native vegetation is low sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.
