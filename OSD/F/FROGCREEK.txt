FROGCREEK SERIES

The Frogcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are deep to a densic contact. These soils formed in loess or silty alluvium over loamy alluvium underlain by dense sandy or loamy lodgement till on disintegration moraines. Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle, moderately slow in the loamy alluvium and slow in the dense till. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Washburn County, Wisconsin; about 30 miles northeast of Spooner; about 1,850 feet north and 2,100 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 33, T. 41 N., R. 10 W.; USGS Stanberry West topographic quadrangle; lat. 46 degrees 04 minutes 34 seconds N., and long. 91 degrees 37 minutes 36 seconds W.; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of sand coarser than very fine averages 15 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy alluvium, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium, and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the silty mantle, but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy alluvium and from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations occur within 40 inches. If present, iron depletions are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in normal years. Free carbonates are absent to 80 inches or more.

Frogcreek soils have a glossic horizon. Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree to which eluviation has occurred. Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination. 

The E part of the E/B or B/E horizon, has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam.
Some pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above. Clay content ranges from 8 to 17 percent.

The 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon, has color like the E horizon described above. Texture is loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs. The 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.  Bulk Density is 1.65 to 1.85 gm/cc.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aftad, Blowers, Freeon, Milaca, Neopit, Sconsin and Scott Lake series. Aftad, Blowers, Neopit, Sconsin and Scott Lake soils do not have densic material within the series control section. Freeon and Milaca soils average more than 7 percent clay in the dense till. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Formed in loess or silty alluvium over loamy alluvium underlain by dense sandy or loamy lodgement till.
Landform: Disintegration moraines.
Slope: 2 to 15 percent.
Elevation: 1000 to 1500 feet.
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches.
Frost-free days: 110 to 135 days.
 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Parkfalls, Stanberry, Stinnett, and Wozny) soils. The somewhat poorly drained Parkfalls soils are on lower or less sloping landscape positions and do not have a silty mantle. The somewhat poorly drained Stinnett and very poorly drained Wozny soils form a hydrosequence with Frogcreek soils. The moderately well drained Stanberry soils are on similar landscape positions, but do not have a silty mantle.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is low to high. Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle, moderately slow in the loamy alluvium, and slow in the dense till. Frogcreek soils have seasonal saturation perched above the densic contact at a depth of 2 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more at some time during the period of September to June in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest with some conifers. Common trees are sugar maple, red maple, black cherry, American basswood, white ash, American elm, bigtooth aspen, quaking aspen, balsam fir, northern red oak, and eastern hophornbeam with some eastern white pine. Some areas are cleared and used for pastureland or cropland. Corn, small grain, and hay are the common crops. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Wisconsin. LRR K and MLRA 90A. This soil is of small extent.
