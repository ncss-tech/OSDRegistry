FOUTS SERIES

The Fouts series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain sideslopes.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from schist, shale, and graywacke. Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Fouts gravelly loam, in an area of Fouts-Yorkville-Frogwoman Association, 15 to 50 percent slopes, woodland.  When described on September 3, 1980, the soil was dry to 18 inches and slightly moist below.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 6 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) gravelly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravels; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt1--6 to 12 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) very gravelly clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravels; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--12 to 18 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) very gravelly clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravels; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt3--18 to 26 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) very gravelly clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravels; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.

    R--26 inches; hard dark schist, fractures to 0.5 to 3 inch fragments.

TYPE LOCATION: Colusa County, California; about 1/2 mile northeast of Fouts Springs, about 1800 feet north and 1200   feet west of the southeast corner of section 32, T. 18 N., R. 7 W., MDB&M; about 39 degrees, 22 minutes, 07 seconds North latitude and 122 degrees, 39 minutes, 30 seconds West longitude;  USGS Fouts Springs CA Quadrangle.

RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The 6 to 20 inch SMCS is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 31 and moist in all parts from November 1 to May 31.

The A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/2, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/2. Texture is gravelly loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

The Bt horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/1, 4/4; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4. Texture is very gravelly clay loam and very gravelly clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fouts soils are on convex steep sideslopes on south aspects. Elevations are 2000 to 4600 feet.  They formed residuum weathered from sandstone and greenstone.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The climate has warm, dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., mean July temperature is 54 degrees F, mean annual temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 60 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 125 to 185 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Frogwoman and Yorkville soil. Yorkville soils are very deep and Frogwoman soils have light colored A and Bt horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing. Native vegetation is annual grasses and forbs with scattered blue oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coast Range of northern California, MLRA 15. The soil is not extensive.
