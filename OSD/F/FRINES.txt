FRINES SERIES

The Frines series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from welded tuff.  The Frines soils are on crests of low foothills.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Frines gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 40 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 8 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong thick platy structure parting to strong thin platy; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine, common fine and medium vesicular and common fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Btk1--8 to 18 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; strongly effervescent in isolated spots; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Btk2--18 to 33 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine, few fine and medium tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 15 percent gravel; many moderately thick strongly effervescent lime coatings on undersides of rock fragments; slightly effervescent matrix; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bk--33 to 61 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; lime coatings on all sides of rock fragments; 50 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 36 cm thick)

    Cr--61 to 119 cm; weathered tuff with many thin lime coatings on faces of fractures and common very fine roots in the upper fractures.  (35 to 75 cm thick)

    R--119 cm; welded tuff.

TYPE LOCATION: Pershing County, Nevada; approximately 4 miles west of Toy, about 2,500 feet west and 2,400 feet south of the northeast corner of section 20, T. 25 N., R. 29 E; longitude 40 degrees 01 minutes and 16 seconds N and latitude 118 degrees 45 minutes and 01 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.0217778 latitude, -118.7488889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture Usually dry, moist for short periods in the winter and spring, dry late May through November; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 50 to 76 cm.
Depth to lithic contact: 100 to 150 cm.
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 25 to 43 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments: 0 to 25 percent, mainly gravel.

Btk horizons
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist.
Texture: Clay or gravelly clay loam.
Structure: Subangular blocky, prismatic or is massive.
Consistence: Very plastic or plastic wet.
Carbonates: The upper subhorizons are non-effervescent or slightly effervescent in the matrix.  The lower subhorizons are slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent in the matrix.  Subhorizons of some pedons lack secondary carbonates.

Bk horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry; 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist.
Texture: Gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.
Clay content: 3 to 10 percent.
Rock fragments: 20 to 50 percent, mainly gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ratsnest series. 

Ratsnest soils contain free carbonates below 25 to 53 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frines soils are on crests of low foothills.  These soils formed in residuum derived from welded tuff.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,375 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Envol soils.  Envol soils are shallow to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, Bailey greasewood, bud sagebrush, pine bluegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Nevada.  MLRA 27. These soils are not extensive.
