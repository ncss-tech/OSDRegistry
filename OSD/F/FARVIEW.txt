FARVIEW SERIES

The Farview series consists of very shallow, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and residuum and eolian material derived from sandstone.  Farview soils are on summits of mesas and structural benches, and on dipslopes of cuestas. Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Farview channery loamy sand -- on a structural bench sloping 6 percent to the southeast at 6,460 feet elevation -- rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When first described, the soil was moist from 1 inch to the bedrock contact.)

    A -- 0 to 2 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) channery loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; 5 percent gravel and 15 percent channers; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk -- 2 to 6 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) channery sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and common very fine roots; 5 percent pebbles and 10 percent channers; violently effervescent, secondary calcium carbonates segregated in few fine and medium irregularly shaped accumulations on rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    R -- 6 inches; hard sandstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Farview soils are on summits of mesas and structural benches and dipslopes of cuestas. They formed in alluvium and eolian material derived dominantly from Cretaceous sandstone. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,900 to 6,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 13 inches, but some areas are as low as 8 or 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beclabito, Doakum, McElmo, Sanostee, and Snapill soils. Beclabito soils are deep with natric horizons on toeslopes intermingled with Farview soils. Doakum and Snapill soils are deep with argillic horizons on open mesa and plateau summits. McElmo soils are deep with natric and calcic horizons on cuesta dipslopes. Sanostee soils are moderately deep with argillic and calcic horizons on adjacent toeslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and somewhat excessively drained, very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Farview soils are used for livestock grazing and limited woodland production.  Present vegetation is Utah juniper and scattered relict pinyon, with an understory of New Mexico feathergrass, Indian ricegrass, Bigelow sagebrush, Stansbury cliffrose, true mountain mahogany, and singleleaf ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Farview soils are of moderate extent on the Four Corners Platform and Blanding Basin portions of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico, northeast Arizona and southwest Colorado.  LRR-D; MLRA 35 and 36.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 2 inches. (A horizon)

Lithic contact - The presence of hard sandstone bedrock at about 6 inches.
