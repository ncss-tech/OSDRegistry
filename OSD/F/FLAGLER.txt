FLAGLER SERIES

The Flagler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of moderately coarse-textured alluvium and the underlying coarse-textured alluvium. These soils occur on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Flagler fine sandy loam, on a west-facing slope of less than 1 percent, in a pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 A1--20 to 38 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) coats on peds; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; very friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 A2--38 to 56 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine granular; friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 30 to 60 centimeters.)

 Bw--56 to 84 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; friable; few small pebbles; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (20 to 50 centimeters thick)

 2C--84 to 165 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy sand; single grain; loose; stratified in lower part with thin strata (2 to 20 millimeters in thickness) of brown (7.5YR 4/2) fine sand; about 12 percent gravel; slightly acid.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:

cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 56 centimeters to 84 centimeters (Bw horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Cation exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
