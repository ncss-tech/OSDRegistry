FOSTORIA SERIES

The Fostoria series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial sediments of mixed lithology.  These soils are on nearly level to slightly concave positions on till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clay County, Iowa, 1975.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 48 centimeters (Ap, A1 and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 86 centimeters (BA, Bg and Bk horizons);
udic moisture regime.

A lacustrine substratum phase was correlated in Clay County, Iowa and is of very minor extent.  It is on a lake plain.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
