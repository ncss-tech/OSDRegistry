FLOATYBOG SERIES

The Floatybog series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from glacial outwash materials from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Floatybog soils are on outwash terraces and fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic, frigid Terric Haplohemists

TYPICAL PEDON: Floatybog mucky peat--Pastureland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oe1--0 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) mucky peat, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; 75 percent unrubbed and 40 percent rubbed fibers; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid, (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 36 cm thick)

 Oe2--25 to 61 cm; mucky peat, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; 60 percent unrubbed and 25 percent rubbed fibers; weak fine granular structure; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid, (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 50 cm thick)

 A--61 to 74 cm; mucky loam, black (N 2.5/) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; slightly acid, (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

 Cg1--74 to 114 cm; sandy loam, gray (N 5/) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist, masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral, (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (30 to 50 cm thick)

 Cg2--114 to 152 cm; sandy loam, greenish gray (5GY 5/1) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist, masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral, (pH 6.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Mono County, California; in the Bridgeport Valley, about 5 miles southwest of Bridgeport; about 700 feet west of the southeast corner of section 14, T. 4 N., R. 24 E.; Twin Lakes USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 11 minutes 57.5 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 17 minutes 20.0 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.1993056 latitude, -119.2888889 longitude.

Clay content: 18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: Less than 15 percent.
Organic matter content: 0.25 to 1 percent.
Redoximorphic features: Redox concentrations occur as masses of iron or manganese accumulation in the matrix.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the McLangor, Tacoosh and Ventero series.  

Mclangor soils always have an Oa horizon and have mineral layers with less than 15 percent clay.  Tacoosh soils have 10 to 20 percent coarse woody fragments in their organic layers.  Ventero soils lack mucky modified layers below their organic layers and have more than 27 percent clay in their underlying mineral layers.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Floatybog soils are on outwash terraces, toeslopes and fans.  They formed in alluvium derived from glacial outwash materials from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eastwalker and Goodbye series.  Eastwalker and Goodbye soils do not have thick layers of organic material.  In addition, Eastwalker soils have an aquic moisture regime, and Goodbye soils have an aridic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained; very high surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table at the surface (very shallow free water occurrence classes) year around. Cumulative annual duration class is Permanent.  Frequent ponding at a depth of 3 to 15 cm is present for very long duration during most of the year.

USE AND VEGETATION: Floatybog soils are used for pastureland, watershed and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly sedges. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
