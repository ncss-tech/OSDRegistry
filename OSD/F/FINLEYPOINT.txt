FINLEYPOINT SERIES 

The Finleypoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till, glacial drift, or colluvium.  These soils are on moraines, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.
