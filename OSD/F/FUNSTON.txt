FUNSTON SERIES

The Funston series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks. The Funston soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Aquandic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Funston sand on a northeast-facing (70 degree), 2 percent slope under a canopy of black cottonwood and lodgepole pine at an elevation of 1996 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on July 25, 2016 the soil was moist throughout.)

 C--0 to 6 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; 3 percent clay; structureless single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent rounded indurated granite gravel; NaF pH 7.5; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

 A/C--6 to 26 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) highly organic coarse sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; 3 percent clay; structureless single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent rounded indurated granite gravel; NaF pH 8.5; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 25 cm thick)

 Cg1--26 to 58 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly coarse sand, 30 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) oxidized and 70 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) reduced moist; 1 percent clay; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent medium prominent irregular yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist, masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries throughout; 55 percent rounded indurated granite gravel; NaF pH 8.0; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual smooth boundary. 

 Cg2--58 to 150 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly coarse sand, 30 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) oxidized and 70 percent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) reduced moist; 1 percent clay; structureless single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent medium prominent irregular yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist, masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries throughout; 75 percent rounded indurated granite gravel; NaF pH 8.0; moderately acid (pH 5.8).(combined thickness of Cg horizons is 50 to 150 cm)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Funston soils are on linear to concave flood plains and flood-plain steps of glacial-valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks. Elevation is 1845 to 3115 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation 445 to 1350 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 3 to 9 degrees C. The frost free season is 60 to 145 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pineridge and Wager soils. The Pineridge soils are somewhat poorly or poorly drained soils on flood plain steps, have an umbric epipedon, and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. The Wager soils are very poorly drained organic soils on floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly or very poorly drained, moderately high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity, occasional to frequent flooding for very brief to long (4 hours to 30 days) duration from May to July, occasional to frequent ponding for brief to long duration from May to July. Seasonal high water table at 0 to 25 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is carex, horsetail, Sierra willow, Lemmon's willow, lodgepole pine, quaking aspen, and black cottonwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are not extensive.
