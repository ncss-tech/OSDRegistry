FORTBENTON SERIES 

The Fortbenton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian material over glacial till, glaciofluvial, or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fortbenton fine sandy loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong, very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bw1--6 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bw2--13 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (9 to 17 inches thick) 

    2Bk1--23 to 32 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; many fine and medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick) 

    2Bk2--32 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; many fine and medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1152.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 13 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); cambic horizon - from 13 to 23 inches (Bw2 horizon); horizon of lime accumulation - from 23 to 60 inches (2Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons).  Fortbenton soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
