FLOODWOOD SERIES 

The Floodwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from anorthosite, schist, and gneiss with a mantle of volcanic ash.  The Floodwood soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and foothills. Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 10 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Lakestarr series. Lakestarr soils have a densic contact at 40 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Floodwood soils are on north, east, and west facing aspects of mountain slopes, ridges and foothills.  These soils formed in material weathered from anorthosite, schist, and gneiss, with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 10 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 1,600 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is cool, humid with warm, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 65 inches and the average annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Garveson, Keeler (T), and Odonnell (T) soils.  Garveson soils are on canyon slopes and are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Keeler soils are on south-facing convex slopes and have a low content of volcanic ash.  Odonnell soils are on concave toe slopes, and have E horizons and are moderately well drained. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western larch, with an understory of oakfern, queencup beadlily, goldthread, bunchberry dogwood, American maidenhair fern, common prince's pine, Oregon fairybells, starry-false-Solomon's-seal, wild ginger, and arrowleaf groundsel. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  This soil is not extensive.
