FLUE SERIES

The Flue series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in a surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Flue soils are on fan remnants and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Cortez series.  Cortez soils do not have Bq horizons in the lower part of the eolian mantle and do not have thin horizons high in carbonates between the natric horizon and the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flue soils are on fan remnants and plateaus.  These soils formed in a surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,737 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golconda, Orovada, Puett, and Snapp soils.  Golconda soils are fine-loamy and have a typic aridic moisture regime.  Orovada soils do not have argillic horizons and duripans.  Puett soils are shallow to paralithic contacts and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Snapp soils do not have duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Flue soils are used for irrigated cropland, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.   The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 24.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A1, A2, and Bq horizons).
Natric horizon - The zone from 33 to 81 cm (2Btnk and 2Btnqk horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 33 to 152 cm (2Btnk, 2Btnqk, 2Bqk, 2Bqkm, and 3Cqk horizons)
Duripan - The zone from 89 to 102 cm (2Bqkm horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 33 to 81 cm (2Btnk and 2Btnqk horizons).

The revision of November 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, mesic Xeric Natridurids based on the parent material for the eolian mantle and laboratory data on sand mineralogy.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Flue has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S88NV-013-007 (pedon # 88P0696).  A similar taxadjunct is S86NV-013-303 (pedon # 86P0766).
