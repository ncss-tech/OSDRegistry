FORMATION SERIES

The Formation series consists of very deep, well drained soils that weathered from travertine residuum with some loess influence. Formation soils have slopes of 0 to 6 percent in drainageways and travertine terraces in valleys. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Formation loam, pastureland; on a 1 percent slope at 1872 meters. When described on July 18, 1989 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A2--10 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary

 A3--23 to 43 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine irregular and tubular pores; 1 percent 4-to 8-mm snail shell fragments; 65 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary 

 C1--43 to 74 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular and tubular pores; 1 percent 4- to 8-mm diameter snail shell fragments; 75 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary
