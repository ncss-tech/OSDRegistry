FRUITA SERIES

The Fruita series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on stream and strath terraces. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Gypimack and Gyprockmesa soils occur on similar landforms. Gypimack soils have a calcic horizon. Gyprockmesa soils have a gypsic horizon below 100 cm and have cobbles and stones in the lower part of the subsoil.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate and moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mostly for irrigated cropland and urban development. Native vegetation consists of shadscale saltbush, Gardner's saltbush, galleta, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Fruita soils are of moderate extent in western Colorado and west-central Wyoming. MLRA 32 and 34B.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 5 cm (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - from 5 to 56 cm (Btk1, Btk2, and Btk3 horizons)
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - from 5 to 165 cm (Btk1, Btk2, Btk3, Bk and Bky horizons)
Gypsic horizon - from 81 to 165 cm (Bky horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 5 to 55 cm (Btk1, Btk2 and part of the Btk3 horizon)

Fruita soils have a mesic temperature regime and an aridic moisture regime.

Note: Fruita soils in Wyoming are still classified as Fine-loamy, mixed superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids, which is the pre-April-2004 taxonomic classification. These soils need to be investigated to determine correct series assignment.
