FORBORD SERIES

The Forbord Series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and ash mixed with colluvium and slope alluvium over basalts, rhyolites, pyroclastic tuffs and mesozoic marine sediments. Forbord soils are on sideslopes and benches of hills and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature about 41 degrees F.
