FUERTES SERIES

The Fuertes series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in fine-loamy alluvium derived from derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist. Fuertes soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

Stunner soils have a calcic horizon 
Eastdale soils do not have an argillic horizon
Ventero soils have histic epipedon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained, low runoff, moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as native pastureland and for irrigated meadows. Occasionally, some areas are used for small grains. Principal native plants are sedges, rushes, saltgrass, and other water-tolerant grasses and plants. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: High intermountain valleys of south central Colorado, LLR E, MLRA 51.  The series is of minor extent.  

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Costilla County, Colorado, Costilla soil survey area, 2009. The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 22 inches. (A, Bt and Btk horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 3 to 40 inches. (Bt,Bt1, Btk, and Bt2 horizons)
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
