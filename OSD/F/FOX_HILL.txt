GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Barrier Islands 
Landform: Low dunes, back barrier flats, interdune swales, and washover fans
Geomorphic Component: Talf and / or low relief dip
Hillslope Profile Position: Footslope and backslope 
Parent Material: Sandy marine deposits and/or eolian sands
Slope: 0 to 2 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Acquango soils--do not have a seasonal high water table above 72 inches (183 centimeters); on higher dune positions
Askecksy soils--have quartz rock fragments, lack sulfidic materials in their substratum, and often are vegetated with mature hardwood or pine species.  Askecksy soils do not occur on back barrier island landforms.  They also lack soil pore water salinity.  
Brockatonorton soils--do not have a seasonal high water table above 20 inches (50 centimeters); on higher dune landform positions.  Brockatonorton soils may likely have "sodic" taxonomic subgroup properties like Fox Hill but currently are not recognized.   
Demas soils--formed on subaqueous washover-fan flat landforms directly adjacent to the barrier islands, these receive fresh sand deposits annually.  
Hooksan soils--do not have a seasonal high water table above 72 inches (183 centimeters); on higher dune positions.
Mantoloking soils--formed on subaqueous relict flood-tidal delta landforms in close proximity to the barrier island. 
Pawcatuck soils--formed in organic material 16 to 51 inches (40 to 130 centimeters) thick; on lower marsh positions that are tidally flooded twice daily. 
Purnell soils--formed in organic material 8 to 16 inches (20 to 40 centimeters); on lower marsh positions that are tidally flooded twice daily. 
Saltpond soils--formed on slightly lower landforms and have sulfidic materials within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface; tidally flooded twice daily.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Agricultural Drainage Class:  Poorly drained 
Internal Free Water Occurrence: Very shallow 0 to 10 inches (0 to 25 centimeters) and permanent endosaturation (present continuously) 
Index Surface Runoff:  Negligible 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class: High to very high

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Most areas are in natural vegetation and used for wildlife habitat. A few areas are cleared and used for recreational purposes such as camp sites.
Dominant Vegetation:  Vegetation consists primarily of low shrub type including: northern bayberry, Virginia creeper, white and red cedar, wax myrtle, green briar, poison ivy, and phragmites.  These areas have a wide diversity of vegetation and ecology. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: New Jersey, Maryland and possibly Delaware.  This series is of small extent. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 2014.  The name and concept were taken from Annie Rossi's PhD dissertation on Assateague Island National Seashore.  Fox Hill was the name for a relict inlet from the late 1800s which later became known as the Fox Hill Level on Assateague Island.  

REMARKS:  Fox Hill soils were previously mapped as Askecksy soils on the barrier islands in Maryland and Atsion tide flooded soils in New Jersey. 
The Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) may exceed 13 in most mineral horizons.  The sodium source is the salt water that frequently floods these soils on extreme tides and weather events. The adjacent estuary can also be a source of sodium as salt water persists in the lower portions of these soils.    

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are: 
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 78 inches (195 centimeters).
Lithologic Discontinuity--the zone from 33 to 78 inches (149 to 195 cm) (2Aseb horizon)
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 5 cm (2 inches) (O and A horizons) 
Sodic properties (SAR more than 13)--1 to 26 inches and 59 to 77 inches (2 to 66 centimeters and 149 to 195 centimeters) (the A, Cg1, Cg2, and 2Aseb horizons) 
Sulfidic materials--the zone from 26 to 78 inches (66 to 195 centimeters) (the Cseg and 2Aseg horizons).
