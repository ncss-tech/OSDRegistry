FRANKLIN SERIES

The Franklin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess and the underlying till. These soils are on interfluves, head slopes, and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at a depth between 0.3 and 1 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered and both perched and apparent and can occur on this soil based on the season and intensity of rainfall during a given period of time
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10 micrometers per second in the loess and 0.01 to 1.0 micrometers per second in the till

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bremer County, Iowa, 1965.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 83 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (Ap and E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 94 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons;
aquic moisture regime.

Some question exists as to whether the Franklin soils meet the saturation requirements for Aqualfs, but until further study is made it seems best to classify them as Aqualfs on the basis of morphology.  Some evidence indicates that that proportion of montmorillonite in the loess decreases from Iowa to Indiana and illite increases in proportion.

Classification to the fine-silty particle-size family is questionable.  Further study is needed to resolve this issue.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area. 

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.
