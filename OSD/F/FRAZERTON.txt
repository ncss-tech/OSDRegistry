FRAZERTON SERIES

the Frazerton series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in stratified alluvium on narrow flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Torrifluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Frazerton silty clay loam, on a 2 percent slope, under native grasses. (When described, the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 14 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium roots; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

    C1--14 to 27 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common medium and few coarse roots; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    C2--27 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam stratified with lenses of loam, clay loam, and clay; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few coarse roots; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Crook County, Wyoming; 1/4 mile south of the 1/16th corner marker, in the NE1/4 of SE1/4 sec. 10, T.55N., R.66W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate usually exceeds 60 inches but may occur at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent and consist of 1/2-to 3/4-inch angular sandstone. The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 15 inches thick. The control section is dominantly silty clay loam or silty clay and includes thin strata of loam, clay loam, and clay 4 to 8 inches thick. Salinity ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos.

The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10R, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam or clay loam.

The C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry. It is primarily stratified silty clay loam or silty clay but includes thin layers of loam, clay loam, and clay. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Colombo series in another family.  Colombo soils have loam or clay loam textures in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frazerton soils are on alluvial flood plains and low terraces. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. Elevation is 3,500 to 5,000 feet. The soils formed in noncalcareous alluvium. The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Haverson, Lohmiller, Stetter, and Twotop soils. Haverson, Lohmiller, Stetter, and Twotop soils have an ochric epipedon and are calcareous. Also, Haverson soils are fine-loamy; Twotop soils are very-fine textured, and have cracks that are 1 cm. wide at a depth of 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately slow permeability. Flooding is occasional and brief.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Frazerton soils are used for hay, livestock grazing, and for wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is primarily western wheatgrass and green needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Crook County, Wyoming. The series is inextensive.
