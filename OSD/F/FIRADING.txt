FIRADING SERIES

The Firading series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium from limestone. These soils are on convex hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderate. The mean annual precipitation is about 381 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Firading gravelly loam, rangeland - on a 13 percent north-facing slope at an elevation of 2,170 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

 Bw--10 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

 Bk--28 to 46 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular and common fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; few fine soft masses of lime; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

 Bkq1--46 to 71 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; silica pendants on undersides of 15 percent of the rock fragments; 45 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent (31 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

 Bkq2--71 to 99 cm ; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; silica pendants on undersides of 15 percent of the rock fragments; 45 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent (31 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (13 to 30 cm thick)

 R--99 cm; limestone bedrock.
