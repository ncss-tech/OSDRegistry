FILER SERIES

The Filer series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Haplic Glossudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Filer sandy loam, on a 15 percent slope in a formerly cultivated area now in grasses and shrubs at an elevation of about 184 meters (605 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated) 

    Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 in); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; about 1 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [8 to 23 cm (3 to 9 in) thick] 

    B/E--23 to 36 cm (9 to 14 in); about 60 percent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam (Bt), surrounding light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam (E), light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; about 1 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 in) thick] 

    Bt--36 to 79 cm (14 to 31 in); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common faint brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay films on surfaces along pores; about 1 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 in) thick] 

    C--79 to 203 cm (31 to 80 in); brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam; massive; firm; few patchy prominent pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) carbonate coatings on surfaces along pores; about 2 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Remus series. Remus soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 in). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Filer soils are on moraines and till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. The Filer soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 in). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Capac, Marlette, Parkhill, and Plainfield soils. The moderately well drained Marlette soils, somewhat poorly drained Capac soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Parkhill soils are in a drainage sequence with the Filer soils. The sandy excessively drained Plainfield soils are on adjacent landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for 
surface runoff is high or very high, depending upon slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are hardwood forest, hay, small grains or pasture. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 97, and 98 in central Michigan. The series is of large extent, with about 168,000 acres of the series mapped.
