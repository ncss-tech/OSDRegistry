FRITSLAND SERIES

The Fritsland series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Fritsland soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Humic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fritsland loam, woodland, on a 55 percent northwest-facing slope at an elevation of 1,400 feet.  (When described on August 2, 1985, the soil profile was dry throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, twigs, and woody materials.

    A--2 to 10 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, very fine, and medium roots; many fine and very fine irregular pores; 5 percent very fine and fine gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    BA--10 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; strong very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many fine and very fine continuous tubular pores; 5 percent very fine and fine gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--15 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, very fine and coarse roots; many fine and very fine continuous tubular pores; 10 percent very fine and fine gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2--22 to 34 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; moderately fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine continuous tubular pores; 10 percent very fine and fine gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw3--34 to 46 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; moderately fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, very fine, and medium roots; many fine and very fine continuous tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 26 to 40 inches)

    C--46 to 50 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, very fine, and medium roots; many fine and very fine continuous tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    R--50 inches; hard sedimentary bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Curry County, Oregon; located about 2,310 feet south and 2,310 feet east of the northwest corner of section 2, T. 40 S., R. 13 W.   (Latitude 42 degrees, 08 minutes, 44 seconds N.; Longitude 124 degree's, 12 minutes, 45 seconds W.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages between 20 and 35 percent clay.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The solum is 30 to 50 inches thick.  It is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.

The A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.

The BA, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons have value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, loam, or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel.

The Bw3 horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel.

The C horizon has value of 6 or 7 moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bravo, Huntdale (T); Kimper, Scaponia, and Whiteoak series.  Bravo soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Huntdale, Kimper, and Whiteoak soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Scaponia soils have more than 35 percent soft rock fragments in the Bw horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fritsland soils are on metastable side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation. Elevations are 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Averlande, Bravo, Cassiday, Colepoint, Crutchfield, Grouslous, Hazelcamp, and Skookumhouse soils.  Averlande, Bravo, Cassiday, Colepoint, Crutchfield, Hazelcamp, and Skookumhouse soils occur on broad ridgetops, benches, or side slopes of mountains.  Averlande, Hazelcamp, and Skookumhouse soils have argillic horizons.  In addition, Averlande soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock and are loamy-skeletal.  Bravo, Cassiday, Crutchfield, and Hazelcamp soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Colepoint soils have an umbric epipedon 14 to 20 inches thick.  Grouslous soils occur on steep side slopes of mountains, are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock, and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are mainly used for timber production, watershed, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is Douglas fir, tanoak, Pacific rhododendron, evergreen huckleberry, salal, western swordfern, cascade Oregongrape, common beargrass, and western brackenfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of southwestern Oregon; MLRA 1.  The series is not extensive.
