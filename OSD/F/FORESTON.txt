FORESTON SERIES

The Foreston series consists of moderately well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in marine sediment. These soils are on high ridges and slight rises within broad flat interstream divides of the Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

(0 to 10 inches thick)

E'--40 to 51 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) clean fine sand about 38 percent, light gray (10YR 7/1) clean sand about 31 percent, and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) coated sand about 30 percent. These colors occur as large pockets and vertical streaks with few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) soft masses of oxidized iron within the streaks and pockets; few lenses and streaks of white (10YR 8/1) clean sand grains; single grain; very friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick) 

B't--51 to 61 inches; mottled brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), gray (10YR 6/1) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly brittle in the brownish yellow part; few fine roots; common fine pores; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

Btg--61 to 85 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) fine sandy loam; common medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and few fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) soft masses of oxidized iron; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly acid, gradual wavy boundary. (0 to more than 20 inches thick) 

C--85 to 90 inches; mottled light gray (10YR 7/1) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand; massive; very friable; very strongly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Williamsburg County, South Carolina; 4.6 miles southeast on South Carolina Highway 512 from the intersection of U.S. Highway 52 in Cades, South Carolina; 0.1 mile southwest on South Carolina Secondary Highway 159; 0.2 mile south on field road; 33 feet northeast of road. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizon and very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Bt horizon. 

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. 

The E and E' horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redox features of higher chroma are present in some pedons. In some pedons the E' horizon is discontinuous and is mottled. It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. 

The upper Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Redox features in shades of red, yellow, and brown are present in some pedons and gray iron depletions are within 30 inches of the surface. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with less than 20 percent silt. Some pedons have a thin subhorizon that is sandy clay loam. Many pedons contain lenses and pockets of clean sand. Some pedons have a few nodules of plinthite. 

The B't horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8. It has few to many redox features in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray or it is mottled. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam. 

The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8 or it is mottled without a dominant matrix color. It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sandy, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay and in some pedons it is stratified with these textures.

COMPETING SERIES: (This section has not been reviewed; 4/8/98) These are the Dallardsville and Harleston series in the same family and the Dragston, Johns, Nansemond, Olanta, Pactolus, Rumford, Sequatche, and Whitwell series in similar families. Dallardsville soils have tongues of albic material in the B horizon. Harleston soils contain more than 20 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Dragston are aquults. Johns and Whitwell soils are fine loamy. Nansemond soils do not have secondary Bt horizons within 60 inches. Olanta, Rumford, and Sequatchie soils do not have mottles of chroma 2 or less within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon. Pactolus soils are sandy throughout. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Foreston soils are on nearly level slopes in the Coastal Plain. The soil formed in loamy marine sediments. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F., the average annual rainfall is 48 inches, and the frost-free season is about 228 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Autryville, Bonneau, Chisolm, Dothan, Fuquay, Goldsboro, Kalmia, Leon, Lynchburg, Lynn Haven, Norfolk, Ocilla, Paxville, Rains, Rutlege, and Wagram soils. The Autryville, Bonneau, Chisolm, Dothan, Fuquay, Norfolk, and Wagram soils are in slightly higher positions on the landscape and are better drained. In addition, these soils, except for Dothan and Norfolk, are arenic. They all have fine-loamy Bt horizons. The Goldsboro soils are in a similar position on the landscape, but they are fine-loamy. Lynchburg, Ocilla, Paxville and Rains soils are in slightly lower positions on the landscape and are more poorly drained and have fine-loamy Bt horizons. Leon, Lynn Haven and Rutlege soils are in the lowest position on the landscape, are more poorly drained, and are sandy throughout. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is slow. Permeability is moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of these soils have been cleared and are cropped to corn, cotton, tobacco, soybeans, and hay crops. Vegetation of forested areas include various species of pine with mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Plains of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. These soils are of moderate extent.
