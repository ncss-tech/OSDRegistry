FOSSILAKE SERIES

The Fossilake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in eolian material and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Fossilake soils are on depressions on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fossilake soils are on depressions on lakebeds. These soils formed in eolian material and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 1,306 to 1,326 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Salhouse and Thornlake soils. Salhouse soils have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, do not have endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface, and are on stable dunes. Thornlake soils are ashy, have cambic horizons, do not have endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface, and occur on lake terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; negligible surface runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table within 76 cm of the soil surface (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from April through June. Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory. The water table drops after June, but remains within about 122 cm of the soil surface year-round. These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from February through June with water less than 15 cm deep. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Fossilake soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential vegetation is mainly inland saltgrass, Carex sp., and Rush sp. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 1,100 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lake County (Northern Part), Oregon, 2006. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Anz1, Anz2, and Bn1 horizons). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 38 cm (Bn1 and Bn2 horizons). 
Buried cambic horizon - The zone from 79 to 168 cm (Bknb, BCb, and BCgb horizons). 
Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 76 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bknb, BCb, and BCgb horizons). 
Particle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cn horizon and parts of the Bn2 and Bknb horizons). 

Note: This series is the first Aquandic Halaquept recognized in the U.S.A. The 2nd edition of Soil Taxonomy (NRCS,1999) mentions that this subgroup is not known to occur in the United States.
