MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina; 2003. 

REMARKS: Fairview soils were previously mapped as Pacolet soils. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Fairview series as a mesic counterpart.  The 2008 revision is intended to limit the amount of mica allowed in the Fairview series.  Fairview is not intended to replace Madison soils in the mesic region.  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 9 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 9 to 24 inches (Bt horizon)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 9 to 29 inches (Bt & BC horizons). 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--0 to 60 inches
