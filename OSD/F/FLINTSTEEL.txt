Members of the typical drainage sequence (catena) include Big Iron and Watton.
Belding - are on slightly lower landscape positions and in the Alfic Epiaquods Subgroup
Big Iron - are on lower landscape positions and in the Aquic Glossudalfs Subgroup
Gull Point - are in drainageways and in the Typic Argiaquolls Subgroup
Loggerhead - are on similar landscape positions but are in the Alfic Oxyaquic Haplorthods Subgroup
Watton - are on steeper landscape positions and in the Haplic Glossudalfs Subgroup

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage - a perched seasonal zone of water saturation from 30 to 107 centimeters exists from November to May (moderately well drained)
Surface runoff - low to high depending on the slope  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - moderate (A, E, Bw, E/B, and B/E horizons), moderately slow (Bt horizon), and very slow (BCd and Cd horizons).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested.  The major species are sugar maple, red maple, green ash, quaking aspen, large tooth aspen, eastern hemlock, basswood, yellow birch, and balsam fir.  Some areas are used for pasture and hay production or are idle.
