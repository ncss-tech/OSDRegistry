FORDTRAN SERIES

The Fordtran series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are stream terraces on coastal plains.  Slopes are generally less than 2 percent, but range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 in), and mean annual air temperature is about degrees 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

Cieno, Dacosta, Edna, Nada and Telferner soils: have loamy surface layers less than 51 cm (20 in) thick and are on slightly lower positions. 
Garcitas soils: have gravelly or very gravelly surface layers and are above on knolls or low ridges.  
Lake Charles soils: are clayey throughout and are on slightly lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, low on 1 to 3 percent slopes and medium on 3 to 5 percent slopes.  Water perches on top of the argillic horizon for periods of 1 to 2 weeks following extended heavy rains.  During wet years planting may be delayed for short periods.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for native rangeland.  A small acreage is used for growing corn, grain sorghums, peanuts, melons, rice, and improved bermudagrass pastures.  Native vegetation is tall and midgrasses such as andropogons and paspalums.  Running live oak has encroached in places.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Prairies of Texas, mainly between the Colorado and Guadalupe Rivers. LRR T; MLRA- 150A (Gulf Coast Prairies) The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Calhoun County, Texas; 1972.

REMARKS:  The classification is changed from Arenic Albaqualfs to Aquic Arenic Hapludalfs based on the soil moisture study "ISCOM VIII, Classification and Management of Wet Soils, 1990."  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.  Mineralogy is also changed from mixed to montmorillonitic based on data from similar associated soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in)(A and E horizons)
Albic horizon: 41 to 71 cm (16 to 28 in)(E horizon, not required).
Argillic horizon: 71 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in)(Bt horizons)
Redoximorphic features: masses of iron accumulation in the Bt horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Highway Department Lab data on one pedon from Jackson County, TX (THD84TX-239-5).
