FRIONA SERIES

The Friona series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sediments from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F)

Arvana and Sharvana soils: do not have a mollic epipedon; in addition the Sharvana series has a petrocalcic horizon within 50 cm (20 in) of the soil surface. 
Kimberson soils: have a petrocalcic horizon within 50 cm (20 in) of the mineral soil surface; in addition the Kimberson series does not have an argillic horizon. 
Stegall soils: have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: moderately fine textured eolian deposits from the Blackwater 
Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.
Landform: nearly level to gently sloping plains.
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Lea series and the similar Arvana, Kimberson, Sharvana, and Stegall soils, and the Acuff, Bovina, Estacado, Olton, Pep, and Pullman soils.
Arvana, Kimberson, Lea, Sharvana, and Stegall soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Acuff, Bovina, Estacado, Olton, Pep, and Pullman soils: are on similar landscape positions and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability of the soil above the petrocalcic horizon is moderate and the permeability of the petrocalcic horizon is slow. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and low on slopes of 1 to 3 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for crop production. Principal crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax rangeland vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoates grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairieclover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland R077CY022TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is of moderate extent.
