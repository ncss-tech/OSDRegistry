FRYDEK SERIES

The Frydek series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock of the Beaumont Formation.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are in open depressions on coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (50 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, hyperthermic Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Austin County, Texas, 2019.

REMARKS:  
These soils were formerly included in a depressional phase of the Midland series.  The Midland soils occur in areas of higher rainfall and formed in deposits with higher silt content.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in) (A and E horizons)

Vertic feature: Cracks and/or wedge-shaped aggregates within the upper part of the argillic horizon.

Argillic horizon: 18 to 203 cm (7 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)
