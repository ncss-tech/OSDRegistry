FRELSBURG SERIES

The Frelsburg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey residuum of Tertiary Age derived from shale. These very gently to moderately sloping soils are on ridges of inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1066 mm (42 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.4 degrees C (69 degrees F).

Redoximorphic concentrations: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in). (A, Bk, Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3, Bkss4, and BCkss horizons)
Redoximorphic depletions: 91 to 132 cm (36 to 52 in). (Bkss2 horizons)
Identifiable secondary carbonates: 91 to 203 (36 to 80 in). (Bkss2, Bkss3, Bkss4, and BCkss)

Additional Comments: When dry, the soil has cracks up to 3 to 8 cm (1 to 3 in) wide at the surface and extends to a depth greater than 51 cm (20 in) or more. The cracks remain open for a period of 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years. Slickensides begin at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) below the surface and extend throughout the solum. The range includes 50 percent or more of the pedon. Colors are not included for the chimneys, or high value materials that extend to the surface on some microknolls, and the center of some microdepressions that are thicker and/or darker.  These conditions make up 5 to 25 percent of most pedons.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil was described and sampled from 9 m (30 ft) long pit. Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory: S77TX-477-5 (78PO102-78PO104). Texas Ag Exp. Station Laboratory: S83TX-285-02 (1931-1937) type location pedon.
