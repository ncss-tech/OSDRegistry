FLOREY SERIES

The Florey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks. These soils are on fan remnants and ridges. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Lincoln County, Wyoming, 2017. The series name is derived from a local landmark.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 200 cm (A, ABt, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 45 to 97 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
