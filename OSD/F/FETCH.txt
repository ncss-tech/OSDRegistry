FETCH SERIES

The Fetch series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from sandstone.  These soils are on pediments and have slopes of 3 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Lithic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fetch loamy fine sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 9 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    C--9 to 15 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    R--15 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Yavapai County, Arizona; located about 1,050 feet south and 1920 feet west of the NE corner of Section 19; T. 16 N., R. 4 E.; 34 degrees, 46 minutes, 22.3 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees, 57 minutes, 45.3 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 62 to 65 degrees F.

Rock fragments: Ranges from 0 to 5 percent; averages less than 5 percent in the control section

Clay content: 5 to 15 percent in the particle-size control section

Depth to bedrock: 10 to 15 inches

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4 through 6, dry or moist
Organic matter: 1 to 3 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 2 percent

C horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4 through 6, dry or moist
Organic matter: 0.5 to 1 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 2 to 5 percent
Texture: loamy fine sand, sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Toquerville (UT) and Schiefflin (AZ) series. Schiefflin soils are noneffervescent and have 10 to 25 percent rock fragments. Toquerville soils are dryer in the soil moisture control section, receiving on 8 to 11 inches of precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fetch soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  They formed in residuum from sandstone of the Verde Formation.  Elevations range from 3000 to 4000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bilgray and Gyberg soils.   Bilgray soils are very deep and have calcic horizons.  Gyberg soils are very deep and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists of mesquite, mimosa, indigo bush, threeawn, algerita and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Arizona.  Fetch soils are of small extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRAs 38 and 41.
