FURNISS SERIES

The Furniss series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Furniss soils are on flats, swales and drainageways on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackwell, Foolhen, Haydenfork, Retaw and Vensora soils. Blackwell soils are neutral to moderately acid and have stratified sandy material at 20 to 40 inches. Foolhen soils lack the sandy-skeletal material at 40 to 60 inches. Vensora soils have loamy-skeletal material at 40 to 60 inches. Haydenfork soils are slightly too moderately acid and lack the sandy-skeletal material 40 to 60 inches. Retaw soils are very poorly drained and have a peraquic moisture regime soils. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

fan remnants

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boquet, Tepete, Foxcreek, Zohner, Zufelt, and Zundell soils. Boquet soils are located in depressions on the same landforms as Furniss soils and have a histic epipedon. Tepete soils are found in adjacent swales and marshes and are histosols. Foxcreek soils can be on similar landforms but are also found on fan remnants and have a contrasting particle size class. Zohner, Zufelt and Zundell soils are found on adjacent mounds. Zohner and Zufelt belong to a calcic subgroup; Zundell soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.
