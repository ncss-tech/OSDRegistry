FRIO SERIES

The Frio series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Reconnaissance Survey of Southwest Texas; 1911.

REMARKS:  The control section averages 34.1 percent silicate clay and 35.6 percent total clay.  We classified this series in a fine family, and carbonate clay was not considered.

11/2014 RFG/SCP: Changed to tabular format and included metric values.  Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections. 

03/2021 CMR/SCP: Changed A3 and A4 horizons to Bk1 and Bk2 horizons based on the soil structure and secondary carbonates. Added calcic horizon to diagnostic horizons and features based on described carbonate masses and concretions.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 102 cm (0 to 40 in). (A1, A2, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons)

Calcic horizon: 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in). (Bk3 horizon)

Identifiable secondary calcium carbonate:  56 to 203 cm (22 to 80 in) (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)
