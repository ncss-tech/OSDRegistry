In some pedons the surface layer has a slightly fluid horizon, but it does not extend to a depth of 50 centimeters.
Some pedons have a peaty or mucky surface 5 to 20 centimeters thick.
Some pedons have 2C horizons below 152 centimeters (60 inches) that have the same color range as the A and C horizons, but individual strata are reddish, brownish or yellowish.

Ag horizon:
Hue-N or 10YR 
Value-3 to 7

Cg horizon: 
Hue-N or 10YR

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Other similar soils are the Barbary, Barrada, Gentilly, Karankawa, Levy, Scatlake, Tatlum, Tracosa, and Veston series.
Barbary, Barrada, Gentilly, Levy, Scatlake, and Tatlum soils: have n-values of more than 0.7 between 20 and 51 cm of the soil surface.
Karankawa soils: have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.
Tracosa soils: have a fine particle-size control section.
Veston soils: do not have a peraquic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Fine-silty estuarine deposits
Landscape: Barrier islands and coastal plain
Landform: Back-barrier marshes and tidal marshes
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 74 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 812 to 1194 millimeters (32 to 47 inches)

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Office

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brazoria County, Texas, 1978

REMARKS:
These soils were formerly classified as a miscellaneous land type, tidal flat, or were included with the Veston series. This soil has halic properties as described by J. A. Coover et al., in SSSA Proceedings, 1975.

Classification changed from Typic Haplaquents to Sodic Endoaquents on 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description. Further study of the series is needed to verify classification.

Typical pedon taxonomic features:
Manner of failure: Slighty fluid, 0 to 10 centimeters (Ag horizon)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 10 centimeters (Ag horizon)
Peraquic moisture regime: 0 to 200 centimeters (Ag and Cg horizons are permanently saturated)
Sodic properties: SAR above 13 (Ag and Cg horizons)
Taxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th Edition (2022)
