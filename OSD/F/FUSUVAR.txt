FUSUVAR SERIES

The Fusuvar series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Fusuvar soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, shallow Xeric Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fusuvar bouldery sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 20 percent gravel, 5 percent stones and 5 percent boulders.

    A1--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) bouldery sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent boulders; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; few very fine interstitial and common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw--18 to 36 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and common medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 33 cm thick)

    Cr--36 cm; weathered granitic rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mineral County, Nevada; about 3,000 feet north-northwest of the summit of Bald Mountain; USGS Reese River Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 47 minutes, 31 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 50 minutes 17 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.7919444 latitude, -118.8380556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter, and early spring, dry summer and fall, but moist intermittently due to convection storms; dry in all parts for at least 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice; xeric soil moisture regime
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Average summer soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness; 18 to 36 cm.
Depth to soft rock; 25 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Moderately acid through neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, over one-half of which are 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist.

Bw horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Fusulina series.  

Fusulina soils have less than 50 percent sand in control section, have shaly rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fusuvar soils are on mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 2,440 to 2,990 meters.  The climate is cool, continental with cold, moist winters and warm, relatively dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rockabin and Snopoc soils.  Rockabin soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm and more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Snopoc soils are over 150 cm to bedrock and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid or very rapid runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly curlleaf mountain mahogany, mountain big sagebrush, and oatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26 and 27.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.
