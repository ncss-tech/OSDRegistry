FARROT SERIES



The Farrot series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained

soils on foothills.  They formed in alluvium and residuum from

intermediate intrusive rocks.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes

are 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14

inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Farrot coarse sandy loam - rangeland; on a 24 percent

east-facing slope at 3,840 feet elevation.  When described on September

4, 1980, the Bt horizon was slightly moist.  (Colors are for dry soil

unless otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) coarse sandy loam,

very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure;

slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many

very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 7

inches thick)



    A2--4 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam,

very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky

structure parting to moderate medium granular; hard, friable, slightly

sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear

smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)



    Bt1--10 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown

(10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very

hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots;

common moderately thick clay films on ped faces; 5 percent fine

pebbles; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches

thick)



    Bt2--15 to 24 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay

loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular

blocky structure; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and slightly

plastic; few very fine roots; many moderately thick clay films on ped

faces; 10 percent fine pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy

boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)



    C--24 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly

coarse loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard,

very firm; very fine roots; few thin clay films; 40 percent pebbles;

mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual irregular boundary.  (1 to 7 inches

thick)



    R--30 inches; slightly weathered quartz diorite.



TYPE LOCATION:  Elmore County, Idaho; about 15 miles northwest of

Mountain Home; about 1,850 feet north and 1,900 feet east of the

southwest corner of section 7, T.1S., R.6E.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Colma, Dragoon, Duzel, Facey, Foehlin,

Glenrose, Immiant (T), Ladd, Lobitos, Los Gatos, Mehlhorn, Morical,

Taneum, Tieton, Tweedy, and Yaxon series.  Colma, Facey, Foehlin,

Glenrose, Ladd, Taneum, Tieton, and Yaxon soils are greater than 40

inches to bedrock.  Morical soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40

inches.  Dragoon soils have a loess mantle and a paralithic contact at

20 to 40 inches.  Duzel soils have a average annual soil temperature of

53 to 59 degrees F and a Bt with a subhorizon containing more than 35

percent rock fragments.  Lobitos soils have a average annual soil

temperature of 56 to 59 degrees F.  Los Gatos soils have a average

annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Immiant and Mehlhorn

soils contain less than 35 percent sands in the control section.

Tweedy soils have a Bt with 5 to 15 percent mica and have a paralithic

contact at 20 to 40 inches.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farrot soils are on foothills at elevations of

3,600 to 5,000 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium and residuum from

intermediate intrusive rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The average

annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches and the average annual

temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 120

days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Haw and the competing

Ladd series.  Haw soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.  Haw

soils are generally on south and west-facing slopes.  Ladd soils are on

positions similar to Farrot soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff;

moderately slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for rangeland.  The potential

natural plant community consists mainly of Xericensis big sagebrush,

antelope bitterbrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  The soils are moderately

extensive.

REMARKS:  Formerly classified as a fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Calcic

Argixerolls.  Farrot series is named after a creek.



Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:



Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 inches (the A and Bt horizons).



Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 24 inches (the Bt horizons).
