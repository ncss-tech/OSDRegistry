FERGUS SERIES 

The Fergus series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or till.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lincoln County, Wyoming, 1945. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0096, MT8133, MT0916.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap and Bt1 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 4 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Btk horizons); horizons of carbonate accumulation - the zone from 34 to 60 inches (Btk and Bk horizons); particle-size control section - the zone from 4 to 24 inches (the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).  Fergus soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
