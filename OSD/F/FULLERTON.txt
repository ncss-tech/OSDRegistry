REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon -- the zone from 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon -- the zone from 38 to 229 cm (15 to 90 inches) (Bt horizons)
Series control section -- the zone from 0 to 200 cm (0 to 79 inches)

This edit adopts the semitabular format, updates the typical pedon location, range in characteristics (BE and BA horizons), geographic setting, competing series (editorial change), and associated soils.
