FLUTEDROCK SERIES

The Flutedrock series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability. Flutedrock soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and eolian material. Flutedrock soils are on summits and shoulders of plateaus with bedrock controlled landscapes. Slopes are 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Lithic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Flutedrock fine sandy loam - mixed ponderosa pine, pinyon pine, and Rocky Mountain juniper woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)
 A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots throughout; many very fine vesicular pores; 2 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)
 C1--2 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; common very fine discontinuous tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)
 C2--8 to 14 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 2 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)
 R--14 inches; sandstone.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - Typically, the soil moisture control section (SMCS) is moist in all parts from January to April and intermittently moist in some part from July to December. Driest during May and June. The soil moisture regime is Typic Ustic.
Soil temperature: 47 to 50 degrees F.
Depth to sandstone: 4 to 20 inches
Clay content: 10 to 20 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles

A and C horizons 
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR 
Value:  3 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma: 2 through 6, dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loam, sandy clay loam

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Flutedrock soils occur on summits and shoulders of plateaus on sandstone bedrock controlled landscapes. Slopes are 1 to 60 percent. Average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 22 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F., and average frost-free period is about 110 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from  7,300 to 8,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atarque and Manuelito soils. The Atarque soils have argillic horizon and Manuelito soils are moderately deep to hard sandstone

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for wood products, livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is ponderosa pine, pinyon pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, Gambels oak, and Indian ricegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico. MLRA 35, LRR-D. The Flutedrock series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fort Defiance Area, Parts of Apache and Navajo Counties Arizona, and McKinley and San Juan Counties, New Mexico; 2008. The name Flutedrock is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)
Entisol feature - lack of diagnostic horizons
Lithic contact - the boundary at 14 inches (R horizon)
Reaction class - nonacid throughout
Soils classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010
