FURSHUR SERIES



The Furshur series consists of shallow to a duripan well drained soils

formed in residuum and slope alluvium from rhyolite.  Furshur soils are

on mountain sides and have slopes to 2 to 60 percent.  Permeability is

very slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and

average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Abruptic Durixeralfs

Durixeralfs.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Furshur very channery loam on a 5 percent slope at an

elevation of 5,440 feet in rangeland.  When described on May 23, 1983,

the soil was dry to 1 inch and moist below this depth.  (Colors are for

dry soil unless otherwise noted.)



    A--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very channery loam,

very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium, coarse and

very coarse platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and

slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very

fine, fine and medium tubular pores; about 40 percent channers; neutral

(pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)



    BA--2 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR

3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable,

sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine

tubular pores; few thin clay films lining pores and on faces of peds;

about 5 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt

wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)



    Bt--5 to 13 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish

brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; very hard,

firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine and few

medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; continuous thick clay

films lining pores and on faces of peds; 5 percent pebbles and 5

percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 12

inches thick)



    Btq--13 to 15 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) gravelly clay,

yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium angular blocky

structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common

very fine, fine and few medium roots; few fine tubular pores; many

moderately thick clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 15

percent pebble size pan fragments, 5 percent pebbles and 10 percent

cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches

thick)



    Bqkm--15 to 20 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silica and

calcium carbonate cemented hardpan with strong medium plates;

indurated; few very fine and fine roots as mats on top of this horizon;

slight effervescence (5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate); a continuous

laminar cap 1 to 3 mm thick is at 15 inches; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8).

(3 to 7 inches thick)



    R--20 inches; fractured layered rhyolitic bedrock with calcium

carbonate and silica in the fractures.



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho about 2 miles southeast of the

junction of highways 93 and 20; 1,700 feet west and 1,500 feet north of

the southeast corner of section 25, T. 1 S., R. 18 E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Depth to a duripan - 14 to 20 inches

Depth to bedrock - 18 to 24 inches

A horizon

Value - 4 or 5 dry

Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist



BA horizon

Chroma - 3 or 4 dry

Textures of the fine earth fraction - L, CL



Bt horizon

Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR

Value - 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist

Chroma - 4 through 6 moist

Textures - C and GR-C

Rock fragments - 5 to 20 percent

Clay content - 50 to 60 percent



Bqkm horizon

Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR

Value - 7 or 8 dry and 5 through 8 moist

Chroma - 1 through 4 dry and 2 through 4 moist

Reaction - mildly to moderately alkaline



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bigspring(T), Nicholflat(T), and the

Ponina series.  Bigspring soils have slow permeability and less than 5

percent rock fragments above the pan.  Nicholflat and Ponina soils do

not have bedrock under the duripan above 40 inches.  Ponina soils have

a frost-free period of less than 50 days.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Furshur soils are on mountain sides.  Slopes range

from 2 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 5,600 feet.  The

soil formed in residuum from rhyolite.  The annual precipitation is 12

to 14 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The

annual air temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free

season is 70 to 100 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Elksel, Hamtah,

Peeveywell, Starhope, and Winridge soils.  These soils all have mollic

epipedons.  Elksel, Hamtah, Starhope and Winridge soils are on mountain

sides.  Peeveywell soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff;

very slow permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is alkali

sagebrush, low sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Furshur soils are inextensive in south

central Idaho.
