RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st.  This soil has a xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C. The soils have a mesic soil temperature regime.


Soil reaction: very strongly acid to moderately acid.

Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent at 125 centimeters below the top of the argillic horizon.

Organic carbon is 12kg or more in the upper cubic meter of the mineral soil or the upper 15 cm of the argillic has 0.9 percent or more organic carbon.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckpeak, Centralia, and Highoaks soils.  The Buckpeak and Centralia soils have 7.5YR colors throughout the subsurface horizons.  Highoaks soils have an ochric epipedon.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains with slopes of 9 to 50 percent. They are in linear slope positions at elevations of 322 to 1206 meters (1056 to 3957 feet) in predominately south and southwest facing aspects. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The frost free period is about 240 to 280 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hawthorse and Rockus series. Hawthorse soils are fine with more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Rockus soils are loamy-skeletal with more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Hawthorse soils are found in concave slope positions generally below Flyat soils.  Rockus soils are found in convex slope positions generally above Flyat soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: well drained; high runoff; moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity. The water table is between 100 and 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) in January, February, and March. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is mostly used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation is bristly dogtail grass, blue wild rye, soft brome, and orchardgrass. Douglas-fir invades readily in the absence of fire.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The series is not extensive.
