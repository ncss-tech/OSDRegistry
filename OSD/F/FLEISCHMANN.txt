FLEISCHMANN SERIES

The Fleischmann series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Argidic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fleishmann gravelly clay loam--irrigated pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine through medium roots; many very fine through medium pores; l5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--10 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) heavy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine through medium roots; common fine through medium pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 23 cm thick)

    Bt2--25 to 50 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; very few roots; very few pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick)

    Bqm--50 to 109 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) strongly cemented duripan, with some weakly cemented strata; pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; very hard, very firm; few discontinuous indurated laminae; slightly effervescent in spots; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 64 cm thick)

    2C--109 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) highly variable semiconsolidated alluvium and weathered softly consolidated conglomerate with apparent texture of sandy loam to very gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, firm but very firm in about 25 percent of the area; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; approximately 2,500 feet south and 300 feet east of the northwest corner of section 32, T. 20 N., R. 20 E.; USGS Reno 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 33 minutes 24 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 46 minutes 12 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5566667 latitude, -119.7700000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry but are moist in the later winter or spring; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon: 20 to 30 cm thick.
Depth to the strongly cemented duripan: 50 to 76 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry.
Chroma: 2 or 3.  
Reaction: Commonly slightly acid or neutral but is medium acid in some pedons.

Btl horizon
Value: 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3.  
Structure: Angular blocky or prismatic. 
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Bt2 horizon
Hue: l0YR or 7.5YR.  
Value: 4 or 5 dry.
Chroma: 3 or 4. 
Structure: Weak through strong prismatic.  
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

2C horizon 
Other features: Unconformable variable alluvial deposits that have weakly silica-cemented lamellae in some pedons.  These deposits are often very gravelly.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fleischmann soils are on terraces at elevations of 1,310 to 1,520 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C; and the frost-free season is about 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Manogue, Orr, and Reno soils.  Manogue soils lack a mollic epipedon, an argillic horizon, and a duripan.  Orr soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and lack a duripan.  Reno soils lack a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well-drained; slow or medium runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pasture and urban development.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The series is of limited extent. MLRA 26.
