FERRIS SERIES

The Ferris series consists of deep to mudstone, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum weathered from calcareous mudstone. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils occur on backslopes of side slopes of ridges on dissected plains. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altoga, Ellis, Heiden, Houston Black, Lamar, and McLennan series.
Altoga, Lamar and McLennan soils: do not have slickensides and occur on similar positions
Ellis soils: occur on similar positions
Heiden soils: occur on similar less sloping positions
Houston Black soils: have moist value of 3.5 or less and chroma of 1.5 or less in the epipedon and occur on less sloping positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: Well. 
Permeability class: Very slow. 
Runoff: very high on slopes of 1 to 20 percent. 
Infiltration is rapid when the soil is dry and cracked, but very slow when the soil is wet.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and hay production. The native plant community is a fire-influenced mosaic of tallgrass and midgrass plant communities dominated by little bluestem, other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, switchgrass, vine mesquite, silver bluestem, tall dropseed, and Texas wintergrass. Improper grazing will result in a reduction of tall grass dominance and an increase in composition of mid-grasses, unpalatable forbs, and woody species. Most areas have been cultivated, eroded and are now in grass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East Central Texas; Land Resource Region J; MLRA 86A. The series is extensive.
