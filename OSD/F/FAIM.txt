FAIM SERIES

The Faim series consists of very deep, well drained that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum weathered from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuff.  Faim soils are on mountain slopes, valleys and plateaus and have slopes of 2 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches (762 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F (3.3 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Faim loam--rangeland.  (Color is for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.) Surface covered with 1 cm thick litter of leaves, twigs, and duff.

(14 to 17 inches (36 to 43 cm) thick)

    Bt1--14 to 33 inches (36 to 84 cm); brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; moderately thick continuous clay films; neutral (pH 7.1) gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 43 inches (38 to 109 cm) thick)

    Bt2--33 to 41 inches (84 to 104 cm); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; moderately thick continuous clay films; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches (0 to 38 cm) thick)

    2C--41 to 60 inches (104 to 152 cm); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.1).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bischoff (ID), Burnette (MT), Cochetopa (CO), Fulcher (CO), Grouseville (ID), Guero (T CO), Leemorris (OR), Lintim (T CO), Mancos (CO), Mayflower (CO), Paulson (WY), Perinos (T UT), Richens (UT), Runlett (CO), Skutum (UT), Winridge (ID) series.  Bischoff soils include hues redder than 7.5YR and formed in loess and silty alluvium.  Burnette, Fulcher, Grouseville (T), Mayflower and Paulson soils have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Guero soils have clay contents in the BC & C horizons of 35 to 50 percent and have 5YR hues in the Bt and C horizon.  Fulcher and Skutum soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Cochetopa soils contain dark colored magnetic mineral grains in the fine sand and silt fractions.  Lintim soils are formed in shale and have horizon fragments from shale lithology.  Mayflower soils are underlain by interbedded sandstone and shale at depths of 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm).  Leemorris, Mancos, Runlett and Winridge soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Richens soils have an E horizon.  Paulson and Perinos soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizons.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Faim soils are at elevations of 7,750 to 10,400 feet (2,362 to 3,170 m).  They occur on mountain slopes, valleys and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The climate is humid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 40 inches (559 to 1016 mm).  The mean annual air temperature is 33 to 40 degrees F (.6 to 4.4 degrees C).  The mean summer temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F (11.1 to 12.8 degrees C), and the freeze-free period ranges from 40 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Forsey, Parkay and Uinta soils.  Forsey soils have mollic epipedon less than 16 inches.  Parkay soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Uinta soils do not have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately slow and slow permeability; Ksat is moderately high or moderately low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland. The principal native vegetation is aspen, Columbia needlegrass, lupine, big sagebrush, Kentucky bluegrass and dryland sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Piute, Summit, Iron, Kane, Washington, Sevier and Wayne Counties, Utah; MLRA 47.  This soil is moderately extensive.
