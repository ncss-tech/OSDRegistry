FORTLOGAN SERIES

The Fortlogan series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or alluvium over residuum weathered from mudstone and siltstone.  These soils are on hills, fan remnants, and structural benches.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 320 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fortlogan loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(0 to 60 cm thick)

    C--115 to 135 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) paragravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 20 percent paragravel; finely disseminated carbonates; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. 

    Cr--135 to 152 cm; semi-consolidated mudstone derived from tertiary lake sediments.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Meagher County Area, Montana, 2011.  Fortlogan is named after the nearby decommissioned U.S. Army Fort.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 when mixed (A and part of Bt horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 16 to 35 cm (Bt horizon)
Calcic horizon - the zone from 35 to 115 cm (Bk and BCk horizons)
Paralithic contact - at 135 cm (Cr horizon)

Fortlogan soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
