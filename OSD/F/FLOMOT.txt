FLOMOT SERIES

The Flomot series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in highly calcareous loamy alluvium derived from the Oglala formation. These soils occur on nearly level to strongly sloping interfluves on dissected plains. Slopes are dominantly 3 to 8 percent but range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Calcidic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Flomot fine sandy loam - rangeland. 
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in), brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, few roots; few strongly cemented calcium carbonate concretions up to 1 cm. in diameter; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. Thickness is 13 to 31 cm (5 to 12 in)

  Btk1--15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 in), brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular and subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, few roots; few wormcasts; many soft bodies, weakly and strongly cemented concretions of calcium carbonate; about 45 percent calcium carbonate; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. Thickness is 13 to 31 cm (5 to 12 in)

  Btk2--38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 in), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, few wormcasts in upper part; few roots; about 50 percent by volume of calcium carbonate as soft bodies and weakly to strongly cemented concretions ranging to 3 cm. in diameter; calcareous; moderately alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary. Thickness is 38 to 89 cm (15 to 35 in)

  Btk3--102 to 191 cm (40 to 75 in), light red (2.5YR 6/6) loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable; common soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate; patchy clay films visible on ped surfaces; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family. These are Estacado, Mansker, Mobeetie, Posey, Tulia, and Veal series. 
Estacado soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have a mollic epipedon, and less than 40 percent calcium carbonate in the control section. 
Mansker soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have a mollic epipedon.
Posey soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and less than 40 percent calcium carbonate in the control section. Tulia soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Veal soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and do not have an argillic horizon. 
Mobeetie soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have an argillic horizon or calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: calcareous, loamy alluvium derived from the Ogallala Formation.
Landform: nearly level to strongly sloping interfluves on dissected plains.
Slope: dominantly 3 to 8 percent, but ranges from 0 to 12 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 15.0 to 17.2 degrees C (59 to 63 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 559 mm (20 to 22 in).
Frost-free period: 210 to 220 days.
Elevation: 487.7 to 792.5 (1,600 to 2,600 ft).
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index: 32 to 34.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Miles, Posey, and Tulia series.
Miles soils do not have calcic horizons within 76 cm (30 in), have mixed mineralogy, and more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Miles occurs on slightly higher side slope positions.  
Posey and Tulia soils occur on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is low on 1 to 5 percent slopes and medium on 5 to 12 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly rangeland, but some of the smoother areas are farmed.  Cotton and grain sorghums are the main crops.  Dominant vegetation on rangeland is mid and short grasses, mesquite, yucca, and sand sage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Plains, Western Part (MLRA 78B) of Texas, mainly below the High Plains escarpment.  The series is of moderate extent.
