FLYNN SERIES

The Flynn series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands.  These gently sloping and sloping soils formed from sediments high in glauconite.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Udic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Flynn fine sandy loam--on west facing 2 percent slope in rangeland.
                (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 8 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; common fine roots; few fine ironstone pebbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick)

     A2--8 to 12 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slighty hard, very friable; common fine roots; few fine ironstone pebbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

     Bt1--12 to 30 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; common fine pores; few fine ironstone pebbles 3 to 5 mm in diameter; few clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 30 inches thick)

     Bt2--30 to 55 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; common medium faint dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) stains; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; common fine pores; few ironstone pebbles 3 to 5 mm in diameter; common clay film on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (19 to 30 inches thick)

     Bt3--55 to 72 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam; red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; few clay films on surfaces of peds; few ironstone pebbles; few fragments of weathered glauconite; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (14 to 18 inches thick)

     BC--72 to 80 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) loam; red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few ironstone pebbles; few fragments of weathered glauconite; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Leon County, Texas; 1.8 miles north of Robbins on Texas Highway 39, 100 feet northeast in rangeland.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Ironstone pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout.  Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the Bt ranges from about 80 to 100 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, and 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 to 6.  Pedons that have chroma of 2 are less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have value of 3 in upper part of the Bt.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam with average clay content of 25 to 35 percent in the control section.  Fragments of brownish weathered glauconite range from 0 to about 10 percent by volume in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.

The BC horizon is reddish brown or red, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam or loam.   Weathered glauconite ranges from a few fragments to 25 percent by volume.  Horizontally oriented fragments of ironstone 1/2 inch to 3 inches thick and up to 18 inches across range from 0 to about 5 percent by volume.  Some pedons have a few streaks of uncoated sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.

The C horizon when encountered is reddish or brownish unconsolidated sediments that contain glauconitic sandstone with sandy or loamy materials.  Horizontally oriented fragments of ironstone 1/2 inch to 3 inches thick and up to 18 inches across range from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Bastsil and Duffau series in the same family and the Attoyac, Elrose, Gasil, Konsil, Margie, Ruston, Silawa, Silstid, and Woden series.  The Bastsil, Duffau, Gasil, and Silstid soils have hues of 5YR yellower in the Bt horizon.  Attoyac, Elrose, Ruston, and Woden soils are moist for longer periods of time; in addition Ruston soils have base saturation less than 35 percent, and Woden soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Konsil soils have base saturation less than 75 percent in all parts of the argillic horizon.  Margie soils have fine textured control sections.  Silawa soils decrease in clay by more than 20 percent within a depth of 60 inches and lack fragments of glauconite.  GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flynn soils are on gently sloping to sloping uplands.  Slope gradients are mainly 3 to 8 percent, but range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in deeply weathered sediments and colluvial material from the Weches Formation.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 52 to 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Gasil, Margie, and Silstid soils and the Jedd and Padina soils.  Gasil and Margie soils are on similar or slightly higher lying positions in the landscape.  Jedd soils have sola 20 to 40 inches thick and are on moderately steep sideslopes.  Padina and Silstid soils have thick sandy epipedons and are on higher lying landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the Flynn soils are used for pasture or range.  Some old cultivated fields have entrenched V-shaped gullies.  A few areas are cropped to corn, oats, peas or hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Texas Claypan area of East Central Texas. The series is of minor extent.
