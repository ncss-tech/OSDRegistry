FISHHOOK SERIES

The Fishhook series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on dissected till plains. They formed in 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm) of loess and the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Appleriver, Blair, Bunkum, Freeburg, Geff, Glenford, Keene, Muren, Reesville, Sugarvalley, Torox, and Xenia series. Appleriver soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Blair soils average more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches). Bunkum, Freeburg, Geff, Glenford, Muren, Reesville, Sugarvalley, Torox and Xenia soils average less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. In addition, Reesville and Torox soils contain carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Keene soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section that are mostly shale and siltstone. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fishhook soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep parts of dissected Illinoian and Pre-Illinoian till plains. Slope gradients are 2 to 18 percent. These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm) of loess and the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 13.9 degrees C (46 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches), frost free days range from 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 107 to 311 meters (350 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atlas, Blair, Coatsburg, Elco, Winfield, Fayette, Hickory, Keller, Keomah, Rozetta, and Ursa soils. The somewhat poorly drained Atlas and Coatsburg soils and the well drained Hickory and Ursa soils are downslope. Atlas and Coatsburg soils are shallower to the paleosol and Coatsburg soils have a mollic epipedon. Hickory soils average more than 15 percent sand in the particle-size control section and do not contain a paleosol. Ursa soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The somewhat poorly drained Blair soils are on similar landform positions but have the major part of their solum formed in water-worked sediments that lie above the till and beneath the Peoria loess. Elco soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landform positions. The moderately well drained Winfield, the well drained Rozetta and Fayette soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Keomah soils formed entirely in loess and are upslope on higher backslopes and shoulders or on crests of summits. The somewhat poorly drained Keller soils have a mollic epipedon, are in biosequence with Fishhook soils, and are on similar landform positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The seasonal high water table is 1.0 foot to 2.0 feet (30 to 61 cm) below the surface in spring during normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the till. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2 inches per hour) in the loess and slow (0.06 to 0.2 inches per hour) in the till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas are used for cultivated crops. Corn, soybeans, and small grain are the principal crops. Other areas are used for forage, hay, pasture, or woodland. Native vegetation is hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 108B, 113, 114b, 115a, AND 115b IN Western, northwestern, and southwestern Illinois. Extent is moderate. The type location is in MLRA 115C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stephenson County, Illinois, 1969. 

REMARKS: The 2Bt or 2Btg horizon of the Fishhook soils is the lower part of a modern solum superimposed upon a Sangamon paleosol in the Illinoian or Pre-Illinoian till. Many of the properties of those horizons are believed to be inherited from the paleosol. The variability of the properties is related to the geologic truncation of the paleosol before it was buried by loess, and to the extent of modern soil development in the old materials. Calcium and other bases have been replenished in some pedons after burial by loess through infiltration. It is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the modern solum from those of the paleosol in many pedons. Some pedons contain a thin layer of loamy pedisediment between the loess and the till. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 CM (6 inches) (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from about 15 CM (6 inches) to a depth of more than 208 CM (82 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6, 2Bt7, and 2Btg horizons); udic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime. 

This pedon was checked in the field by RDC 5/25/95 and adjustments were made in the description on depth of soil development, colors and redoximorphic features. CLL, RLT.
