FOSSILBUTTE SERIES

The Fossilbutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale. These soils occur on ridges, mesas and buttes. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Fossilbutte clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--7 to 15 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--15 to 79 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular; hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few fine roots throughout and few medium roots between peds; few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 70 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent angular sedimentary gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (45 to 85 cm thick)

    Btk1--79 to 99 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots throughout; few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 45 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent angular sedimentary gravel; 1 percent faint irregular carbonate masses on faces of peds and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 30 cm thick)

    Btk2--99 to 200 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine dendritic tubular pores; 20 percent faint clay films on vertical faces of peds; 5 percent angular sedimentary gravel; 7 percent prominent medium irregular carbonates masses in the matrix and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
