FULWIDER SERIES 

The Fulwider series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow to a duripan. These soils have formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from limestone with a component of loess on piedmont slopes and dissected fan terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Xeric Haplodurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Fulwider very gravelly silt loam-rangeland--on a 1 percent slope at 5,690 feet elevation. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on October 6, 1981, the soil was dry.) 

  A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common fine and medium, and few coarse tubular pores; slightly effervescent; 35 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick) 

  Bw--2 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium, and few coarse roots; common fine and medium, and few coarse tubular pores; strongly effervescent; 45 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick) 

  Bkq--12 to 19 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse roots; few medium and coarse tubular and interstitial pores; violently effervescent; 50 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

  2Bkqm--19 to 26 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) indurated lime and silica cemented hardpan. (5 to 13 inches) 

  2Bk--26 to 60 inches; variegated extremely gravelly sand with lime coating on underside of gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fulwider soils are on dissected piedmont slopes and fan terraces. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,600 feet. The soil formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from limestone. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 43 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. The frost-free season is 75 to 95 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Horseridge (T) soils. Horseridge soils are carbonatic and lack a duripan. These soils are on mountain sideslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very slow or slow runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Fulwider soils are used for rangeland. Native vegetation is low sagebrush, black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and prairie junegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Fulwider soils are of small extent in southeast Idaho.
