COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Belhaven, Cipre, Coree, Engelhard, Great Ditch, Machapunga and Newholland soils.
Belhaven soils--are in very poorly drained areas on flats, depressions, and flood plains in the Lower Coastal Plain; these soils formed in highly decomposed organic matter underlain by loamy marine deposits.
Cipre soils--are on permanently submerged wave-cut platforms and lake beds in the coastal plain; these soils formed in woody organic material underlain by sandy lacustrine deposits.
Coree soils--have buried A horizons placing them into the Thapto-humic subgroup and have finer textured materials.
Engelhard soils--are in poorly drained lake-wash rims along Lake Mattamuskeet, these soils formed in sandy lacustrine lake-wash deposits that contain a high content of very fine sand and are underlain by marine or fluvial deposits.  
Great Ditch soils--are on permanently submerged wave-cut platforms and lake terraces in the coastal plain, these soils formed in sandy lacustrine deposits.
Machapunga soils--are on permanently submerged wave-cut platforms, lake terraces, and lakebeds in the coastal plain, these soils formed in coarse-loamy and/or coarse-silty lacustrine deposits.
Newholland soils--are on very poorly drained broad upland flats and along the outer edges of pocosins or flood plains in the coastal plain; these soils formed in loamy marine and fluvial deposits. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class--Subaqueous (permanently submerged)
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity--Moderately high to high
Soil Moisture Regime--Peraquic

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Most areas are unvegetated and function minimally as littoral and limnic habitat. Recreational use is waterfowl, hunting, and observation; historically, there was extensive fishing and boating. There are no known commercial uses. 
Dominant Vegetation--Isolated clusters of Bald Cypress (Taxodium distichum) and historically wild celery (Vallisneria americana), sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinate), southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis), and redhead grass (Potamogton perfoliatus).  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Natural lakes and Carolina Bays in the coastal plain of North Carolina and South Carolina.
Region--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s)--153B
Extent--Small

REMARKS: 
Flyway is derived from the importance of Lake Mattamuskeet as a wintering location for waterfowl along the Atlantic Flyway.
