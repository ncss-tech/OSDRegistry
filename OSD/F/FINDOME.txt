FINDOME SERIES

The Findome series consists of shallow to densic material, well drained soils formed in glacial till derived from granitic rocks. Findome soils are on ground moraines of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, shallow Vitrixerandic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Findome very gravelly coarse sand on a south-facing (163 degree), 5 percent slope under subalpine perennial forbs at an elevation of 3313 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on July 8, 2015 the soil was dry to 3 cm.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Findome soils are on footslopes of ground moraines on basin floors. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in till derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 3215 to 3955 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 620 to 1430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -1 to 3 degrees C. The frost free season is 45 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Evolution and Forgotten soils. The Evolution soils are between 100 and 150 cm to a densic contact and are moderately well drained.  The Forgotten soils are on high-gradient drainageways and lack a densic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the densic layer is moderately low to moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is bottlebrush squirreltail, cushion buckwheat, frosted buckwheat, rosy buckwheat, June grass, and mountain parsley.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
