FONTANELLE SERIES

The Fontanelle series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on ephemeral oxbow lakes on floodplains and have slopes from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is 760 millimeters.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Fontanelle silty clay loam, with a slope of less than 1 percent on a nearly level flood plain - cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are:
Cass - are higher on the landscape and lack carbonates above 152 centimeters.
Inglewood - are higher on the landscape and have loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or sand surface textures.
Platte - are higher on the landscape and have sand and gravel at 25 to 50 centimeters.
Shell - are higher on the landscape and lack stratification.
Zook - are on higher or similar landscapes, lack stratification, and are in the fine particle-size class.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - Saturation at the surface to depths of 15 centimeters all year.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - Moderate
Surface Runoff - Very slow

USE AND VEGETATION: Some areas are cropped to corn and soybeans in some years, but many areas are not cropped. Native vegetation was tall, water tolerant prairie grasses and cottonwood and willow trees.

Physiographic Division  Interior Plains
Physiographic Province  Central Lowland
Physiographic Section  Dissected Till Plains
Land Resource Region  Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region (LRR M)
Major land Resource Area  Loess Uplands (MLRA 102C)
Extent  small; less than 200 acres on the flood plain of the Elkhorn River. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, Nebraska, 2003. Name comes from a nearby village.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon  0 to 18 centimeters (Ap horizon)
Strongly contrasting particle size classes between individual strata within the control section.
Buried soil at a depth of 122 to 152 centimeters (Ab horizon).

These soils were originally mapped as Rauville in the 1957 Washington County, Nebraska soil survey. The Rauville soils are frigid. These soils were also mapped as Gibbon Variant soil in Dodge County, Nebraska (MLRA 102C). These soils are highly variable and this classification may not be correct in every situation;  some pedons may be coarse-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal.
