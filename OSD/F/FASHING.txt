FASHING SERIES

The Fashing series consists of soils that are shallow to densic bedrock.  These well drained, slowly permeable, clayey soils are on gently sloping summits and shoulders of ridges.  They have formed in clayey alluvium over thick beds of interbedded mudstone, sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 736 mm (29 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, hyperthermic, shallow Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fashing clay in rangeland; elevation is 92 meters (301 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; many fine roots; few fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 5 to 20 cm [2 to 8 in].)

    A2--10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; common fine roots; few fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 15 to 25 cm [6 to 10 in].)

    AC--30 to 41 cm (12 to 16 in); light gray (10YR 7/1) clay, gray (10YR 6/1) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine angular blocky; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; few fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (Thickness is 8 to 30 cm [3 to 12 in].)

    2Cd--41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in); white (10YR 8/1) weakly cemented mudtone bedrock; massive; interbedded with thin layers of pale yellow sandstone; hard, brittle; moderately alkaline; can be dug with difficulty with an auger when moist.

Esseville: These soils are more than 50 cm (20 in) deep and have a gypsic horizon.
Harper: These soils have soil temperatures of less than 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and formed over limestone.
Monteola and Tordia: These soils are more than 50 cm (20 in) deep and have slickensides.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: clayey alluvium over thick beds of interbedded mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone bedrock of the Jackson Group
Landscape: inland, dissected coastal plain
Landform: summits and shoulders of low ridges
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual precipitation range: 660 to 787 mm (26 to 31 in)
Precipitation pattern: June through August and December through February are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May.
Mean annual temperature range: 21.1 to 23.3 degrees C (70 to 74 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 280 to 295 days
Elevation: 61.0 to 121.9 m (200 to 400 ft)
Thornthwaite P-E indices: 31 to 44.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Christine, Esseville, Picosa, Tordia, and Weigang series.
Christine: These soils are more than 100 cm (40 in) deep, have less clay, and occur on lower positions.
Esseville: These soils occur on slightly lower positions.
Picosa: These soils have a loamy particle-size control section and occur on similar positions.
Tordia: These soils occur on slightly lower elevations.
Weigang: These soils have a less clayey argillic horizon, formed over sandstone, and occur on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is high.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used as native rangeland and wildlife habitat.  A few scattered areas are used as improved pasture or are used for growing small grain for grazing.  The grasses are mainly red grama, threeawn, curly mesquitegrass, Hall's panicum, bristlegrass, and pink pappusgrass.  Woody plants include mesquite, blackbrush, twisted acacia, spiny hackberry, lotebush condalia, and pricklypear.
