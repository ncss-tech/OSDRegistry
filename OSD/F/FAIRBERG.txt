FAIRBERG SERIES

The Fairberg series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Calciustolls  

TYPICAL PEDON: Fairberg silt loam, in irrigated hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed organic material; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick) 

    A--2 to 11 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk--11 to 17 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 22 inches thick) 

    Bkg1--17 to 37 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Bkg2--37 to 52 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; common medium faint gray (10YR 5/1) redox reductions, moist; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bkg horizons is 15 to 35 inches thick) 

    2Bkg3--52 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) gravelly loam, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist seams of organic enriched material; common medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/2) redox depletions, moist; 20 percent gravel; disseminated lime; common medium and fine seams and masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
