FARSIDE SERIES

The Farside series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from gneiss, schist and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Farside loam, in cropland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 11 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; 5 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--11 to 14 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--14 to 31 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 6 to 25 inches).

    C--31 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 20 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1626. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 14 inches (A, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 11 to 31 inches; (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle size control section from 11 to 31 inches (Bt1, Bt2).  Farside soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.
