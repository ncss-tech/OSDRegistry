FERNPOINT SERIES

The Fernpoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks.  Fernpoint soils are on lake shore terraces and beach terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Ralls soils have C horizons with a fine earth fraction that is silt loam or clay loam.  Truax soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to a duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fernpoint soils are on lake shore terraces and beach terraces.  They formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite, and tuff.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 1,830 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Davey, Dugway, and Langston soils. Davey soils lack argillic horizons and are sandy. Dugway soils have fine natric horizons. Langston soils lack a Mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Fernpoint soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,600 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Washoe County, Nevada (North Part), 1995.  This series was first proposed in 1967.  The name is from a well known promontory located in northern Washoe County.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 18 to 43 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 122 to 152 cm (2Ck horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 18 to 43 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

The soil was formerly classified as Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aridic Calcic Argixerolls.
