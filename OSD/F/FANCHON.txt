FANCHON SERIES

The Fanchon series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands. They formed in silty sediments and the underlying colluvium and residuum. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping ridge tops and shoulder slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cottonbend, Egyptgrove, McClung, Nolichucky, Taterhill, Topazmill, Trimble, and Wyrick series. Cottonbend, McClung, and Trimble soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Egyptgrove soils have a Btd horizon.  Nolichucky soils have more sand in the particle size control section. Taterhill soils do not have a 3Bt horizon. Topazmill soils have more than 30 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Wyrick soils typically have more rock fragments in the 2Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fanchon soils are on ridge tops and shoulder slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in silty sediments derived mainly from loess and the underlying colluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks. Elevations are commonly 900 to 1,200 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 45 inches.
   
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Alred, Bendavis, Poynor, Scholten and Tonti soils. Alred and Poynor soils have a loamy-skeletal over clayey particle-size class and are on side slopes. Bendavis soils are moderately deep and on sides slopes. Scholten and Tonti soils have fragipans. Scholten soils are skeletal and on shoulder slopes. Tonti soils are adjacent to Fanchon soils on ridge tops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is low to medium. Permeability is moderate, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for pasture and timber. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks Highland region (MLRA 116A) of Missouri and possibly Arkansas. This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ozark County, Missouri soil survey; 2003. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:

1)  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 5 inches (A horizon).
2)  Argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 80 inches (Bt, 2Bt and 3Bt horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil is being mapped predominantly in the Jefferson City formation (Ordivician age) in Missouri.

Fanchon soils were previously included in the Tonti series in mapping.
