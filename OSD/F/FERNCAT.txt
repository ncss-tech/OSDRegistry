FERNCAT SERIES

The Ferncat series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone.  Ferncat soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1285 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ferncat soils are on mountain summits and gentle to steep slopes. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 25 to 520 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone with minor amounts of siltstone and sandstone. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1040 to 1530 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 250 to 3 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearcat, Darkprairie, Oilcreek, and Sleepyhollow soils.  Bearcat and Darkprairie soils have a difference between mean annual soil temperatures of more than 6 degrees centigrade.  Oilcreek and Sleepyhollow soils lack redoximorphic features within 100 centimeters.  Bearcat and Darkprairie soils are on gently sloping open prairies.  Oilcreek and Sleepyhollow soils are on linear to convex positions on ridges and mountain slopes under mixed conifer and hardwood forest. 
 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, medium to very high runoff, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity. The soil has a high water table between 50 and 100 centimeters January through April.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: 
This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Natural vegetation includes redwood, Douglas-fir, Sitka spruce, grand fir, tanoak, red alder, Pacific madrone, California hazel, California huckleberry, salal, thimbleberry, red huckleberry, and western swordfern.

 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
