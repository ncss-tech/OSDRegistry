FINCHFORD SERIES

The Finchford series consist of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in coarse textured alluvium or glacial outwash. Finchford soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys and valley trains on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 870 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Entic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Finchford loamy sand, on a 2 percent slope, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure parting to single grain; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; about 4 percent fine gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 A1--20 to 46 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; very friable; common very fine roots; about 8 percent fine gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 A2--46 to 76 centimeters; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) sand, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; single grain; loose; about 12 percent fine gravel; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 85 centimeters.)

 C1--76 to 140 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 20 percent fine gravel; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 C2--140 to 178 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 10 percent fine gravel; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 C3--178 to 200 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 16 percent fine gravel, moderately acid.
