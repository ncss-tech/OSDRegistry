FELTONIA SERIES

The Feltonia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with loess influence. Feltonia soils formed in fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406[cr1] mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Feltonia loam on a fan remnant with 1 percent slope at an elevation of 1838 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(Combined thickness of the A horizons is 20 to 58 cm)

 Bt1--30 to 51 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky then to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few fine and many very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on vertical faces of peds and  on surfaces along pores; very few skeletans; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 0 to 55 cm)

 Bk1--69 to 91 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common fine calcium carbonate threads; strongly effervescent (19 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

 Bk2--91 to 124 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common fine calcium carbonate threads; 40 percent gravel; strongly effervescent (35 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 25 to 96 cm)

 2Bk3--124 to 152 cm; very gravelly loamy sand; single grain; loose; calcium carbonate coats on bottoms of rock fragments; 45 percent gravel; slightly effervescent (12 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).
