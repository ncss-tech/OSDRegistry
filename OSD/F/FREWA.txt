FREWA SERIES

The Frewa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Frewa soils are on fan skirts.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Haploduridic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Frewa loamy fine sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 3 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

     A2--5 to 20 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sandy, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

     Bw--20 to 46 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 4 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to  30 cm thick)

     Bq--46 to 84 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 20 percent durinodes; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 38 cm thick)

     Bqk1--84 to 112 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; continuously weakly cemented; many fine irregularly shaped lime carbonate filaments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 46 cm thick)

     Bqk2--112 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; continuously weakly cemented; common fine irregularly shaped lime carbonate filaments; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Pershing County.  Nevada; approximately 6 miles east of Mill City in Dun Glen Flat; about 50 feet north of the southwest corner of section 33, T.  33 N., R. 36 E.; USGS Dun Glen 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 40 minutes 59 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 53 minutes 37 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.6830556 latitude, -117.9469444 longitude.NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in the winter and spring, dry late June through October.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to continuous weak silica cementation: 38 to 84 cm.
Depth to carbonates: 38 to 84 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  5 to 10 percent.  
Rock fragments:  Up to 25 percent.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  When mixed, the upper 18 cm averages 6 dry and 4 moist.  
Chroma:  2 or 3.  
Structure:  Platy, granular or single grained.  
Consistence:  Nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic.  
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bw horizon
Value:  3 or 4 moist.  
Texture:  Loamy fine sandy or loamy sand.  
Clay content:  5 to 10 percent.  
Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent, mainly gravel.  
Structure:  Subangular blocky or platy.  
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bq and Bqk horizons
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.  
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  
Texture:  Loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  
Clay content:  5 to 10 percent.  
Rock fragments:  Up to 25 percent gravel in any one subhorizons.  Effervescence:  The Bqk horizons are strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.  
Cementation: Continuously weakly silica cemented in some part above 84 cm, but subhorizons may contain 15 to 30 percent 10 to 35 mm durinodes or be 20 to 70 percent discontinuously weakly silica cemented.  
Other features:  These soils are slightly or moderately salt or sodium affected below 84 to 112 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Ormsby series. Ormsby soils are moderately well drained and have average textures of gravelly coarse sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frewa soils are on fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Enko and Gwena series.  Enko soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Gwena soils have an indurated duripan at a depth of 36 to 50 cm and a natric horizon with 20 to 35 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Sandberg bluegrass and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24.
