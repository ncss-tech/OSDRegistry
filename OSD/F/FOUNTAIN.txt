FOUNTAIN SERIES

The Fountain series consists of poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in silty deposits of late Pleistocene age.  These soils are on stream terraces with low relief.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Glossaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fountain silt loam--cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap1--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (2.5YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; strong fine granular structure; friable; hard when dry; many fine roots; many fine pores; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

   Ap2--6 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; strong medium platy structure; friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

   B&A--10 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam; many coarse faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and many coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; vertical tongues up to 4 inches wide of gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam makes up about 20 percent of horizon and extends to 30 inches; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; few soft brown and black masses; mildly alkaline; clear irregular boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

   B2tg--20 to 45 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam; common medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and many coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) mottles; weak medium prismatic structure that parts into moderate medium subangular blocky; few fine roots; many fine pores; friable; thin discontinuous light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay films on surfaces of prisms; tongues of dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam extend to 30 inches; few carbonate concretions of 1/2 inch to 2 inches in diameter at 30 to 45 inches; mildly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

   B3--45 to 51 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt loam; many medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) mottles; weak medium prismatic structure; friable; few fine roots; many fine pores; few brown and black concretions; mildly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

   Cg--51 to 75 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam; common fine and medium faint gray (10YR 5/1) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and few coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; friable; mildly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana; Perkins Road Farm of Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station; 7/10 mile west-southwest of intersection of Perkins Road and Essen Lane; sec. 42, T. 7 S., R. 1 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 40 to 60 inches.

The Ap1 or A1 horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, or silty clay loam.  The Ap2 or A2 horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam.  Thickness of the A horizon is 6 to 15 inches.  It ranges from medium acid through mildly alkaline.  Tongues of the A horizon, 1 to 6 inches wide, extends to a depth of 20 to 40 inches below the surface.

The Bt horizon is gray (10YR 5/1; 5Y 5/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam or silty clay loam.  Mottles are in shades of gray and brown.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and 3 to 10 percent sand that is dominantly very fine sand.  The Bt horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Most pedons have carbonate concretions within the middle or lower Bt horizon.

The B3 horizon is in shades of brown or gray with brownish or grayish mottles.  It is silt loam, and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.

The C horizon is in shades of brown or gray with brownish or grayish mottles.  It is silt loam and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Basile, Calhoun, and Frost series in the same family and the Amagon, Bonn, Caddo, Deerford, Essen, Foley, Guyton, McCune, Patoutville, Routon, and Verdun series. Amagon, Essen, Patoutville, and Routon soils lack tonguing of the A2 horizon into the Bt horizon.  Also, Essen, McCune, and Patoutville soils are better drained and have higher chroma colors in the control section.  Basile and Guyton soils have more than 10 percent sand.  Bonn, Deerford, Foley, and Verdun soils have natric horizons.  Caddo soils are acid and have more than 10 percent sand in the control section.  Calhoun, Frost, Guyton, and Routon soils are more acid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fountain soils are on terraces with low relief with slope gradients of one percent or less.  The soil formed in late Pleistocene silty deposits that have many characteristics of loess.  Most delineations are small.  At the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 67.5 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 54.5 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bonn, Calhoun, Essen, and Lafe series and the Fred and Olivier series. Fred and Olivier soils are better drained and have higher chroma colors in the control sections.  In addition, Olivier soils have fragipans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  Apparent water table is at the surface to 1.5 feet below the surface December through April.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly pasture of mixed pine and hardwood timber.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and possibly Mississippi.  The acreage is small or moderate
