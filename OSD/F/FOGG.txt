COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fogg soils are on moraines and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The Fogg soils formed in sandy and loamy glacial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are the somewhat excessively drained Kaleva soils and the somewhat excessively drained Benzonia soils on similar landscape position. Kaleva soils are sandy throughout and Benzonia soils have lamellae of sand or loamy sand but do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is very low to medium, depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part is in forestland. Forest vegetation consists chiefly of sugar maple, American beech, black cherry, American basswood, and bigtooth aspen. Some areas are in cropland, pasture, or idle cropland. Principal crops are apples, small grains, hay and potatoes. Small areas of Christmas tree plantations are also present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
