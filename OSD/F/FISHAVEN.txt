FISHAVEN SERIES

The Fishaven series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium and residuum dominantly from limestone.  They are on hills.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 8 to 20 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Typic Calcixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Fishaven gravelly loam, rangeland; on a 17 percent slope at 6,260 feet elevation.  When described on July 7, 1989 the soil was moist to 6 inches and dry below. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent (18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 7 inches thick)

    BA--10 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk--16 to 22 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime in the soil matrix and rock fragments are coated on all sides with lime; 20 percent gravel (dominantly a marl like rock); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    C--22 to 27 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (>65 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); disseminated lime; 40 percent gravel (dominantly of a marl like rock); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

    R--27 inches; limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Dutchcanyon (T) series.  Dutchcanyon soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fishaven soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 8 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 5,850 to 6,600 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium and residuum from limestone.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches, average annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F., the frost free period is 70 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clegg, Dutchcanyon (T), Frenchollow (T) and Yeates Hollow soils.  All of these soils are very deep.  Clegg soils are on east and north-facing hillsides on a lower landscape position than Fishaven.  Dutchcanyon soils are formed in similar materials to Fishaven and are on similar positions.  Frenchollow soils are generally on north and east-facing hillsides.  Yeates Hollow soils are on hillsides, mountainsides and fan terraces, generally on higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Fishaven soils are used for building sites, nonirrigated cropland and rangeland.  Typical crops consist of small grains.  The potential native vegetation is Mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008.  The name is taken from a nearby community.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 16 inches (the A1, A2 and BA horizons).

Calcic horizon - the zone from 16 to 22 inches (the Bk horizon)

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 inches to the lithic contact at 27 inches (the BA, Bk and C horizons).

Carbonatic mineralogy - the particle-size control section averages about 50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.

Calcixeroll feature - the soil is calcareous in all parts above the Bk horizon.
