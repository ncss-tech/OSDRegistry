COMPETING SERIES: These are the Donnel and Gestrin series. Donnel and Gestrin soils lack bedrock between 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly colluvium and/or till
Elevation: 2,231 to 5,295 feet (680 to 1,614 m)
Slope: 18 to 75 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 52 inches (700 to 1,310 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Frostcircle, Minya, and Ogive soils. Frostcircle soils are poorly drained, shallow to deep to permafrost, and occur on mountains and till plains. Minya soils are well drained, shallow, and occur on mountains. Ogive soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is green alder/red current/bluejoint scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
