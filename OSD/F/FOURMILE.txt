FOURMILE SERIES

The Fourmile series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash, and slope alluvium derived mainly from granite.  Fourmile soils are on remnant pediments, stream terraces, alluvial fans, outwash plains, and eskers.  These soils have slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fourmile gravelly coarse sandy loam, in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

     A1--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 15 percent fine and very fine angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  

     A2--5 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 59 percent fine and very fine angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of the A horizons: 7 to 10 inches thick)

     Bt1--9 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam,  brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 59 percent fine and very fine angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  

     Bt2--20 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam,  brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores;  59 percent fine and very fine angular gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bt horizons: 10 to 30 inches thick)

     2C--24 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; single grain; soft, loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; ; 55 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).
