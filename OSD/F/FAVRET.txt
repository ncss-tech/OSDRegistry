FAVRET SERIES

The Favret series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from siliceous and volcanic rocks.  They are on mountain side slopes and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Favret very gravelly loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine, common fine and medium vesicular pores; 35 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles, 2 percent cobbles; few thin clay films on peds, mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2--9 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles, 2 percent cobbles; common thin clay films on peds and in pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt2--13 to 35 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine, common fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; l5 percent pebbles, 2 percent cobbles; common thin clay films on peds and in pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (17 to 25 inches thick)

    R--35 inches; argillite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pershing County, Nevada, 2,500 feet south, 450 feet west of the northeast corner of section 18, T. 28 N., R. 39 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Moist in winter and spring, dry from July through October.

Soil temperature:  44 to 46 degrees F.

Solum thickness:  17 to 35 inches.

Depth to bedrock:  20 to 40 inches.


Control section: Rock fragments:  10 to 30 percent, mainly pebbles.

Reaction:  Neutral to moderately alkaline.

Other features:  Some pedons contain lime in the lower solum. C horizons are present in some pedons.


A horizon Chroma: 2 or 3 moist.


Bt horizon Value:  5 or 6 dry.

Fine earth texture:  Loam or clay loam.

Clay content:  18 to 35 percent.

Fine earth texture:  Loam, clay loam.

Rock fragments:  10 to 30 percent, weighted average,  mainly pebbles.

Consistence:  Soft or slightly hard, dry; friable or very friable, moist.

Other features:  Some pedons have thin subhorizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Credo, Menan, and Pedoli series.  The Credo, Menan, and Podoli soils are more than 60 inches deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Favret soils are on mountain side slopes, they formed in residuum from siliceous and volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 5,000 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches; the mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atlow, Havindon and Hoot soils.  Atlow and Hoot soils are less than 20 inches deep. Havingdon soils have a clayey-skeletal control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is dominantly black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  Thse soils are of small extent.
