FARWAY SERIES

The Farway series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and reworked glacial drift on valley walls, debris aprons, Pleistocene terraces, and Pleistocene moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent on terraces and 15 to 65 percent on valley walls, debris aprons, and Pleistocene moraines.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, glassy over isotic, frigid Typic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Farway gravelly ashy sandy loam, on a northeast facing slope of 40 percent at an elevation 1000 meters elevation under Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  All textures are apparent field textures.)

    Oe--0 to 3 cm; moderately decomposed needles and twigs; abrupt smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brannon, Capoose, Crackler, Elbowlake, Kellerbutte, Kootenai, Natapoc, Nevine, Olot, Rouen, Saska, and Vingulch series.  Brannon soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice, and are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact. Saska soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Capoose, Olot, Rouen, and Vingulch soils are 50 to 102 cm to bedrock.  Crackler soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice and lack parent material of glacial origin.  Elbowlake soils are ashy silt loam in the upper part of the particle-size control section and are moderately deep to a densic contact with glacial till.  Kellerbutte soils have angular to very angular rock fragments and lack parent material of glacial origin.  Kootenai soils are coarse sand or loamy coarse sand in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Natapoc and Nevine soils are moderately deep to a densic contact with glacial till. 
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farway soils are on valley wall, debris apron, Pleistocene moraine, and Pleistocene terrace landforms at elevations of 500 to 1,500 meters.  Slope range from 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and reworked glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 800 millimeters. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 9 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buckrock, Gatewall, Goode (T), and Veridge soils. Buckrock soils are on open shoulders and ridges and are mesic.  Gatewall soils are on backslopes and are cryic.  Goode soils are on the more active portions of all the same landforms and have a mantle with andic soil properties that is 18 to 35 centimeters thick. The Veridge soils are on backslopes and shoulders and have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 102 centimeters.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, wildlife habitat and livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine with an understory of pinegrass, birchleaf spirea, silky lupine, mountainlover, kinnikinnick, pachistima, serviceberryand Scouler willow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Washington on the eastern slopes of the North Cascade Mountains.  This series is of small extent.
