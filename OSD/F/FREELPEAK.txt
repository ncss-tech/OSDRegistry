FREELPEAK SERIES


The Freelpeak series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite.  The Freelpeak soils are on the summit and shoulders of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1016 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Freelpeak gravel on a north facing (4 degree), 50 percent slope at an elevation of 3,231 meters. When described on 09/19/2002 the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.  The soil surface is covered with 95 percent fragments consisting of 80 percent and 15 percent cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alflack, Canlodore, Castlepeak, Chena, Cryomont, Dagget, Eklutna, Graylock, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Perfecto, Ragamuffin, Sofgran, Stecum, Studebaker, and Whittell soils. The Canlodore, Castlepeak, Chena, Cryomont, Eklutna, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Perfecto, Sofgran, and Studebaker soils are greater than 150 centimeters deep to bedrock. Dagget and Graylock soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to bedrock. Of the three soils with bedrock at 50 to 100 centimeters Alflack is formed in sandstone with coarse fragments consisting of channers and flagstones. Stecum soils are formed in micaceous granite and gneiss on foothills with a soil temperature of 5.5 to 8 degrees centigrade. Whittell soils have an Oi horizon and lack a C horizon on the surface. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Freelpeak soils are on summits and shoulders of mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 80 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite. Elevation is 2860 to 3320 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cool, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 1016 to 1397 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 1 to 3 degrees C. The frost free season is less than 30 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Windyridge, Jobsis and Whittell soils.  The Windyridge and Jobsis soils are less than 50 centimeters to bedrock.  Whittell is typically lower in elevation on less convex slopes with more vegetation.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained, rapid permeability, high runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife and recreation. Vegetation is alpine fell field with alpine forbs and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are of minor extent in California in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains.
