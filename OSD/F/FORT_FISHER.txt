GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Bohicket, Carteret, Fort Caswell, Kureb, Molasses Creek, Newhan, Prices Creek, Showboat, and Sunny Point soils.
Bohicket soils--are on broad level tidal marsh flats bordering the Atlantic Ocean and formed in silty and clayey marine sediments.
Carteret soils--are on back-barrier island tidal marshes of the Atlantic Coast and formed in sandy marine deposits.
Fort Caswell soils--are on high-energy submerged wave-cut platforms and shoals formed in sandy estuarine deposits throughout.
Kureb soils--are on gently sloping to moderately steep soils on Coastal Plain uplands and side slopes along streams and bay and formed in marine, eolian, or fluvial sands and have spodic horizon characteristics.
Molasses Creek soils--are in estuarine tidal streams and barrier coves formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits.
Newhan soils--are on gently undulating dunes commonly near beaches and waterways, do not have water at or near the soil surface, and formed in sand and shelly eolian deposits along the Atlantic Coast
Prices Creek soils--are in estuarine tidal streams and formed in fine-loamy estuarine deposits.
Showboat soils--are in mainland coves and estuarine tidal streams formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and contain 40 centimeters of buried organic soil material within 200 centimeters of the soil surface. 
Sunny Point soils--are on lower energy shoals and mainland coves and formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and contain at least 15 centimeters of sulfidic materials within the top 50 centimeters of the soil.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming. Some areas are actively harvested for crabs. 
Vegetation--Limited stands of shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), and Saltwater Eelgrass (Zostera marina) exist in lower energy areas with low turbidity that allow for establishment.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Coastal plain estuaries in North Carolina
Region--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
Extent--Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brunswick County, North Carolina, 2024

REMARKS: 
Fort Fisher is derived from the remnants of the fort constructed on the eastern side of the Cape Fear River in 1862 to protect the Port of Wilmington, often referred to as the Gibraltar of the South. The fort was captured by Union forces on January 12, 1865. 

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022)--

Endosaturation--0 to 195 centimeters (0 to 77 inches)
Fluviwassents Great Group--An organic carbon content of 0.2 percent or more at 125 centimeters or an irregular decrease in organic carbon at a depth of 25 to 125 centimeters. 
Peraquic feature--Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface.
Lithologic discontinuity--60 to 195 centimeters (24 to 77 inches)
n-value > 0.7--60 to 195 centimeters (24 to 77 inches)
