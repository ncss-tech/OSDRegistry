FORELEFT SERIES

The Foreleft series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Foreleft soils are on sedimentary plains, fan remnants, hills, ridges, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Custer County, Montana; 1995.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1471.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 4 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 4 to 12 inches that is the particle-size control section (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation from 21 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); Foreleft soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
