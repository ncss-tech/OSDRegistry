FILLEY SERIES

The Filley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash deposits that have been reworked by wind.  Filley soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 6 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F. at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Filley fine sandy loam with a convex slope of 8 percent - cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 6 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine and medium granular structure; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; slightly hard, very friable; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A1--6 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; slightly hard, very friable; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 10 to 24 inches.)

  Bw--12 to 23 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; soft, very friable; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick.)

  BC--23 to 30 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry; very weak medium subangluar blocky structure; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; soft very friable; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 14 inches thick.)

  C1--30 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine sand; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; single grain; few fine roots throughout; loose; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

  C2--60 to 80 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sand; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; single grain; loose; 1 percent by volume gravel; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Lancaster County, Nebraska; about .5 mile west and 1 mile south of Denton; then 1700 feet south and 500 feet west of northeast corner Sec. 28. T.9 N., R. 5 E. USGS Denton topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees, 43 minutes, 50 seconds N. and long. 96 degrees, 51 minutes, 20 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is Udic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 52 to 55 degrees F
Depth to cambic horizon: 10 to 24 inches
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 10 to 24 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
Sand content: 52 to 85 percent

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3, moist or dry
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: Fine sandy loam or loam
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
Reaction: Moderately acid to neutral 

Bw horizon:
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 3 to 5, moist or dry
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: Sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
Reaction: Slightly acid to strongly acid 

BC and C horizons:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 7, moist or dry
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: Loam find sand, loamy sand, or fine sand
Clay content: 4 to 10 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent by volume gravel in lower C horizon
Reaction: Slightly acid to moderately acid

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dickinson, Ridgeport, and Zenor soils. 
Dickinson soils are substantially more moist in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice, and may have a few redox features of 3 or higher chroma in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon. 
Flager soils have gravel within the solum and C horizon to a depth of at least 40 inches and commonly contain more coarse sand within the 10 to 40 inch control section
Ridgeport soils have more than 15 percent gravel in the lower third of the series control section. Zenor soils have 4 to 20 percent gravel in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Moderately coarse-textured glacial fluvial sediments reworked by wind.
Landform:  Uplands
Slopes: 6 to 20 percent
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 53 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 34 inches
Frost-free period: 155 to 175 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Filley soils are on similar landscapes with Cortland (P), Malcolm, Malmo, Morril, Pawnee, Burchard, Deroin, Otoe, Wymore, Marshall, Shelby, Steinauer and Hedville soils.  
Deroin, Otoe, Wymore and Marshall soils formed in loess overlying glacial till and contain more silt and clay and less sand than do Filley soils.  In addition Deroin and Otoe have thin surface layers.  
Malcom soils are silty and formed in interglacial sediments on dissected uplands.  
Cortland (P) and Morril formed in glacial outwash sediments and contain more clay.  
Malmo, Pawnee, Burchard, Shelby and Steinauer soils formed in clayey glacial till on uplands and have more clay than Filley soils.  
Hedville soils are shallow over sandstone.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: Well
Runoff: Low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: High and very high

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have been reseeded to or are in native grasses or pasture.  Native vegetation was tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Nebraska and northeast Kansas within the area of MLRA 106. Filley soils are not extensive.
