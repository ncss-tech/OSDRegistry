FULVANCE SERIES

The Fulvance series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Fulvance soils are on mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, high or very high runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, aspen, heartleaf arnica, and elk sedge.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010. The typical pedon is in Routt County, Colorado, Routt Area soil survey area, where this series was proposed in 1999.  The name Fulvance is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 14 to 34 inches.  (upper part of Bt1 horizon)
Ochric epipedon and albic horizon:  The zone from 1 to 14 inches.  (E1 and E2 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 14 to 66 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
