FEPS SERIES

The Feps series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Halaquepts

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Cedarlake (TX) series. Cedarlake soils have more than 25 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section and calcium carbonate equivalent of more than 5 percent in all horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Feps soils are on floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Elevations range from 3,300 to 3,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bodecker and Horner soils.  Bodecker soils are excessively drained and sandy-skeletal.  Horner soils are somewhat excessively drained and sandy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; ponded; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists of cattails, goldenfruit sedge, bermuda grass, saltgrass, and russian thistle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Arizona.  Feps soils are of very little extent.  MLRA is 38.  The named is derived from Phelps Dodge Corporation.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 3 inches (A1, A2 horizons)

Peraquic moisture regime - The soil is saturated within 10 inches of the surface, 12 months of the year.

Recommend that lab data be obtained to confirm n value and SAR.
