Frierson soils are on interfluves and shoulders of hills. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1118 mm to 1372 mm (44 to 54 in) and the mean annual temperature ranges from 17 to 19.5 degrees C (63 to 67 degrees F).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES PROPOSED: Panola County, Texas, 2012. MLRA 133B soil survey area, Texas, 2012. The name is from a town in northeastern De Soto Parish, Louisiana.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Ruston and Elrose series. The series was separated from Ruston based on lack of a bisequm and having a percent base saturation of greater than 35 percent, and from Elrose by forming on a non-glauconitic geology.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Particle size control section: 41 to 91 cm (16 to 36 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in). (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 inches). (Bt horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: None.
