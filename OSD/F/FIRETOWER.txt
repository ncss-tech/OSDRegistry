FIRETOWER SERIES 

The Firetower series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Firetower loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bw1--6 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bw2--17 to 29 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bw3--29 to 42 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine faint redox concentrations in root channels; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick) 

    C1--42 to 51 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium roots; common fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

    C2--51 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; neutral (pH 6.6).

COMPETING SERIES: 

Elkriver (MN) - has a lithologic discontinuity of sandy material at 25 to 44 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - low stream terraces. 
Elevation - 3,300 to 3,800 feet. 
Slope - 0 to 2 percent. 
Parent material - alluvium. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 24 to 30 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rains. 
Mean annual air temperature - 42 to 45 degreed F. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Firetower soils are used for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and western larch.  Understory vegetation consists mainly of rough fescue, common snowberry, shrubby cinquefoil, forbs, and sedges. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Firetower soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1363.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 17 inches (A1, A2 horizons); a cambic horizon from 17 to 42 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A2, Bw1, Bw2 horizons).  Firetower soils have a frigid temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.
