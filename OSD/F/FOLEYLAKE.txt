FOLEYLAKE SERIES

The Foleylake series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from volcanic rocks. Foleylake soils are on plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Abruptic Xeric Argidurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Foleylake very cobbly loam--on a northeast facing slope of 10 percent at 1,545 meters elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(5 or 8 cm thick)

(18 to 25 cm thick)

   Btk--46 to 58 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; secondary carbonates segregated in filaments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (13 to 20 cm thick) 

   Bqkm--58 to 69 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and white (10YR 8/1) cemented material, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; extremely hard; the upper 5 cm is moderately cemented and lower 5 cm is indurated by opaline silica; very few very fine roots in fractures; common very fine tubular pores; few pockets of weakly cemented material; secondary carbonates segregated in common fine filaments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 13 cm thick) 

   R---69 cm; hard, unweathered tuff. 

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Oregon; about 10 miles east of Lake Abert and 0.75 miles northeast of Foley Lake; approximately 1,100 feet north and 1,600 feet east of the southwest corner of section 21, T. 33 S., R. 23 E.; USGS Commodore Ridge 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 42 degrees 41 minutes 26 seconds N and longitude 120 degrees 0 minutes 59 seconds W; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C. 
Ochric epipedon thickness: 15 to 23 cm. 
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 53 to 64 cm. 
Depth to duripan: 53 to 64 cm. 
Depth to bedrock: 56 to 76 cm to a lithic contact. 
Abrupt textural change - An abrupt horizon boundary is normally present between the BA horizon and the Bt horizon accompanied by an increase in clay content of more than 20 percent. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments: 15 to 30 percent, mainly gravel. Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as basalt and unweathered tuff.

Bt horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR

Rock fragments: 15 to 30 percent.
Identifiable secondary carbonates: Occurs as few fine coats or filaments on rock fragments or faces of peds.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent. 
Salinity (EC):  0 to 2 mmhos/cm
Bqkm horizon
Cementation: Weakly cemented or moderately cemented in the upper subzone of the duripan in some pedons, but very strongly cemented or indurated below. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Elhina and Fertaline series. 

Elhina and Fertaline soils do not have lithic contacts within 150 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Foleylake soils are on lava plateaus. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt or unweathered tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,435 to 1,895 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anawalt, Brace, and Freznik soils. Anawalt soils are clayey and shallow to lithic contacts. Brace soils are fine-loamy and moderately deep to duripans overlying lithic contacts. Freznik soils are fine and moderately deep to lithic contacts. These soils are on plateaus. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; slow permeability; low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Foleylake soils are used for livestock grazing. The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg's bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 3,000 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
