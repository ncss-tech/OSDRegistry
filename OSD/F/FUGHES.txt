FUGHES SERIES 

The Fughes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived principally from shale, and interbedded sandstone and shale. The Fughes soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, valley sides, draws, and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fughes loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable; many medium and fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick) 

    BA--5 to 18 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocks; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and fine roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick) 

    Bt1--18 to 30 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 30 inches thick) 

    Bt2--30 to 44 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 22 inches thick) 

    C--44 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; neutral. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Gunnison County, Colorado; about 25 miles northeast of Paonia, on Jacobs Ranch; SE1/4 of Sec. 29, T. 11 S., R. 89 W.; Chair Mountain USGS quadrangle; NAD 27.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chivington, Hillery, Kubler, Savar, Zeeland, and Zoltay series. 
Chivington (WY), Savar (WY), Zeeland (ND), Zoltay (CO)- have horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation above a depth of 40 inches. 
Hillery (NM) - have rock fragments of basalt lithology and have greater than 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Kubler (CO) - have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and have horizons of secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  noncalcareous alluvium and slope alluvium derived principally from Wasatch and Mancos shales, and interbedded sandstone and shale.
Landform:  alluvial fans, terraces, valley sides, draws, and drainageways.
Slopes:  0 to 65 percent.
Elevation:  6,500 to 9,200 feet.
Mean annual temperature: 39 to 46 degrees F. In the Cortez area, temperature ranges to 47 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  18 to 24 inches.
  Driest months: May and June
Frost-free period:  75 to 105 days.  In southeastern Utah the frost-free period is 60 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cochetopa and Curecanti soils.  Cochetopa soils are have a cryic temperature regime, and Curecanti soils are loamy-skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very high runoff; slow and very slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as rangeland.  Native vegetation is mainly Gambel's oak, big sagebrush, Arizona fescue, needleandthread, and western wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of western Colorado and southeastern Utah.  MLRA 47 and 48A.  The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Paonia Area, Colorado, 1976. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Mollic epipedon, pachic feature: from the surface to 18 inches (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon: from 18 to 44 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Particle-size control section: the zone from 18 to 38 inches (the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon)

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998

This revision (7/00) deletes hills, mesas, structural benches, and mountain slopes landforms and colluvium parent material. Mean annual precipitation is revised from 15-24 inches to 18-24 inches. These changes bring the series concept in line with the original series concept.

The 2/99 revision changed the family mineralogy class name from montmorillonitic to smectitic, and changed the allowed depth to a lithic contact from greater than 40 inches to greater than 60 inches.
