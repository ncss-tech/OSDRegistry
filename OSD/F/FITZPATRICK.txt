FITZPATRICK SERIES

The FITZPATRICK series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountain slopes. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and/or shale. Slope is 30 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 48 centimeters (19 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C. (57 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Entic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Fitzpatrick cobbly sandy loam; on a northeast facing slope of 60 percent under blue oak, California foothill pine, California buckwheat, Buckthorn, and yucca. The elevation is 1,250 meters (4,100 feet). (Color is for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described on March 6, 1990 the soil was slightly moist throughout). The surface is covered by 10 percent 2 to 75 millimeter pebbles and 10 percent 75 to 250 millimeter cobbles.

    A--0 to 36 centimeters (0 to 14 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent 2 to 75 millimeter pebbles and 10 percent 75 to 250 millimeter cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Cr--36 to 61 centimeters (14 to 24 inches); weakly cemented sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: San Benito County, California; in Clear Creek Management Area about 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) east-northeast of San Carlos Peak; about 296 meters (970 feet) south and 125 meters (410 feet) east of the northwest corner of section 3, T. 18 S., R. 12 E., Mount Diablo Base and Meridian; latitude 36 degrees 23 minutes 42.3 seconds north and longitude 120 degrees 38 minutes 58.1 seconds west; USGS Idria; California Quadrangle, NAD83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches (25 to 51 centimeters). Surface fragments are composed of sandstone and/or shale; 0 to 50 percent, 2 to 75 millimeter pebbles, 0 to 10 percent, 75 to 250 millimeter cobbles, 0 to 4 percent, 250 to 600 millimeter stones, and 0 to 4 percent, 600 to 3000 millimeter boulders.

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR, dry and moist
Value: 4 or 5 dry and 3 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist
Texture of the fine earth fraction: sandy loam
Content of clay: 5 to 18 percent
Content of organic matter: 1.0 to 3.0 percent
Reaction: moderately acid or slightly acid
Content of rock fragments: 2 to 35 percent, 2 to 75 millimeter pebbles, 2 to 10 percent 75 to 250 millimeter cobbles, 0 to 2 percent 250 to 600 millimeter stones, and 0 to 2 percent, 600 to 3000 millimeter boulders.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ferroburro and Tollhouse series.  Ferroburro soils formed in residuum from granitic rocks at elevations of 1,524 to 2,134 meters (5,000 to 7,000 feet). Tollhouse soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks with a paralithic contact of quartz diorite.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fitzpatrick soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 831 to 1,423 meters (2,726 to 4,669 feet. Slope is 30 to 65 percent. Fitzpatrick soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and/or shale. The consists of hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 457 to 508 millimeters (18 to 20 inches). Mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. (55 to 59 degrees F). Frost-free period is 180 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atravesada, Borreguero, San Carlos, Idriapeak, and Delmexico soils. Atravesada, Idriapeak, and Delmexico soils have magnesic mineralogy. Borreguero soils do not have a mollic epipedon. San Carlos soils are deep to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation and wildlife. The vegetation is blue oak, California foothill pine, California buckwheat, Buckthorn, and yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are in the Clear Creek Management Area, San Benito County, California, in the California Coast Ranges. They are not extensive. MLRA 15. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California 

SERIES PROPOSED: San Benito County, California, 2009. Name comes from Fitzpatrick Spring that is in the area.

REMARKS: The modal pedon for the Fitzpatrick Series is 90CA069078. The Entic subgroup rationale is that there is no cambic horizon in this soil. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Supporting pedons are; 90CA069036, 90CA069080, and 90CA069083
