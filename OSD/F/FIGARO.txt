FIGARO SERIES

The Figaro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium.  They are on alluvial fans, footslopes, mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Figaro cobbly ashy loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inch; partially decomposed needles, twigs and leaves.

    Oe--0.5 to 2 inches; decomposed needles, twigs and leaves. (Combined thickness of O horizons is 1/2 to 3 inches.)

    A--2 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) cobbly ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; 10 percent cobbles and 15 percent pebbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt/E--7 to 18 inches; Bt part (60 percent) grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) cobbly ashy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; E part (40 percent) light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) cobbly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; few faint clay films bridging sand grains and on faces of peds in Bt part; 10 percent cobbles and 15 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt--18 to 30 inches;  grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) ashy clay loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    BC--30 to 43 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) ashy clay loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure; hard, frim, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots, few medium and coarse roots; common medium tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

    C--43 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) ashy clay loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and medium roots; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Figaro soils are mainly used for woodland, understory grazing, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The potential overstory vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, Englemann spruce and whitebark pine. Understory vegetation is mainly grouse whortleberry, elk sedge, Oregongrape, common beargrass, and pinegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Figaro soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

REMARKS:   Soil interpretive record: MT1743.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from 2 to 7 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 7 to 30 inches (Bt/E and Bt horizons); a particle size control section from 7 to 27 inches (Bt/E and part of Bt horizons).  Figaro soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.
