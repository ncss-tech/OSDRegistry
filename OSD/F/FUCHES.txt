FUCHES SERIES

The Fuches series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from rhyolite or acidic tuff. The Fuches soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, isotic, mesic Lithic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Fuches gravelly sandy loam on a southeast facing, 38 percent slope under chamise, buckbrush, live oak, and manzanita at an elevation of 786 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on August 12, 2009the soil was dry throughout.)

 A--0 to 6 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; common very fine, fine, and medium irregular pores; 20 percent subangular very strongly cemented acidic tuff gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 10 centimeters thick)

 Bw--6 to 30 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular and medium tubular pores; 20 percent subangular very strongly cemented acidic tuff gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 45 centimeters thick)

 R--30 cm; strongly cemented acidic tuff bedrock, fractured at intervals of 45 to <100 cm.                 

TYPE LOCATION: Calaveras County, California; about  8 km (5miles) northeast of the town of Mountain Ranch, CA, USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle: Fort Mountain, California; WGS84 38.289722 latitude and -120.488609 longitude; UTM Zone 10 719646 meters E 4240943 meters N NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm is 8 to 15 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a mesic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to October. The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Fuches soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum weathered from acidic tuff or rhyolite. Elevation is 675 to 975 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 970 to 1190 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 195 to 245 days.                   

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Swissranch, Supan, Crozier, McCarthy, and Iron Mountain soils. The Swissranch soils occur in pockets in similar hillslope positions as Fuches, but are very deep to bedrock and under natural conditions support native tree species. Supan, Iron Mountain, Crozier and McCarthy soils develop from more basic volcanic rocks such as basic tuff breccia, tuff, or agglomerate. Supan, Crozier, and McCarthy soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Iron Mountain soils have a mollic epipedon.	

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well Drained; moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the soil profile. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is low to very high.                                   

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation under natural conditions is mostly native shrubs with some forbs in the understory. Shrub species include manzanita, chamise, buckbrush, and live oak. Creeping sage is often present in the understory. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. This series is not extensive.
