FANU SERIES

The Fanu series consists of very deep, well drained soils on inset fans, drainageways, and alluvial terraces. Fanu soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haploxerolls

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.  
Mollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 152 cm. 
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 18 to 60 cm.
Mineralogy: 12 to 20 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction and averages 0.01 to 0.05 percent Al plus 1/2Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent.

Chroma: 2 or 3 moist. 
Organic matter: 1 to 2 percent. 
Rock fragments: Some pedons contain sub-horizons that average between 15 to 60 percent rock fragments.
Texture: Sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or loam, some pedons have thin subhorizons of coarse sand or sand.

Reaction: Moderately to strongly alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 4 percent in the fine earth fraction. 
Secondary calcium carbonate: 1 to 10 percent as fine and medium masses on the bottom of rock fragments with masses in most pedons concentrated towards lower sub-horizons. 
Clay films: Some pedons contain upper sub-horizons with few faint clay films on the faces of peds.  
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Birdow, Blackrock, Collister, Dagor, Draper, Eastcan, Goose Creek, Goosenawt, Gosinta, Heidtman, Lakeview, Monroe, OXY, Shoepeg, Willowdale and Winn series. 

Birdow soils do not have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations in the lower horizons. Blackrock, Collister, Dagor, Draper, Eastcan, Goose Creek, Goosenawt, Gosinta, Heidtman, Lakeview, Monroe, Oxy, Shoepeg, Willowdale and Winn soils are not dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fanu soils are on inset fans, drainageways, and alluvial terraces. Fanu soils formed in alluvium from welded tuff, with minor amounts of limestone at elevations of 1,700 to 2,050 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, and the frost-free season is about 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ravendog and Fifteenmile soils. Ravendog soils average 8 to 18 percent clay in the control section. Fifteenmile soils have an ochric epipedon that averages 25 to 40 cm thick and have a cambic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; slow or medium runoff; ; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are subject to occasional overflow in localized areas along narrow floodplains and adjacent to stream channels.

USE AND VEGETATION: Grazing and wildlife habitat are the primary uses. The principal vegetation is basin big sagebrush, Great Basin wildrye, squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass. Some bitterbrush and cliffrose occur at upper elevations. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R028AY091NV, Loamy Fan 10-12 P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada; Fanu soils are of small extent. MLRA 29.

REMARKS: Prior to 2009 Fanu series was formerly classified as a Torrifluventic Haploxerolls.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to 152 cm (A1, A2, Bw, Bk, C2 and 2Ck horizons).
Fluventic feature - Irregular decrease in organic carbon, based on color. 
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw, Bk, C2 and part of A2 and 2Ck horizons).
