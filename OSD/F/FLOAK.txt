FLOAK SERIES

The Floak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over limestone or calcareous sandstone.  Depth to hard bedrock is 50 to 100 cm.  Floak soils are on mountain slopes and dip slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aagard, Avintaquin, Osote, and Paunsaugunt series.  The Avintaquin and Paunsaugunt soils are on convex positions and do not have argillic horizons. Aagard soils are very deep and are in concave drainageways.  Osote soils are very deep, do not have argillic horizons, and are on mountain bases. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Floak soils are primarily used for grazing as native rangeland.  Native vegetation consists of Gambel oak, Rocky mountain juniper, Mountain big sagebrush, Utah serviceberry, Snowberry, Bitterbrush, Salina wildrye, Wheat grass, Blue grass, Needle grass and Oregon grape.  Utah correlates this soil to Mountain Loam (Oak) 048AY415UT range site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah mountains; LRR E, MLRA 48A; The Series is of small extent.
