FINCASTLE SERIES

The Fincastle series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. Fincastle soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Coulterville, Gavers, and Millstadt series. Coulterville soils have more than 5 percent exchangeable sodium in subhorizons of the argillic horizon. Gavers soils are deeper than 152 cm (60 inches) to carbonates. Millstadt soils have sola thicker than 152 cm (60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fincastle soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9.4 to 12.2 degrees C (49 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 175 to 185 days. Elevation is 168 to 308 meters (550 to 1,100 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cyclone, Miami, Russell, Treaty, Williamstown, and Xenia soils. The poorly drained Cyclone and Treaty soils are on lower landscape positions and have mollic epipedons. The moderately well drained Miami soils, the well drained Russell soils, and the moderately well drained Xenia soils form a drainage sequence with the Fincastle soils. They are on higher lying positions on summits, or on lower lying, more sloping positions on shoulders and backslopes. The moderately well drained Williamstown soils are also on higher lying positions on summits, or on lower lying, more sloping positions on shoulders and backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) during winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum, and low or moderately low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum; moderately slow in the lower part of the solum; and slow or very slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, and clover-grass mixtures are the principal crops. Native vegetation is hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mainly in MLRAs 111A and 111D and to lesser extent in MLRAs 108A, 111B, 111C, 114A, 114B, and 115C in central and south-central Indiana, eastern Illinois, and southwestern Ohio. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of large extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wayne County, Indiana, 1925.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, E horizons).
Albic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 33 cm (E horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 127 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).
Densic contact: at 150 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features in all horizons between a depth of 25 and 150 cm. 

A bedrock substratum phase is recognized and may become a new series as subset soil surveys with this phase are updated.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon, S1978IN139012, from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.
