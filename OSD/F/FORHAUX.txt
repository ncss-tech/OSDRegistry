FORHAUX SERIES

The Forhaux series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Forhaux soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1525 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Pachic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Forhaux gravelly loam soil on a south facing convex slope of 23 percent under annual and perennial grasses and forbs, and western bracken fern. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated) When described on May 24, 2006, the soil was moist throughout.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days after the summer solstice and moist in all parts from November through May. The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 11 to 15 degrees C. and the difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures is more than 9 degrees C. The soils have a mesic soil temperature regime. 

Umbric Epipedon: 50 to 110 centimeters thick

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hiddenridge (WA) and Chalkmountain (CA) series. Hiddenridge is 100 to 152 centimeters to a lithic contact. Chalkmountain has a difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature of 6 to 9 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Forhaux soils are on convex summit, shoulder, and backslope positions on ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Elevations are 0 to 1060 meters. These soils formed in residuum from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1270 to 2280 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Oceanhouse, Peaked, and Pigtoe soils. Oceanhouse soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, have redoximorphic features at 0 to 10 centimeters, and are on concave backslope positions on slopes dominated by earthflows. Peaked soils have redoximorphic features between 50 and 100 centimeters and are on linear to slightly convex or concave summit and backslope positions. Pigtoe soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle control section and are on linear to slightly concave or convex summit, shoulder, and backslope positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation is annual and perennial grasses and forbs, including bristly dogstail grass, wild oat, slender oat, hairy catsear, common sheep sorrel, California poppy, and western brackenfern. Some siteshave scattered coyotebrush. Douglas-fir can invade in the absence of fire and grazing.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
