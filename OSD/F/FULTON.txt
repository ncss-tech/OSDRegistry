FULTON SERIES

The Fulton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains. They formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bennington, Blount, Del Rey, Kimmell, Mahoning, and Nappanee series. Bennington, Blount, Mahoning, and Nappanee soils have more than 1 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Del Rey and Kimmell soils have less than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Fulton soils are on slightly convex or planar surfaces on lake plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent, but typically are 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in fine-textured, calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 152 to 305 meters (500 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained Lucas soils and the very poorly drained Bono, Latty, and Toledo soils. The Bono soils have a mollic epipedon and are on broad, nearly level areas or in depressions. The Latty soils are on broad flat areas of the lake plain and are on slightly lower topographic positions. The Lucas soils are on more sloping areas along drainageways or on higher topographic positions. The Toledo soils have a dark surface and are on lower topographic positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 30 cm (0.5 to 1.0 foot) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or low in the substratum. Permeability is slow or very slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is cultivated, primarily corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, and hay. A small portion is in permanent pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwood forest; primarily swamp white oak, northern red oak, pin oak, red maple, and beech.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Primarily in MLRA 99 in northwestern Ohio and southern Michigan; and to a lesser extent in MLRA 139 in north central Ohio, and in intermorainal lake beds in MLRA 111B in west-central Ohio and northern Indiana. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fulton County, Ohio, 1922.

REMARKS: The present concept limits the Fulton series to soils with silty clay or clay argillic horizons and clay content of more than 35 percent in the C horizon. Some Fulton soils mapped in older surveys with less clay in the B and C horizons would now be included in the Kibbie or Del Rey series. A till substratum phase is recognized. The loamy, sandy, and gravelly substratum phases that were mapped in earlier surveys have substrata at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). These phases will not meet current criteria for substratum phases, and will be correlated as new series during future modernization projects.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 96 cm (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 25 cm.

Representative DMU ID number is 152870 in MO 11.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for pedons LG-24, PT-26, and SN-13 from Ohio. Laboratory characterization data is available for Indiana pedon ST7601, sampled at Purdue University.
