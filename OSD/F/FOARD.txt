FOARD SERIES

The Foard series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils. They formed in material weathered from old alluvium of granitic outwash over shales and clays from Permian red beds. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad summits and shoulder slopes of terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Vertic Natrustolls
