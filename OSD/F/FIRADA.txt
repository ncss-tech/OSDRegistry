FIRADA SERIES

The Firada series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, or materials derived mainly from limestone.  These soils are on mountainsides and uplands.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Firada cobbly clay loam, woodland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

    E--1 to 4 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 25 percent angular cobbles, 5 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw1--4 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 25 percent angular cobbles, 15 percent angular gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--14 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly light clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 30 percent angular cobbles, 20 percent angular gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 5 to 25 inches)

    Bk--18 to 26 inches; light brownish gray 910YR 6/2) extremely flaggy light clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 45 percent flagstones, 30 percent angular gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 27 inches thick)

    R--26 inches; extremely hard fractured limestone.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fergus County, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0310.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 4 inches (E horizon); a cambic horizon from 4 to 18 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 inches to the lithic contact; a horizon of carbonate accumulation from 18 to 26 inches (Bk horizon); and a lithic contact at 26 inches (R horizon).  Firada soils have a udic moisture regime and a cryic temperature regime.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
