FARMTON SERIES

The Farmton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments. Farmton soils are on flatwoods and low broad flats on marine terraces.  Slopes are linear and range from 0 to 2 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C. (72 degrees F.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Arenic Ultic Alaquods
