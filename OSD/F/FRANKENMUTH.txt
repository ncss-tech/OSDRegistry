FRANKENMUTH SERIES

The Frankenmuth series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, mesic Aquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Frankenmuth very fine sandy loam, on a 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 inches) thick]

 E--23 to 33 cm (9 to 13 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bt--33 to 46 cm (13 to 18 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; many distinct and common faint silt coatings on faces of peds; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common medium prominent greenish gray (5G 6/1) iron depletions; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [10 to 23 cm (4 to 9 inches) thick]

 2C1--46 to 89 cm (18 to 35 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sand; massive; friable; common medium and coarse distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

 2C2--89 to 152 cm (35 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified very fine sand and silty clay loam; massive with weak medium and thin plates inherent from deposition; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) silty clay coatings; common coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and common coarse prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron; few fine and common coarse prominent greenish gray (5G 6/1) iron depletions; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Saginaw County, Michigan; about 8 miles northeast of the city of Saginaw; 650 feet south and 100 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 33, T. 13 N., R. 3 E.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Frankenmuth soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. They formed in stratified calcareous silt loam, very fine sand, and silty clay loam containing lenses of finer and coarser textures.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pella, Strawn, Gagetown, Tappan, and Londo soils. The poorly drained Pella and Tappan soils are in shallow depressions in the landscape. The Londo soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions. The moderately well drained Gagetown and well drained Strawn soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, sugar beets, soybeans, edible beans, and small grain are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in the Saginaw valley area of Lower Michigan. This series is of small extent.
