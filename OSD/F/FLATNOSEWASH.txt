FLATNOSEWASH SERIES

The Flatnosewash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and reworked lacustrine deposits derived from welded tuff and small amounts of limestone. Flatnosewash soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Xeric Torrifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Flatnosewash silt loam, rangeland and farmland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 A--0 to 4 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; strong very coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very coarse vesicular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

 A2--4 to 20 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very coarse interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 15 to 35 cm thick) 

 C1--20 to 46 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (13 to 48 cm thick) 

 C2--46 to 140 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of C1 and C2 horizons is 100 to 130 cm) 

 C3--140 to 150 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Nevada; approximately 895 feet west and 1,125 feet south of the northeast corner of section 1, T. 01 S., R. 68 E.; USGS Rose Valley 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 53 minutes 31.4 seconds N, longitude 114 degrees 19 minutes 7.5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.8920639 latitude, -114.3183333 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to summer convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Mineralogy: 5 to 24 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction and averages 0.01 to 0.05 percent Al plus  Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent. 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent.

A horizons
Value: 5 or 6 dry. 
Chroma: 2 through 4 dry or moist.
Calcium Carbonate equivalence: 5 to 15 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.

C1 and C2 horizons
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 0 to 15 percent with some pedons containing alluvial lens sub-horizons with 15 to 45 percent gravel. 
Texture: Loam or silt loam. 
Consistence: Nonsticky through moderately sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline. 
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Calcium Carbonate equivalence: 10 to 25 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  

C3 horizon
Chroma: 4 or 6 dry and moist
Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent. 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent with some pedons containing sub-horizons that average 35 to 55 percent gravel. 
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. 
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Calcium carbonate equivalence: 15 to 25 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Wales series. Wales soils lack 5 to 24 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flatnosewash soils are on stream terraces and alluvial flats. These soils formed in alluvium and reworked lacustrine deposits derived from welded tuff and small amounts of limestone. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 1,450 to 1,714 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C and the frost-free season is about 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pahranagat and Heist series. Pahranagat soils have a mollic epipedon that averages 25 to 50 cm thick. Heist soils have a cambic feature above the C horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing and cultivated crops. These soils are used for cultivated crops of alfalfa, small grains, and pasture. The potential native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, winterfat, basin wildrye, and Indian ricegrass. This soil is correlated to ecological site R029XY114NV, Loamy Fan 8-12" P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central and southeastern Nevada. These soils are of a small extent. MLRA 29.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County (Meadow Valley Soil Survey), Nevada, 2010. 

REMARKS: Type location was moved in 1990 to better reflect the series concept. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm (A1 and part of A2 horizons). 
Torrifluvent feature - Irregular decrease in organic carbon based on color. 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C1 and the upper part of C2 horizon).
