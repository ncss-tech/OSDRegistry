FRAZWELL SERIES

The Frazwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces and in draws of fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Frazwell sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 14 inches thick)

    Bw4--29 to 40 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; few faint clay films on ped faces and bridging sand grains; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

    2Ab--40 to 45 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent cobble and 45 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    2Btb--45 to 62 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; few faint clay films on ped faces and bridging sand grains; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Coconino County, Arizona; on the Hualapai Indian Reservation; approximately 2 miles northeast of Blue Mountain; 250 feet east and 2580 feet north of the southwest corner of Section 19, T. 26 N., R. 8 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Moist in some part of the control section during December - March and July - September.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 52 to 56 degrees F.

Rock fragments: Averages less than 10 percent gravel above 29 inches; a stone line containing 40 to 55 percent rock fragments overlies the buried horizons

Calcium carbonate equivalent: noneffervescent in the upper solum; less than 5 percent in the buried soil

Depth to calcium carbonate: greater than 30 inches when present

Thickness of mollic epipedon: 20 to 45 inches

Depth to buried horizons: 34 to more than 60 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bon (SD), Lynx (AZ), Manzano (NM), Maskell (NE), Mauricanyon (CO), Merrick (NE), Pack (UT), Shanta (NM), St. Onge (SD) and Umbarg (CO) series.  Bon, Draper, Humbarger, Shanta, St. Onge and Umbarg soils are calcareous throughout.  Manzano and Mauricanyon soils contain segregated lime in the lower control section and do not have buried horizons.  Lynx soils have ustic aridic soil moisture regimes.  Mauricanyon, Maskell and Merrick soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June.  Pack soils have redoximorphic features at depths less than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frazwell series are on fan terraces and in draws of fan terraces.  Elevations are 5500 to 6000 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches.  Approximately half the precipitation falls during the winter months as snow and rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bleumont, Buckndoe, Disterheff, Milkweed, and Thunderbird series.  Bleumont and Disterheff soils have fine textured argillic horizons and lack a mollic epipedon.  Buckndoe soils have loamy-skeletal particle size control sections.  Thunderbird soils are moderately deep to basalt.  Milkweed soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Frazwell soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is dominantly blue grama, needleandthread, bottlebrush squirreltail and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
