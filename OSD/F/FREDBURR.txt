FREDBURR SERIES

The Fredburr series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. These soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Oxyaquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Fredburr fine sandy loam, in rangeland on a 0 percent slope at 990 meters elevation (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

	A--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine and medium roots and common coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 17 cm thick)

	C1--13 to 71 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (52 to 91 cm thick)

	C2--71 to 91 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 96 cm thick)

	C3--91 to 152 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly sand, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES: 
Handke (MT) - have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the subsurface horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - flood plains and flood-plain steps
Elevation - 970 to 1,405 meters
Slope - 0 to 2 percent
Parent material - alluvium 
Climate - Long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 305 to 355 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C
Frost-free period - 90 to 115 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained; very rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Fredburr soils are used primarily for wildlife habitat and pasture and rangeland. The vegetation is mainly reedgrasses, mannagrass, snowberry, and willows. Groves of black cottonwood trees and ponderosa pine occur in some areas

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Fredburr soils are of small extent in the intermountain valleys of southwest Montana. MLRA 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bitterroot Valley Area, Montana, 2013; proposed in Ravalli County, Montana, 2012.

REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 13 cm (A horizon)
Redoximorphic features - from 71 to 152 cm (C2 and C3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the C1, C2, and part of the C3 horizons)

Fredburr soils have a frigid temperature regime, an ustic moisture regime, and an oxyaquic moisture subclass.
