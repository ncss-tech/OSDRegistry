FEEDER SERIES

The Feeder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and loess influenced alluvium. Feeder soils have slopes of 0 to 40 percent and are on hillslopes, fan remnants, and valley floors. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Feeder silt loam, located on an east facing slightly concave slope of 8 percent and elevation of 1,670 meters; when described on June 6, 1989, the soil was dry throughout (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted)

 A--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate thin platy parting to moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary

 Bw--10 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary

 Bk1--30 to 66 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; common fine threadlike and irregular calcium carbonate masses and many weakly cemented calcium carbonate nodules; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary

 Bk2--66 to 142 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine, common medium, and few fine tubular pores; few fine threadlike and irregular calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary

 Bk3--142 to 168 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common fine threadlike calcium carbonate masses; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)
