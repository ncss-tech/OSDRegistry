FRIEDLIVER SERIES

The Friedliver series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid rocks. Friedliver soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.5 degrees C (65 degrees F).

Goldivide soils have an argillic horizon with an upper boundary between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) from the soil surface and an upper depth to visible secondary carbonates of 25 to 75 centimeters (10 to 30 inches). Helendale soils have an argillic horizon with an upper boundary between 2 and 25 centimeters (1 to 10 inches) from the soil surface. Hexie and Littlefargo soils have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) from the soil surface. In addition, Littlefargo soils are noneffervescent throughout the profile. Jumborox soils are cool thermic with a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 19 degrees C. Searchlight soils have visible secondary silica on rock fragments beginning 5 centimeters below the mineral soil surface and 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the profile. Sonoita soils have a medium acid to neutral A horizon and are intermittently moist for more than 20 days cumulative during the summer. Tray soils have a strongly to very strongly alkaline argillic horizon with an ESP of 15 to 30 and are calcareous throughout the profile.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Friedliver soils are on fan aprons over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid rocks. Elevations range from 610 to 1050 meters (2,000 to 3,445 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C (63 to 68 degrees F). The frost-free season is 270 to 320 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cajon soils. Cajon soils are on fan aprons, have sandy particle-size control sections and do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Friedliver soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosote bush and burrobush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
