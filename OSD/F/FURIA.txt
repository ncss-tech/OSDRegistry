FURIA SERIES

The Furia series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Furia soils are on flood plains and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Furia clay loam, on a northeast facing, linear, 1 percent slope in grass at an elevation of 7,460 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on April 12, 2001 the soil was moist from 0 to 72 inches.

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Ag--4 to 16 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium roots; common fine and medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) yellowish red (5YR 4/6) concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

    Bg1--16 to 32 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (N 3/) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) concentrations; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bg2--32 to 43 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay, black (N 2.5/) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) concentrations; very slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bg horizons is 25 to 40 inches)

    Cg--43 to 72 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (N 3/) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; ; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) concentrations; very slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2).

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (part of the Ag, Bg1 and part of the Bg2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 72 inches.  (A, Ag, Bg1, Bg2, and Bg3 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations and depletions:  In the zone from 4 to 72 inches. (Ag, Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 horizons)  
Endosaturation:  The zone of saturation at 8 to 72 inches. (Ag, Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
