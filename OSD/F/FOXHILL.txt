FOXHILL SERIES

The Foxhill series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess influenced alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Foxhill silt loam, in pastureland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Bt--41 to 66 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; 50 percent prominent clay films on all faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary

 Btg1--66 to 96 cm; gray (10YR 6/1), silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent prominent very dark brown (10YR 2/2) manganese masses; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary

 Btg2--96 to 130 cm; gray (10YR 5/1), silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent prominent very dark brown (10YR 2/2) manganese masses; 5 percent greenish gray (Gley 6/5GY) moist iron depletions throughout; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary

 Bg--130 to 150 cm; gray (10YR 5/1), silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 2 percent prominent very dark brown (10YR 2/2) manganese masses and 8 percent prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) iron masses; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3)
