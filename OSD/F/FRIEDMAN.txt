FRIEDMAN SERIES

The Friedman series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from mixed volcanic materialand extrusive igneous rocks.  Friedman soils occur on glacial moraines, foothills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Pachic Argicryolls

(9 to 14 inches thick)

    Bt3--47 to 54 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); diffuse irregular boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    2R--54 inches; weathered latite or welded tuff bedrock

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Castino, Doughspon, Hamtah, Percoun, Urwill, and Winnemucca series.  Castino and Percoun soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Doughspon soils do not have a xeric moisture regime.  Hamtah soils have average annual soil temperature warmer than 43 degrees F, have slightly alkaline reaction in the Bt3 horizons and have much of the original rock structure in the lower Bt horizon.  Urwill soils formed in less than 16 inches of
precipitation and have a dry color value of 6 in the surface layer.  Winnemucca soils are 24 to 42 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and developed in 25 to 30 inches of precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Friedman soils occur on glacial moraines, foothills and mountains and have slopes that range from 5 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 9,500 feet.  The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from mixed volcanic materials.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 41 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 22 inches.  The frost-free period is less than 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Elksel, Muldoon, Peevywell, Smelter, Starhope, and Winridge soils.  Elksel soils have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in the upper 75cm of the soil.  Muldoon soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are deep to a duripan.  Peevywell are moderately deep to a duripan.  Smelter soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Starhope soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Winridge soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Elksel, Smelter, Starhope, and Winridge soils occur on the same landscape.  Muldoon and Peevywell soils occur on fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural plant community includes mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is of moderate extent in east central and south central Idaho.
