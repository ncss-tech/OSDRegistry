FIEDLER SERIES

The Fiedler series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate. Fiedler soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1275 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, isomesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Fiedler silt loam on a southwest facing 29 percent slope under a canopy of coast redwood, western swordfern and poison oak in the understory, at an elevation of 253 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on 5/13/1999 the soil was moist to 152 centimeters.

 Bt3--105 to 152 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) broken face clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) dry; strong medium subangular blocky structure; firm, hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 15 percent clay films on surfaces along root channels and 15 percent faint clay films on surfaces along pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid, pH 5.8. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 122 to 145 centimeters)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fiedler soils are on linear to concave positions on backslopes on mountains. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 30 to 450 meters. These soils formed in colluvium derived from weakly consolidated siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nanningcreek (CA) and Petellen (CA) soils. Nanningcreek have redoximorphic features from 50 to 100 centimeters and are found on linear to convex positions on mountain slopes. Petellen soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments and are found on convex to slightly concave positions on mountains slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high or very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes coast redwood, Douglas-fir, grand fir, red alder, poison oak, California huckleberry, coyote brush, western swordfern, blue blossom, and thimbleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
