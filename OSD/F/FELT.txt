FELT SERIES

The Felt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Felt soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Felt silt loam on a fan remnant with 4 percent slope at 1937 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap1 -- 0 to 11 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; moderately hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary.

 Ap2 -- 11 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few medium tubular and many very fine tubular pores; common calcium carbonate masses; 11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Ap or A horizons is 20 to 36 cm)

 Bk -- 25 to 60 centimeters; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and few medium tubular, and common very fine dendritic tubular pores; many calcium carbonate masses on surfaces along pores; 29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 63 cm thick)

 Bkq1 -- 60 to 78 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately few very fine roots; common very fine irregular and many very fine tubular pores; silica on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; discontinuous calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of rock fragments; many calcium carbonate masses; 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 30 percent limestone gravel, 5 percent limestone cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 18 cm thick)

 2Bkq2 -- 78 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; interstitial pores; continuous silica and calcium carbonate coats on bottom surfaces of all rock fragments; 61 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 65 percent limestone gravel, 10 percent limestone cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)

TYPE LOCATION: Teton County, Idaho; about 5.5 kilometers southeast of Driggs; 313 meters east and 84 meters south of the southwest corner of section 8, T. 4 N., R. 46 E.; Driggs USGS topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees, 41 minutes, 35.3 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees, 3 minutes, 24.6 seconds W., NAD 83.

Control section carbonate clay: 0 to 10 percent 
Control section rock fragments: 0 to 35 percent above the discontinuity (averages less than 15 percent) and 15 to 75 percent below the discontinuity 
Depth to calcic horizon: 20 to 36 cm
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 25 to 61 percent in the calcic horizon with less than 40 percent average in the control section

Effervescence: strong or violent

2Bkq or 2Bk
Value: 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist

COMPETING SERIES: There are no soil series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: alluvial and outwash plains
Landform: fan remnants and stream terraces
Elevation: 1801 to 2001 meters
Slope: 0 to 20 percent
Parent material: mixed alluvium
Mean annual air temperature: 3.3 to 6.7 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 457 mm
Frost free period: 40 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Feltonia, Arimo, Altaby, and Alpine soil series. None of these soils have surface effervescence. Of the geographically associated soils, Feltonia soils are found on the highest positions on fan remnants and stream terraces. Feltonia soils have a coarse-loamy particle size class. Arimo and Altaby soils are found in slightly lower positions on fan remnants than Feltonia soils and have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size class. Alpine soils are in concave swales on fan remnants, have a loamy-skeletal particle size class, and have carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: well drained
Runoff: low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high in the upper part and very high in the lower part

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: irrigated areas are used primarily for small grains, seed potatoes, hay and pasture; nonirrigated areas are used for pasture and range. Dominant native vegetation: bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass, prairie junegrass, phlox, yarrow, mountain big sagebrush, and rabbitbrush

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Eastern Idaho and Western Wyoming, MLRA 13
Extent: the series is not extensive
