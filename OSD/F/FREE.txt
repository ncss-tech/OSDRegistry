FREE SERIES

The Free series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. The Free soils formed in loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Colwood and Springerton series. Colwood and Springerton soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Free soils are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loamy and gravelly outwash. They are deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 940 mm (35 to 37 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 11 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Comfrey, Crane, Tippecanoe, and Wea soils. The very poorly drained or poorly drained Comfrey soils have mollic epipedons more than 61 cm (24 inches) thick and are on flood plains. The somewhat poorly drained Crane soils are browner in the upper part of the solum and are on nearly low lying rises. The moderately well drained Tippecanoe soils and the well drained Wea soils are on nearby slopes and rises.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all areas of this soil are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain and legume hay are the principal crops. Native vegetation is tall prairie grass, chiefly big bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central and northwestern Indiana; MLRAs 110 and 111D. The type location is in MLRA 110. The series is of small extent.
