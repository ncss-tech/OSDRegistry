FOOLHEN SERIES 

The Foolhen series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, alluvial fans, outwash plains, drainageways and closed depressions. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Foolhen loam, 0 to 4 percent slopes, in rangeland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed organic matter. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

    A--2 to 9 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bw--9 to 20 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; many medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) and olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) dry redox concentrations; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 11 inches thick) 

    Cg1--20 to 27 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam with lenses of loamy sand 1 to 2 inches thick, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; many medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) and olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) dry redox concentrations; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Cg2--27 to 46 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) gravelly loam, olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) dry; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) dry redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Cg3--46 to 60 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) gravelly loam, yellow (2.5Y 7/6) dry; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) dry redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). (combined thickness of the Cg horizons - 36 to 53 inches)
