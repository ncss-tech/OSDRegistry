FLORAS SERIES

The Floras series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types. Floras soils are on side slopes of forested coastal hills and mountains. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2800 millimeters (110 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TYPE LOCATION: Curry County, Oregon, about 1,600 feet south and 480 meters (1,575 feet) west of the northeast corner of sec. 4, T. 41 S., R. 13 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C (54 to 59 degrees F), the mean summer soil temperature is 11.5 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F), and the mean winter soil temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures varies from 3 to less than 6 degrees C.  The soils have an isomesic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) in the four months following the summer solstice.  The soils have a udic moisture regime.

Depth to a paralithic contact is 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Floras soils are on metastable to active side slopes of forested coastal hills and mountains. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanics. Elevations are 61 to 396 meters (200 to 1,300 feet). The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature. The mean annual precipitation is 2286 to 3002 millimeters (90 to 130 inches). The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bosland, Dulandy, Guerin, Loeb, Macklyn, Vondergreen, Wedderburn, and Zwagg soils. Bosland and Dulandy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Bosland soils are fine-loamy. Dulandy soils are loamy-skeletal. Guerin soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) deep to a lithic contact and are loamy-skeletal. Loeb, Macklyn, and Vondergreen soils have argillic horizons. Wedderburn soils are 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) deep to a lithic contact and are fine-loamy. Zwagg soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a lithic contact and are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very highrunoff; moderately low saturated hydralic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are mainly used for timber production, water supply, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas fir, redwood, tanoak, California laurel, red alder, red elderberry, Pacific rhododendron, evergreen huckleberry, western swordfern, salal, cascade Oregongrape, common beargrass, and Pacific trillium.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belts; MLRA 4B The series is not extensive.
