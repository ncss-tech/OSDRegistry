COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Farewell soils are on nearly level flood plains and low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in loamy alluvium. Elevations are commonly 400 to 1,150 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearthicket, Deible, Higdon, Relfe, Sandbur, Tanglenook, and Zanoni soils. All of these are on similar landscape positions as Farewell soils. Bearthicket soils are well drained and are in the fine-silty family. Deible and Tanglenook soils are poorly drained and are in the fine family. Higdon soils have an ochric epipedon and are in the fine-silty family. Relfe soils are excessively drained and are in the sandy-skeletal family. Sandbur and Zanoni soils are well drained and are in the coarse-loamy family.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is negligible to very high. Permeability is moderate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Most areas are subject to flooding.  These soils have an apparent water table within 18 inches of the surface during wet periods in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for hay and pasture production. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks Highland area (MLRA 116A) of south-central Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Howell County, Missouri soil survey; 2004. The name comes from a hollow near where the soil was first identified.  

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:
1) Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 24 inches(Ap, A1, and A2 horizons)
2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 24 to 80 inches (Btg horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: This soil is being mapped predominantly in the Jefferson City and Roubidoux formation (Ordivician age) in Missouri.

Sampled for the University of Missouri Soil Characterization Lab as M9609131.
