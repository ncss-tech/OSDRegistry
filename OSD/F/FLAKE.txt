FLAKE SERIES

The Flake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine-loamy alluvium. These nearly level soils are on alluvial flats on basin floors. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: Ther are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flake soils are on alluvial flats on basin floors. Slope is 1 to 3 percent. These soils formed from fine-loamy alluvium. Elevation ranges from 3,900 to 4,040 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Corvus, Jato, Loki, Talos, Yesum. Corvus soils have petrogypsic horizons between 5 and 20 inches and are on relict dunes and fan piedmonts. Jato and Loki soils have alumno-slica material capping gypsum evaporites and are on relict lakebeds. Talos soils are greater than 40 percent clay in the particle size control section and have argillic horizons. Yesum soils are coarse-loamy and have gypsic horizons within 7 inches from the surface (Leptic).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, burrograss, desert seepweed and iodine bush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin and surrounding piedmonts. MLRA 42, Flake is of limited extent.
