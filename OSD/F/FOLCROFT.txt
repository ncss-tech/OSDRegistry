FOLCROFT SERIES

The Folcroft series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in human-transported materials with more than 10 percent artifacts over fluviomarine deposits. They occur where land leveling, and other construction activities took place on filled marshlands and alluvial deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1200 mm. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, pauciartifactic, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Folcroft gravelly artifactual loam, 0 to 8 percent slopes on a filled stream terrace under a cover of mixed hardwoods at an elevation of 3 meters. (Colors are for moist soils, unless otherwise noted.)

 ^Au--0 to 19 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2), gravelly-artifactual loam; strong medium granular structure; friable; many medium roots throughout and common very coarse roots throughout; 15 percent rounded mixed gravels; 3 percent gravel sized asphalt and 10 percent cobble sized brick fragments; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 25 centimeters thick)

 ^Bwu1--19 to 30 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very cobbly-artifactual sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots throughout; many fine vesicular pores; 15 percent rounded mixed gravels; 20 percent persistent cobble sized artifacts such as concrete, brick, porcelain and glass; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 ^Bwu2--30 to 90 centimeters; dark brown (10YR 3/3); very cobbly-artifactual sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots throughout; many fine vesicular pores; 20 percent rounded mixed gravels; 20 percent persistent cobble sized artifacts such as concrete and brick; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of ^Bw is 30 to 100 centimeters thick)

 2BC1--90 to 130 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly loam; moderate fine platy structure; firm; few fine roots throughout; many fine tubular pores; many medium brown (7.5YR 4/2) iron depletions at bottom of horizon; 30 percent rounded mixed gravels, 2 percent rounded mixed cobbles, 1 percent subangular mixed stones; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 2BC2--130 to 190 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; 15 percent rounded mixed gravels; slightly acid. (Combined thickness of 2BC is 0 to 120 centimeters thick)

 3Ab--190 to 200 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) fine sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent Material--Human-transported material over alluvial deposits or marshland
Slope--0 to 15 percent
Elevation--0 to 30 meters 
Frost-free period--190 to 240 days

Beltsville soils--are moderately well drained, on broad uplands
Butlertown soils--are moderately well drained, on broad uplands
Elkton soils--are poorly drained have a fine-silty particle-size control section, on slightly lower landforms
Greenbelt soils--are well drained and are derived from human-transported materials with less than 10% artifacts, on similar landforms.
Mannington soils--are very poorly drained, on tidal marshes 
Nanticoke soils--are very poorly drained, on tidal marshes
Othello soils--are poorly drained, on drainageways or depressions
Pineyneck soils--are moderately well drained, on coastal plain terraces
Woodstown soils--are moderately well drained, on similar landforms
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage Class--Well drained
Surface Runoff--Low 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Class--Typically moderately high except where compacted.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for residential, commercial, and recreational applications in an urban setting. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Urban and other areas with human-modified landscapes of the Northern Coastal Plain; Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 149A. These soils are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 2023. 

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from a depth of 0 to 19 centimeters (^Au horizons)
Cambic horizons--the zone from a depth of 19 to 90 cm.
Redoximorphic features--Depletions with chroma 2 or less in the zone from a depth of 120 to 130 centimeters. 
Artifacts--the zone from a depth of 0 to 90 cm.
Human-transported materials--the zone from a depth of 0 to 90 cm.

The taxonomic classification will be revised to reflect the Thirteenth Edition Keys to Taxonomy (2022) when available in the National Soils Information System. Loamy-Skeletal, pauciartifactic, mixed, semiactive, mesic Anthroportic Dystrudepts.

Some pedons have redoximorphic features below a depth of 85 centimeters in the intact native subsoil and were included in the concept as this was related to the thickness of human-transported materials.
