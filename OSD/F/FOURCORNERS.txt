FOURCORNERS SERIES

The Fourcorners series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Fourcorners soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 4 to 30  percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  On Fourcorners extremely gravelly sandy loam, 4 to 30 percent slopes at an elevation of 2,050 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by approximately 60 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones.

    A -- 0 to 1 inch; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; noneffervescent; 60 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt -- 1 to 7 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) very gravelly sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots;  common fine, few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 70 percent faint discontinuous clay films on ped faces and distinct patchy clay films on sands and gravel; few distinct carbonate coats on lower surfaces of peds or rocks; slightly effervescent; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and trace of stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bkqm -- 7 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist.

TYPE LOCATION:  San Bernardino County, California; about 6 miles east and 3,500 feet north of the airfield base buildings at Bicycle Lake, Fort Irwin, California in an unsectionalized area; 6,400 feet north and 1,150 west of the northwest corner of section 1, T. 13 N., R. 4 E., 35 degrees, 16 minutes, 22 seconds north latitude and 116 degrees, 31 minutes, 16 seconds west longitude; Tiefort Mountains USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle; (UTM 11S, 0543548e 3903390n)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture control section: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following convection storms. The soils have a Typic-Aridic moisture regime.

Soil temperature: 66 to 72 degrees F.

Surface rock fragments: 50 to 65 percent gravel, 3 to 30 percent cobbles, and 2 to 10 percent stones.


Control section -

Depth to duripan: 7 to 14 inches

Rock fragments: range is from 40 to 55 percent; mostly gravel and cobbles

Clay content: 12 to 25 percent

Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline

Organic matter: 0 to 0.5 percent


A horizon
   Value: 5 to 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist 

   Chroma: 3 or 4 dry, and 3 to 6 moist

   Clay content: 8 to 12 percent

   Rock fragments: 35 to 85 percent; with 10 to 60 percent
   gravel, 2 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent
   stones

   Consistence: soft or slightly hard, very friable or
   friable

   Effervescence: noneffervescent to strongly effervescent

   Value: 5 or 6 dry, and 4 or 5 moist 

   Chroma: 4 to 6 dry, and 4 to 8 moist

   Texture of the fine earth: sandy loam, loam or sandy clay
   loam

   Rock fragments: 35 to 75 percent; with 15 to 50 percent
   gravel and 2 to 40 percent cobbles

   Consistence: slightly hard to hard, very friable to firm  

   Effervescence: noneffervescent to strongly effervescent

   Calcium carbonate equivalence: 0 to 1 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dedas (NV) and Peloncillo (AZ) series. Dedas soils have a thin duripan over bedrock. Bedrock is at a depth of 16 to 24 inches. Peloncillo soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative during July to September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fourcorners soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slope ranges from 4 to 30 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation occurs in winter but a significant portion is received between July and September following convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Dalvord, Goldroad, and Nellake soils. Arizo soils do not have an argillic horizon, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section, and are on inset fans and alluvial fans. Dalvord and Goldroad soils do not have an argillic horizon and are found on adjacent mountains. In addition, Goldroad soils have a hyperthermic soil temperature regime. Nellake soils are very deep and are found on similar landscapes and fan piedmonts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low to medium runoff; moderately rapid to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Fourcorners soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent in MLRA 30.
