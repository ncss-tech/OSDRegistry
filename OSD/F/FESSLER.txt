FESSLER SERIES 

The Fessler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from calcareous argillite.   These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fessler gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi-0 to 3 inches; slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A1--3 to 7 inches; black (10YR 2/1) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--13 to 32 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) very cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay flims on faces of peds and in pores; 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 19 inches thick) 

    Bt2--32 to 40 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very cobbly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots and few coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores and common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 14 inches thick) 

    Bk--40 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; lime disseminated; few fine filaments of lime; few faint coatings of lime on surface of coarse fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
