FLOUNDER SERIES

The Flounder series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in colluvium over glacial drift on coastal bluffs. Slopes range from 40 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 615 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, acid Typic Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Flounder highly organic silt loam, located on a bluff with a slope of 55 percent and elevation of 64 meters; when described on September 19th, 2007 the soil was moist throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 8 centimeters; slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and common coarse roots; extremely acid, pH 4.1; clear smooth boundary

 A--8 to 21 centimeters; very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) highly organic silt loam; 25 percent sand; 65 percent silt; 10 percent clay; weak medium granular structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and common coarse roots; extremely acid, pH 4.1; clear wavy boundary

 2Cg--21 to 183 centimeters; 85 percent gray (10YR 5/1) gravelly loam; 45 percent sand; 40 percent silt; 15 percent clay; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; 15 percent medium strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), moist, masses of oxidized iron with sharp boundaries; 25 percent nonflat 2 to 76 millimeter fragments; very strongly acid, pH 4.5
