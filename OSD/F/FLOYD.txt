FLOYD SERIES

The Floyd series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 75 to 150 centimeters of loamy sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are on concave foot slopes adjacent to upland drainageways on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters.

Clyde--are at slightly lower landscape positions in swales and upland drainageways and frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Kenyon--are at higher landscape positions on side slopes and interfluves and are frequently saturated at a depth of 1.2 meters during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Readlyn--are at landscape positions similar to those of the Floyd soils and have a moist bulk density of 1.75 to 1.9 g/cc within a depth of 75 centimeters

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.3 and 1 meter during April to June in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, both perched and apparent saturation can occur on this soil based on the season and intensity of rainfall during a given period of time

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Floyd County, Iowa, 1922.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 200 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 60 centimeters (A1 and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 60 to 200 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, 2Bw3, and 2BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 30 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
