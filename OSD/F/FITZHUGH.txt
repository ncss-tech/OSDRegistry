FITZHUGH SERIES

The Fitzhugh series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable upland soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone or sandstone conglomerate of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping or gently sloping convex uplands
in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Mean
annual precipitation is 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fitzhugh fine sandy loam--rangeland.
               (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

   A1--0 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine
sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 14 inches thick)

   B1--12 to 20 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

   B21t--20 to 36 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; nearly continuous clay films on faces of
peds; medium acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches
thick)

   B22t--36 to 45 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/8) clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry; common medium faint red (2.5YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure;
hard, firm; patchy clay films on faces of peds; common or many
fine iron-manganese concretions; medium acid; diffuse smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

   B3--45 to 55 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay loam,
yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky
structure; hard, firm; few fine iron-manganese concretions;
strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 18 inches thick)

   Cr--55 to 72 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) acid sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pontotoc County, Oklahoma; about 2 1/4 miles
south and 1/2 mile west of Roff; 2,490 feet east and 50 feet
north of the southwest corner of sec. 35, T. 2 N., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and
chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy
loam, or loam.  Reaction is medium or slightly acid.

The B1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and
chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay
loam.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.

The B2t and B3 horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to
5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of red or brown
in most pedons.  Texture and reaction is the same as the B1
horizon.

The Cr horizon consists of level bedded sandstone or sandstone conglomerate.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is Okay series in the same family.  Soils
in similar families are Bates, Catoosa, Claremore, Collinsville, Coweta, Lula, Mason, and Nowata series.  Okay soils have a solum
more than 60 inches thick.  Bates soils have siliceous mineralogy
and a solum 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone bedrock.
Catoosa, Lula, and Mason soils have a fine-silty control section.  Claremore, Collinsville, and Coweta soils have a solum less than
20 inches thick over bedrock.  In addition, Collinsville and
Coweta soils do not have argillic horizons and have siliceous mineralogy.  Nowata soils have a loamy-skeletal control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fitzhugh soils are on very gently sloping or gently sloping convex upland flats and side slopes in the
Cherokee Prairies.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  They formed in material weathered from sandstone or sandstone conglomerate of Pennsylvanian age.  The climate is subhumid or humid.  Mean
annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 45 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.   Thornthwaite annual
P-E indices range from 60 to 80.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bates, Collinsville, and Coweta series.  Bates soils occur on similar
areas of the landscape.  Collinsville and Coweta soils occur on ridgetops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated to wheat, peanuts,
soybeans, grain sorghum, and tame pasture.  Some areas are used
for range.  Native vegetation is mid and tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cherokee Prairies of eastern Oklahoma, southeast Kansas and northern Texas.  The series is not
extensive.
