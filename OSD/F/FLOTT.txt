FLOTT SERIES

The Flott series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till or colluvium derived from limestone or calcareous argillite.  These soils are on moraines, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Flott gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless other noted).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1987.  Flott is a coined name.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1043.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from 2 to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons); a mixed horizon from 20 to 25 inches (E/Bw horizon); calcic horizons from 25 to 60 inches (Bk horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches below the mineral soil surface (E, E/Bw, Bk1 horizons).  Flott soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
