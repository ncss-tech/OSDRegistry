FOURME SERIES

The Fourme series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, limestone, rhyolite and sandstone. Fourme soils are on fan remnants, stream terraces and outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fourme loam, - on a 1 percent, southwest-facing slope in rangeland at 1,993 meters elevation.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on October 10, 1979 the soil was moist below 38 cm.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt1--13 to 38 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; few faint clay films bridging sand grains; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6) gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--38 to 58 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular and tubular pores; few faint clay films bridging sand grains; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual wavy boundary.  

    Bt3--58 to 81 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few very fine irregular and tubular pores; few faint clay films bridging sand grains; 45 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 50 to 142 cm.)

    2C--81 to 152 cm; multicolored extremely gravelly sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boneyard, Chamberlain, Cowlow, Crandall, Forsey, Itwo, Jackflat, Packer, Scuffe, Stopatoe, Successloop (T), Tagum, Toquima, Winada and Zeebar series.  The Boneyard, Cowlow, Itwo, Scuffe, Stopatoe, Tagum, Toquima and Winada soils are 50 to 100 cm deep over a lithic or paralilthic contact.  Chamberlain soils have lime and silica cementation in the lower B horizon.  Crandall soils have calcium carbonate accumulations and are deep to bedrock.  Forsey soils have mean summer soil temperatures greater than 13.3 degrees C.  Jackflat soils are deep to bedrock.  Packer soils have a solum that is 23 to 53 cm thick.  Successloop soils have a mean summer soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C.  Zeebar soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days
