DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: the seasonal high water table is at a depth of 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 1 foot) during November to July in most years. In dry areas, the seasonal high water table is at a depth of 30 to 90 centimeters (1 to 3 feet) for brief periods in most years. 
Permeability:  very slow
Runoff:  very slow
Flooding: these soils are subject to rare or common flooding for brief periods. Flooding is limited where these soils are protected by dams or levees.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Forney soils are drained by surface ditches or land grading and are cropped to corn and soybeans. Native vegetation was grasses tolerant to wetness. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Forney soils are along the intermediate flood plains of the Missouri River Valley and its tributaries in the Major Land Resource Areas 102C (Loess Uplands) and 107B (Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills, South Part) within the Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region (Land Resource Region M). They are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Woodbury County, Iowa, 1971.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches - Cg1, Cg2, 2Ab, 2Bgb, 2BCgb horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches - Ap and A horizons)
Other features: aquic moisture regime.

Remarks: The structure in the C horizons is the result of the high clay content of the strata rather than pedogenesis.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
