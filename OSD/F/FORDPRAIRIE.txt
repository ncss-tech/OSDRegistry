4/2017--The Fordprairie series was proposed as a result of an update project. The official series description was developed according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation and laboratory sampling of the flood plains in MLRA 2 is recommended.
