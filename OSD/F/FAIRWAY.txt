FAIRWAY SERIES 

The Fairway series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, stream terraces, and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluvaquentic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Fairway silt loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, medium and coarse roots; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. 

    A--20 to 38 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons is 25 to 46 cm thick) 

    Bk--38 to 76 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; few thin grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) layers of soil, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; few fine threadlike and irregular calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 51 cm thick) 

    Bg--76 to 114 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; many fine and medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 61 cm thick) 

    2Cg--114 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; few fine and medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations, moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 7.2). (0 to 51 cm thick)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - flood plains, flood-plain steps, stream terraces, and drainageways

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability above the 2Cg horizon and very rapid permeability below. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Fairway soils are used mainly for irrigated crops, and some small areas are used for rangeland. Potential native vegetation is mainly reedgrass, western wheatgrass, slender wheatgrass, tufted hairgrass, basin wildrye, prairie cordgrass, sedges and forbs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Fairway soils are of moderate extent in western and central Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B, 46, 52, 58A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Choteau-Conrad Area, parts of Teton and Pondera Counties, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 38 cm (Ap and A horizons)
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - from 38 to 76 cm (Bk horizon)
Redox concentrations - from 76 to 152 cm (Bg and 2Cg horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity - at 114 cm (2Cg horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the A, Bk, and Bg horizons)

Fairway soils have a frigid temperature regime, an ustic moisture regime, and an aquic moisture subclass.

Redox depletions were not recorded at the type location in 1979. The need for documentation in support of the Fluvaquentic subgroup is recognized and should be investigated.
