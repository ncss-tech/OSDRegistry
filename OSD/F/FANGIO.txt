FANGIO SERIES

The Fangio series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed from mixed alluvium and colluvium of mostly granite, gneiss, and schist with fewer amounts of sedimentary rocks over residuum derived from shale on upper backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: The only known competitors are the Quagmeier and Tsezhin series.  Quagmeier soils are very deep to hard sandstone and limestone, have hues that are more yellow, and is in a slightly warmer climate.  Tsezhin soils do not have a paralithic contact within 80 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fangio soils are located on linear to slightly convex upper backslopes of eroded fan remnants nested on undulating plateaus.  They are formed in mixed alluvium mostly from Precambrian Age granite, gneiss, and schist with minor amounts of localized Triassic Age sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from shale.  They are on slopes of 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6,600 to 8,000 feet, mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 48 degrees, and mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 14 to 16 inches with the peak periods occurring from July through September and December through March. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altega, Ortiz, and Predawn soils. Altega soils are fine-loamy, do not have a calcic horizon, and are on fan aprons. Ortiz soils are fine, do not have a calcic horizon, and are on lower backslopes of eroded fan remnants. Predawn soils are fine-loamy, have an abrupt textural change to the argillic horizon, and are on summits of eroded fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Fangio soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is blue grama, plains pricklypear, walkingstick cholla, oneseed juniper, twoneedle pion, and galleta. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Fangio soils are of small extent on the northern Glorieta Slope part of the Pecos Valley section of the Great Plains physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 70A.
