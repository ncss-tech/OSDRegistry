MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Patrick County, Virginia, 2008.

REMARKS: Fairystone soils were previously mapped as inclusions in Littlejoe, Buffstat, and Bugley soils. These soils have relatively thin argillic horizons, many less than 10 inches thick. They are tentatively classified as Typic Hapludults; however, the type location is borderline to Inceptic Hapludults. Additional investigation is needed to accurately determine the predominance of the argillic horizon thickness and a new type location may be needed. Levels of total carbon are high due to the influence of graphitic parent materials; however organic matter from plant residue is thought to be similar to adjacent soils. Where Cr layers are present, fracture intervals are too close to qualify for paralithic contact.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 5 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from about 7 to 17 inches (Mid and lower BAt horizon and Bt horizon)
Lithic contact--hard bedrock contact at 31 inches (R horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 31 inches
