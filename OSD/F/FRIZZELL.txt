FRIZZELL SERIES

The Frizzell series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained,
slowly permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping terraces of mid-Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, siliceous, active, thermic Glossaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Frizzel silt loam--forest.
           (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, weak fine
granular structure; friable; many fine roots; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

     B/E--2 to 35 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam (B); common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and few fine faint yellowish brown mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many fine pores; 10 to 15
percent of horizon is interfingers of light brownish gray (10YR
6/2) silt loam (E), in streaks and spots 3 to 15 mm thick; few fine black concretions, very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (20
to 54 inches thick)

     Bt1--35 to 43 inches; mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) 55 percent, and gray (10YR 6/1) 45 percent, silt loam; few medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few fine black concretions; few patchy clay films on faces of peds; continuous
clay films on root channels; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick)

     Bt2--43 to 56 inches; mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) 55 percent and gray (10YR 6/1) 45 percent, silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine pores; clay films continuous on faces of peds; few medium brown concretions;
very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

     Bt3--56 to 76 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; many distinct pale brown (10YR 6/3), and few medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine pores; few clay films on faces of
peds and in pores; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (15
to 25 inches thick)

     C--76 to 85 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay
loam; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2)
mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; very
strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Ouachita Parish, Louisiana; 3.5 miles east of Fairbanks, 250 feet north of center of Louisiana Highway 134; SE1/4SW1/4 sec. 5, T, 19 N., R. 5 E; 2,650 feet east of west side
of section and 250 feet north of south section line.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to 80 inches.
The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout except
for surface layers that have been limed.  Base saturation of the lower Bt horizon is 35 to 60 percent.

The A1 horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown
(10YR 4/2), or brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3) silt loam or loam.

The B horizon part of the B/E horizon is pale brown (10YR
6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), brown (10YR 5/3), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), silt loam or loam with common to many mottles in shades of gray or grayish brown.  The E horizon
part of the B and A horizon consists of streaks or spots, of interfingers of less clayey material that is pale brown (10YR
6/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/2) and makes up 5 to 15 percent of the horizon.

The Bt horizon is brown (10YR 4/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4,
5/6), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottled with shades of gray.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  Sand content in the B horizon which is dominantly very fine averages 10
to about 30 percent.

The C horizon is yellowish brown or gray silt loam, silty clay
loam, loam, or clay loam that contains few to many grayish
mottles.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Series
in related families are the Beauregard, Bude, Calloway, Center, Coteau, Falkner, Goldman, Longview, Muskogee, Tippo, Tutwiler, and Vidrine series.  Beauregard soils have more than 5 percent
plinthite, base saturation below 35 percent, and more than 18
percent clay in the upper B horizon.  Bude and Calloway soils are bisequal with a fragipan in the lower B horizon.  Center soils
lack thick B and A horizons, have higher base status, and contain less sand.  Coteau and Longview soils have fine-silty control sections.  Goldman soils lack the thick B and A horizons and have over 60 percent base saturation.  Tippo soils lack the thick B and
A horizons and have a weakly expressed fragipan.  Tutwiler soils
lack the thick B and A horizons, have over 60 percent base
saturation and lack low chromas in the upper argillic horizon.  Muskogee and Falkner soils lack thick B and A horizons and have higher clay content in the upper B horizon.  Vidrine soils have coarse-silty over clayey control sections.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frizzell soils occur on nearly level to very gently sloping mid-Pleistocene terraces.  The soil formed in silty alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to about 3 percent.  The climate is warm and humid with a rainfall of 53 inches and mean annual temperature of 65 degrees F., near the type location.  P-E index
is 68 to 74.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Providence and Guyton series.  Frizzell soils are not as gray as Guyton soils and lack the brittle fragipan of Providence soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all of this soil is in woodland,
mainly oak and pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Louisiana and Arkansas.  The series is
of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 2 inches (the A horizon.)

Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 35 inches to a depth of 76 inches (the BH, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons.)

Glossic properties - albic materials extending as interfingers into the B horizon, (the E part of the B/E horizon.)
