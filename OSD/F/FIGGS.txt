GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Coards soils (tentative)--fine-silty soils formed in mixed fluvial and lagoonal sediments on fluviomarine bottoms.
Cottman soils (tentative)-coarse-loamy soils formed in lagoon bottom sediments on barrier island side
Sinepuxent soils (tentative)--coarse-loamy soils formed in dredged lagoonal sediments.
Southpoint soils (tentative)--fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments, relict marsh sediments, and upland subaerial soils on mainland coves and submerged wave-cut headlands.
Tingles soils (tentative)--fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments on lagoon bottoms.
Truitt soils (tentative)--fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments over buried organic horizons that formed at or near sea level when it was at a lower elevation on submerged wave-cut headlands or mainland coves.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous drainage and peraquic soil moisture regime.
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Low to moderately high

Soil is permanently submerged with salt or brackish water. The presence of sulfidic material within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for acid sulfate drainage if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for human recreation and benthic habitats as a source for food, shelter, and other essential life support.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and possibly Virginia.  This series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES PROPOSED:  Worcester County, Maryland, 2007.

Remarks: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
Peraquic feature - Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (Under 130 cm of salt water).
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Part of the 2Cg horizon).
Sulfidic materials - within 50 cm of the soil surface (the Ase1, Ase2 and 2Cseg horizon).
