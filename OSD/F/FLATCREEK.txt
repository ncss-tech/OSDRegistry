FLATCREEK SERIES

The Flatcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, frigid Vertic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Flatcreek silty clay, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and very fine roots and few medium roots; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    By--3 to 11 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium and coarse subangular blocky; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; few fine masses of gypsum; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Byz--11 to 20 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few pressure faces; few fine masses of gypsum and other salts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

    BCyz1--20 to 43 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) stratified clay and silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common fine masses of gypsum and other salts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (16 to 30 inches thick)

    BCyz2--43 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) stratified clay and silty clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; few fine faint light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) mottles; massive; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine tubular pores; few fine masses of gypsum and other salts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Chouteau County, Montana, 1992.  Series name is from a stream in south-central Chouteau County.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1346.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon form 0 to 3 inches (A horizon); a horizon of gypsum accumulation (By horizon); horizons of accumulations of gypsum and other salts (BCyz1 and BCyz2 horizons); and a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches.  Flatcreek soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aquic.
