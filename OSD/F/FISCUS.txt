REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Andic soil properties--zone from 3 to 74 cm
*Argillic horizon--zone from 74 to 170 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 3 to 104 cm; ashy in zone from 3 to 38 cm, ashy-skeletal in zone from 38 to 74 cm, and loamy-skeletal in zone from 74 to 104 cm
*Alfic subgroup feature--argillic horizon at a depth of 74 cm

1/2000--Classification changed from mixed mineralogy to glassy over isotic.

More investigation is needed to determine whether or not the Fiscus series is in the udic soil moisture regime based on the presence of Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and twinflower. If the soils are udic, they are similar to the soils of the Twolakes series.
