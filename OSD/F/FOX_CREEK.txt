COMPETING SERIES: 
Tumagan soils-found in more saline waters of coastal bays and lagoons within the Northern Tidewater Area.  Does not have buried argillic horizons within 200 cm.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape:  Northern Coastal Plain estuaries
Landform:  Permanently submerged tidal marshes and submerged wave-cut platforms
Parent Material:  herbaceous organic materials over glauconitic fluviomarine deposits
Slope:  0 to 3 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature:  50 to 59 degrees F. (10 to 15 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Water Depth Range:  0 to 3.3 feet (0 to 1 meters)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Contees Wharf soils-occur in estuarine tidal stream landforms, have a fine-silty family class, and do not contain organic horizons within the upper 200 cm.
Muddy Creek soils- occur on estuarine tidal stream channels, have a fine-silty family class, and do not have organic horizons 40 centimeters thick within 40 centimeters of the soil surface
Sellman soils- occur on mainland cove and estuarine tidal stream channels, have a fine family class, and do not contain organic horizons within upper 200 cm.   

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous drainage
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Moderately high to very high
Soil Moisture Regime:  Peraquic
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water.  The presence of hyper-sulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air. 

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses:  Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing and boating. These are nearshore areas that may be developed as marinas or with private docks. 
Dominant Vegetation:  Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain sub-estuaries of the western portion of the Chesapeake Bay.  MLRA 149A.  This series is of small extent. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2018. 

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is named for Fox Creek, which is a tributary to the Rhode River sub estuary of Chesapeake Bay.  Areas of mapping were formerly included with water.
