FRANKIRK SERIES

The Frankirk series comprises very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Quaternary age. These soils occur on gently sloping terraces on dissected plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Abilene, Aspermont, Bukreek, Miles, Rotan, and Sagerton series.
Abilene and Sagerton soils: occur on similar positions with secondary carbonates at less than 71 cm (28 in) and have a calcic horizon at less than 152 cm (60 in) depths.
Aspermont soils: do not have a mollic epipedon or an argillic horizon and occur on higher positions.
Bukreek and Miles soils: have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and occur on similar positions.
Rotan soils: have secondary carbonates within 71 cm (28 in) of the surface and occur on similar or slightly lower positions with slopes mainly less than 1 percent.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow and slow. Runoff is low on slopes of less than 1 percent and medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major use is crop production.  Wheat, cotton, and grain sorghum are the principle crops.  The native plant community is mixed grasses and main species are buffalograss, blue grama, sideoats grama and silver bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Plains, Western and Eastern Parts (MLRA 78B, 78C) of Texas and Oklahoma.  This series is of moderate extent (MLRA 78B, 78C) of Texas and Oklahoma.  The series has moderate extent.
