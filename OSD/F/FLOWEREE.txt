FLOWEREE SERIES 

The Floweree series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, glacial meltwater deposits or in eolian deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, till plains, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Floweree soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Elevations are 1,900 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, glacial meltwater deposits, and in eolian deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and early, hot and dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches most of which falls as rain in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cambeth, Lambeth, Lonna and Vanstel soils.  These soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, Cambeth soils have a calcic horizon and Vanstel soils have an agrillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; negligible to medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Floweree soils are used mainly for irrigated crops and dry farmed crops.  Some areas are used for range.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread and some forbs and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Floweree soils are of moderate extent in Montana, east of the Rocky Mountains.
