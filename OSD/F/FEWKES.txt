FEWKES SERIES

The Fewkes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, residuum, and colluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone and shale.  Fewkes soils are on hills, fan remnants and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fewkes gravelly loam on a north facing convex, 40 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6,400 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 30, 1974, the soil was dry throughout.

    A--0 to 12 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots, common fine and few medium roots; common very fine pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary (10 to 20 inches thick). 

    Bt1--12 to 17 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

    Bt2--17 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary(5 to 10 inches thick).

    Btk2--28 to 40 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated and in thin veins; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary (0 to 15 inches thick).

    Bk1--40 to 50 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated and veined on faces of peds; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary (8 to 20 inches thick).

    Bk2--50 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; carbonates are segregated and veined on faces of peds; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).
