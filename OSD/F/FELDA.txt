FELDA SERIES

The Felda series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy marine deposits. Felda soils are on flatwoods, low broad flats, drainageways, sloughs, depressions, and flood plains. Slopes are linear to concave and range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, superactive, hyperthermic Arenic Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Felda fine sand, on a linear to slightly concave native grass prairie at elevation of about 4 meters (14 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil).

     Eg--10 to 89 centimeters (4 to 35 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand; single grain; loose; many fine roots; many medium distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) masses of iron-manganese accumulation; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [43 to 81 centimeters (17 to 32 inches) thick] 

     Btg--89 to 109 centimeters (35 to 43 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of some peds; many medium distinct olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) masses of iron-manganese accumulation; neutral; gradual irregular boundary.
