FUBBLE SERIES

The Fubble series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from metamorphic rocks. Fubble soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fubble very gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered by approximately 3 percent stones and 10 percent cobbles.

    A1--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine and fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 3 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

    Bt1--10  to 20 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films bridging sand grains; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt2--20 to 36 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films bridging sand grains; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bk--36 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common fine seams of lime; 20 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

    R--48 cm; hard metamorphic rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Churchill County, Nevada; about 30 miles southeast of Fallon in the Sand Springs Range; 800 feet east and 900 feet north of the projected southwest corner of section 28, T. 15 N., R. 32 E.; USGS Fourmile Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 7 minutes 59.4 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees 23 minutes 11.3 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.1331667 latitude, -118.386472 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and autumn; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Soil temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm to a lithic contact.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 25 to 35 percent. 
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent and predominantly pebbles, lithology of fragments is mainly metamorphosed volcanic rocks such as metarhyolite and metatuff.

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bt horizons
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Structure: Weak prismatic or moderate fine and medium subangular blocky.
Reaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.

Bk horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist.
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, predominantly gravel.
Reaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Banbury, Bombadil, Dougal, Jaybee, Kreza, Meninik and Stumount series. Banbury soils do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon and may have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Bombadil and Stumount soils have bedrock at depth of 18 to 36 cm and do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon.  Dougal soils have bedrock at 18 to 40 cm, do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon, and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Jaybee soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in some part of the argillic horizon. Kresa soils have bedrock at 10 to 25 cm, do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon, and have 15 to 30 percent soft, platy fragments of schist. Meninik soils do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fubble soils are on mountains.  They formed in residuum derived from metamorphic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,676 to 2,164 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Nicanor soil.  Nicanor soils are loamy, very shallow and shallow to bedrock, have ochric epipedons, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff and moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Fubble soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Indian ricegrass, Thurber needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and pine bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 27.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Churchill County Area, Nevada, 1995.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
