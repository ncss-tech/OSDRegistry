FLAGWELL SERIES

The Flagwell series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in deposits derived from benmoreite or dacite. Flagwell soils are on residuum. Slopes range from 2 to 34 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Flagwell-Arboretum complex (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 3 inches (0 to 7 cm); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and common medium tubular pores; many fine and common medium roots throughout; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary

     Bt1--3 to 6 inches (7 to 15 cm); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine tubular pores; many fine and common medium roots throughout; 25 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral, (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary

     Bt2--6 to 12 inches (15 to 31 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine tubular pores; many fine and common medium coarse, and very coarse roots throughout; 10 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary

     BC--12 to 19 inches (31 to 49 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; structureless massive; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine tubular pores; common fine, coarse and very coarse roots throughout; 2 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual smooth boundary

     Cr1--19 to 39 inches (49 to 99 cm); soft paralithic bedrock

     Cr2--39 to 49 inches (99 to 124 cm); moderately hard paralithic bedrock

COMPETING SERIES: These are Glenham, Gosper, Hennings, Houdek, Ree, Reventon, Verdigre, and Wewela.  Glenham, Gosper, Hennings, Houdek, Ree, Verdigre, and Wewela are South Dakota and Nebraska soils that are substantially wetter in Spring months.  Reventon is a deep soil in alluvium.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum from benmoreite or dacite
Landform: lava fields
Slopes: 2 to 35 percent
Elevation: 6,300 to 7,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 49 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 18 to 22 inches
Precipitation peaks in July and August, and in winter months.  May and June are much drier.
Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arboretum, Pluto, Purpleheart, and Procky soils. Arboretum soils are derived from benmoreite alluvium.  Pluto, Purpleheart and Procky soils are in basalt lava flows.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as grazing land. Native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Arizona fescue, pine dropseed, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. MLRA 39.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Coconino County, Arizona.
