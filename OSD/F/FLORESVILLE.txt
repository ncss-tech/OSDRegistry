FLORESVILLE SERIES

The Floresville series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium and/or residuum dervived from sandstone of Tertiary age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on broad interfluves or ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 736 mm (29 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).
