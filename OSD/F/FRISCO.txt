FRISCO SERIES 

The Frisco series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, till, slope alluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on mountain slopes, moraines, dip slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.1 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Eutric Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Frisco sandy loam - forested, on a 25 to 65 percent slope.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Oi--0 to 2.5 cm; undecomposed needles, bark, and twigs. 

    Oe--2.5 to 8 cm; partially decomposed organic materials, principally needles, bark and twigs. 

    E--8 to 48 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary. (30 to 61 cm thick) 

    Bt1--48 to 130 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very stony sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; less than 5 percent very pale brown (10YR 7/3) uncoated sand grains on peds; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; faint patchy clay films on ped faces and on surfaces along root channels; 60 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 81 cm thick) 

    Bt2--130 to 160 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very stony sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; strong and moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; faint nearly continuous clay films on ped faces and on surfaces along root channels and pores; 60 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 76 cm thick) 

    Bt3--160 to 178 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very stony sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; faint patchy clay films on ped faces; 60 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick) 

    C--178 to 211 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very stony sandy clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; 60 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
