FOXLAKE SERIES

The Foxlake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in glacial till on ground moraines and lake plains.  These soils have slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Epiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Foxlake silty clay loam on a southwest facing slope of 1 percent under prairie grass.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

    Ap--0 to 10 inches; black (N 2/0) silty clay loam, very dark gray (N 3/0) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; about 1 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

    A--10 to 19 inches; black (N 2/0) silty clay loam, very dark gray (N 3/0) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; about 1 percent gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 24 inches).

    Bg--19 to 38 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; about 2 percent gravel; few light gray (10YR 7/2) segregated lime in filaments and threads; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 30 inches thick)

    Bkg--38 to 49 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) silty clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm;  common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations;  about 2 percent gravel; common light gray (10YR 7/2) segregated lime in filaments and threads; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bkg horizon is 20 to 40 inches)

    Cg--49 to 80 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) silty clay loam; massive; firm; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations; about 2 percent gravel; few light gray (10YR 7/2) segregated lime in filaments and threads; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Becker County, Minnesota; about 1 mile east and one-half mile north of Audubon; 1500 feet north and 2600 feet west of the southeast corner, sec. 11, T.139N., R.42W; USGS Audubon quadrangle, Lat.  46 degrees 51 minutes 58 seconds N. and Lon. 95 degrees 57 minutes 10 seconds W., NAD27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise 1 to 4 percent by volume of all horizons.  The sand content is 5 to 25 percent and the clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam or silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.

The Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

The Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dimmick and Fulda series.  Both of these series do not have rock fragments in the series controls section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes with gradients of 0 to 2 percent on ground moraines and lake plains.  They formed in glacial till.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 130.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Audubon, Boyerlake, Hattie and Dovray soils which are members of a hydrosequence.  The moderately well drained Audubon, Boyerlake and Hattie soils are on higher lying positions.  The very poorly drained Dovray soils are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Surface runoff and permeability is slow.  A perched water table occurs at a depth of .5 to 1.5 feet at some time from October to June in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is cultivated.  Wheat, barley, and soybeans are the principal crops.  Native vegetation ia tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Minnesota.  Inextensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Becker County, Minnesota, 1994.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features identified in this soil are: Mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 19 inches (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon--the zone from 19 to 49 inches (Bg and Bkg horizons); aquic moisture condition based on low chroma matrix below the mollic epipedon.  This soil could be challenged for an Epiaquert.  It is marginal to the Vertisol order and was felt that the current classification was more appropriate at this time.
