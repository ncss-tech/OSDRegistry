FLEER SERIES

Typically, Fleer soils have gray, mottled A horizons about 30 inches thick, over noncontrasting very gravelly loamy sand or sand IICg horizons at a depth of 30 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous Cumulic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fleer loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    O1--2 to 0 inches; undecomposed organic materials, mainly grass roots and remains.

    A11--0 to 11 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2) clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    A12g--11 to 30 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky; nonplastic; common medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 3/4) mottles; calcareous, moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 34 inches thick)

    IICg--30 to 60 inches; very gravelly loamy sand or sand, many large prominent mottles, reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; calcareous.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Colorado; 1/8 mile north of S 1/4 corner of Sec. 34, T. 9 N., R. 79 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 21 to 40 inches thick and usually extends to the substratum, although in some pedons mottled B2 horizons of low chroma occur between the mollic epipedon and the IIC horizon.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges fro 0 to 10 inches.  Depth to lithic contact or a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the IICg horizon ranges from 26 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the control section is typically sandy loam but averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the upper part of the control section and average less than 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  They are mainly less than 10 inches in diameter.

The A2 horizon ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.

The B2 horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Debrow, Mendenhall, and Tepee series.  Debrow soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Mendenhall soils are sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam throughout the 10 to 40 inch section.  Tepee soils have a fine-loamy control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fleer soils are on flood plains and low terraces.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 6 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse alluvial sediments that are underlain by beds of sand and gravel.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 37 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 57 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Debrow and Mendenhall soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.  These soils have water tables that stand at or near the surface during most of the year.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as native pastureland or for native hay meadows.  Principal native vegetation is wiregrass, sedges, redtop, and willows.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High mountain valleys of north-central Colorado.  The series is of small extent.

REMARKS:  Last updated by the State 10/73.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.
