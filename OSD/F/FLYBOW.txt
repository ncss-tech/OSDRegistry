FLYBOW SERIES

The Flybow series consists of very shallow, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in material weathered from basalt and greenstone. Flybow soils have slopes that range from 4 to 100 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Lithic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Flybow extremely cobbly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 5 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 40 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

   R--5 inches; fractured basalt with soil material between fractures; few roots.

TYPE LOCATION: Idaho County, Idaho; 500 feet east and 70 feet north of the southwest corner of the southeast 1/4 of section 2, T. 29 N., R. 2 W.
 
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to bedrock - 4 to 10 inches 
Average annual soil temperature - 47 to 54 degrees F. 
Average summer soil temperature - 65 to 70 degrees F. 
Moisture control section - dry 45 to 90 days in summer

Particle-size control section (weighted averages): 
clay content - 8 to 25 percent 
rock fragment content - 35 to 75 percent with less than 45 percent stones
 
A horizon 
Hue - 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value - 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma - 2 through 6, dry or moist 
Organic matter content - less than 1 percent 
Reaction - moderately acid through neutral
 
COMPETING SERIES: This is the Randcore series. Randcore soils have 45 to 70 percent stones and are moderately well drained due to being saturated with water in winter. Etsel soils are similar, but are dry greater than 90 days (from June until sometime in October) and have a CEC to clay ratio of 0.4 to 0.6 percent (active class).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Flybow soils are moderately sloping to steep on intermound areas of hills, plateaus, and structural benches and steep to very steep on mountain slopes and canyon walls. Slopes range from 4 to 100 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and greenstone. The elevation ranges from 800 to 6,210 feet. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 26 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ferdinand, Bluesprin, and Riggins soils. Ferdinand and Bluesprin soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have an argillic horizon. Riggins soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The natural vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, cutleaf balsamroot, phlox, biscuitroot, wild onion, penstemon, and eriogonum.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho and northeastern Oregon. MLRA 10 and 9. The Flybow soils are moderately extensive.
