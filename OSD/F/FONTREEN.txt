FONTREEN SERIES

The Fontreen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, chert, and shale. Fontreen soils are on alluvial fans, hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Canyonfork, Cavehill, Cedarcabin, Granzan, Highup, Lizdale, Lizzant, Lonjon, and Sylvaniam series. 

Canyonfork soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Cavehill, Cedarcabin, Highup, Lonjon, and Sylvaniam soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm.  Granzan soils have bedrock at 100 to 150 cm. Lizdale soils are somewhat excessively drained, have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and extremely gravelly loamy sand C horizons. Lizzant soils have cambic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fontreen soils are on moderately sloping to steep alluvial fans and fan remnants and on steep to very steep hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,585 to 2,500 meters. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. They formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from limestone, sandstone, chert and shale. The climate is dry subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 400 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. Freeze-free period is commonly 70 to 110 days, but higher elevations have shorter freeze-free periods.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amtoft, Atepic, Borvant, Clegg, Deer Creek, Lodar, Lundy, Mower, Sanpete and Wales soils. Amtoft, Atepic, Lodar and Lundy soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 50 cm. Borvant soils have a petrocalcic horizon within 50 cm. Clegg and Deer Creek soils have argillic horizons. Mower soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Sanpete and Wales soils lack mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately or moderately rapid permeability; moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used as livestock grazing. Potential vegetation is juniper, pinion, Mormon-tea, birchleaf mountain mahogany, bluebunch wheatgrass and Indian ricegrass.  These soils are correlated to Upland ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and western Utah. MLRA 28A, 34A. The series is moderately extensive, with 54,350 acres mapped to date.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 38 cm. (A, Ak1, Ak2 horizons)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 38 to 145 cm. (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, Bk4 horizons)
Carbonatic feature: The fine earth fraction averages more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bk1, Bk2 and part of Ak2 and Bk3 horizons).

This series was reclassified in 9/94 from an Aridic Calcixerolls to a Typic Calcixerolls to better represent the 12 to 16 inch precipitation and upland range sites.
