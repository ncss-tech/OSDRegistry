FRAJILLO SERIES

The Frajillo series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to sandstone bedrock. Frajillo soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale. They are on shoulders and backslopes on interfluves of undulating plains and on summits of structural benches. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Frajillo sandy loam--on a shoulder of an undulating plateau sloping 5 percent to the south at 6,935 feet elevation--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on September 9th, 2002, the soil was moist from 0 to 6 inches and otherwise dry throughout.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few medium, few fine, and few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

(2 to 8 inches thick)

    2Btk3--10 to 13 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3) paragravelly sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent paragravel; violently effervescent, secondary calcium carbonate segregated as common fine irregularly shaped accumulations on faces of peds (3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    2R--13 to 23 inches; strongly cemented sandstone bedrock.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is intermittently moist in some part from July to October and December to March. It is assumed to be dry in all parts 50 to 75 percent of the time (cumulative), when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or higher. The soils are driest in May and June. The soil moisture regime is ustic aridic.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bernal, Joachem and Margosa series. Bernal, Joachem, and Margosa soils are in the aridic ustic moisture regime. The Frajillo series is in the ustic aridic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frajillo soils are on shoulders and backslopes on interfluves of undulating plains and on summits of structural benches.  They formed in eolian material and residuum derived from sandstone and shale of the. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arojomil, Clovis, Ildefonso, Kinsell, and Palabria soils. Arojomil soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Clovis soils have a calcic horizon and occur on backslopes and footslopes. Ildefonso soils are loamy-skeletal, have a calcic horizon, and occur on shoulders and backslopes. Kinsell soils are fine-silty, have a mollic epipedon, and occur on floodplains and channels of valley floors. Palabria soils are deep, have a calcic horizon, and occur on structural benches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Frajillo soils are used for livestock grazing and recreation. Present vegetation is New Mexico feathergrass, black grama, blue grama, bud sagebrush, Bigelow sagebrush, Bigelow rubber rabbitbrush, and buckwheat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Frajillo soils are of small extent in the northeastern part of the Estancia Basin in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico, MLRA 70C.
