FREEPORT SERIES

The Freeport series consists of very deep, poorly drained, low saturated hydraulic conductivity (very slowly permeable) soils that formed in eolian deposits over loamy and clayey fluviomarine deposits. These nearly level soils occur on tidal flats on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:
This is the Karankawa and Ostermayer series in the same family. Similar soils are Nass, Madre, Mustang, Satatton, and Tatton series.
Karankawa soils submerged for longer periods; have mucky surface texture.
Nass soils: very poorly drained; have electrical conductivity values less than 25 dS/m throughout.

Mean annual precipitation: 1143 to 1295 mm (45 to 51 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 20.6 to 21.7 C (69 to 71 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 275 to 300 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Brazosport Galveston, Karankawa, and and Ostermayerseries.
Galveston soils: are on a back-barrier flat landform
Karankawa soils: on a submerged tidal flat
Brazosport soils: are remnant back-barrier flats
Ostermayer soils: are same landform but do not have vegetation

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: poor 
Permeability class: very slow (low saturated hydraulic conductivity)
Runoff: high 
Flooding:  frequent frequency from daily tides, for very brief (4 to 48 hours) duration
Seasonal water table: Endosaturation occurs from near the surface to 2 m (0 to 8 feet throughout the year. As high tides recede, these areas remain saturated throughout. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: wildlife habitat
Native vegetation: saltflat grass and salicornia and other salt tolerant vegetation  
Ecological sites assigned to phases and components of this series are listed below. Current ecological site assignments are in Web Soil Survey. Components of this series include the following ecological sites: Salt Flat (R150BY651TX)

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area: The upper Texas Gulf Coast mostly on Galveston and Follets Island

Extent: small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Galveston County, Texas, 2020. The name is from a municipality near the type location.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Mustang series. The series was separated based on differences in water table depth and salinity.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 21 cm (0 to 8 in) (Ag horizon) 
Endosaturation and aquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) (Ag, Cg1, Cg2,2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: 128 to 203 cm (50 to 80 in). 

Additional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity is evident as an increase in clay due to the Beaumont Formation and ancient Brazos River. This paleo-surface is deeper in pedons on Galveston Island and shallower on the southwest end of Follets Island. Some areas are firm enough during low tide to allow light vehicular traffic.

ADDITIONAL DATA: MLRA Soil Survey Office data are available on S2020TX0397032 at the series type location.
