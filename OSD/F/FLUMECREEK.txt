FLUMECREEK SERIES

The Flumecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material from quartzite  with a thick mantle of volcanic ash located on mountain slopes. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 42 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flumecreek soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 3,600 to 5,000 feet with slopes ranging from 15 to 65 percent. These soils are formed in quartzite colluvium and residuum with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The frost-free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Berthahill, Handoff, and the Township series. Berthahill and Handoff soils are on mountain slopes and have cryic soil temperature regimes. Township soils are on mountain slopes, are paramicaceous and lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is grand fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce with an understory of queencup beadlily, bunchberry dogwood, western goldenthread, coolwort foamflower, mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, common snowberry, big blueberry, American trailplant, princes pine, northern bedstraw, and common pink wintergreen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Idaho. Flumecreek soils are not extensive.
