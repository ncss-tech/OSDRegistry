FUSULINA SERIES

The Fusulina series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed residuum derived from shale. Fuusulina soils are on mountains. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, shallow Xeric Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Fusulina channery loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent shale fragments; neutral (pH 7 0); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

     A2--5 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, and few fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent shale fragments; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt irregular boundary. (10 to 46 cm thick)

     Cr--30 to 64 cm; tilted shale bedrock (Chainman Formation), with a hardness of less than 3.

TYPE LOCATION: Eureka County, Nevada; 650 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 13, T. 19 N., R. 54 E.; USGS Diamond Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 30 minutes 35 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 50 minutes 8 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5094444 latitude, -115.8355556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring and continuously dry in all parts for significant periods in summer and fall; xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 13 to 15 degrees C.
Paralithic contact: 15 to 40 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent channers. 

A horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 through 4. 
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard when dry, 
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Fusuvar series. Fusuvar soils are intermittently moist due to convection storms.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fusulina soils are on mountain slopes. Elevations are 2,140 to 3,050 meters. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent. The soils formed in residuum derived from shale (Chainman Formation) in a cool, continental climate having a mean annual precipitation of 300 to 460 mm which comes mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season is less than 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Artypa, Bartine, Croesus, and Sheege soils. Artypa, Bartine, and Croesus soils have are moderately deep to bedrock Sheege soils are calcareous and have lithic contacts to limestone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; rapid runoff; moderate permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat is the principal use. Vegetation is big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada. They are moderately extensive. MLRA 28B.
