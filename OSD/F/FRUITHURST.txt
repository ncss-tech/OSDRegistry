FRUITHURST SERIES

The Fruithurst series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from serecite schist, phyllite or other fine-grained metamorphic rock. These soils are on sloping to steep uplands of the Piedmont Plateau. Water runs off the surface medium to rapidly depending on slope and vegetation cover. Slopes range from 6 to 35 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludults 

TYPICAL PEDON: Fruithurst loam, on a convex 10 percent slope in forest. (Colors are for moist soil.) 

 A--0 to 5 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam; weak medium granular structure; friable; many fine and medium and few large roots; few quartz and slate fragments; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

 BE--5 to 10 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine pores; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

 Bt1--10 to 18 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; diffuse wavy boundary. 

 Bt2--18 to 29 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; common fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid; gradual irregular boundary. 

 Bt3--29 to 39 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine medium roots; common fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; thin lenses with relict rock structure; very strongly acid; gradual irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 10 to 35 inches.) 

 Cr--39 to 60 inches; highly weathered serecite schist, phyllite or other fine-grained metamorphic rock with relict rock structure; very strongly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION: Cleburne County, Alabama; approximately 2 miles north-northeast of Arbocoochee in the NW1/4SE1/4 sec. 29, T. 16 S., R. 11 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact (Cr) range from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. Content of gravel-size quartz or schist fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A, E and BE horizons, and from 0 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid except where limed. 

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

The E or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. It is clay loam, loam, or silt loam with more than 30 percent silt in the control section. In most pedons clay content increases with depth and the Bt horizon becomes redder with depth. 

The Cr horizon is multicolored, highly weathered loamy serecite schist, phyllite or other fine-grained metamorphic rock saprolite with relict rock structure. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are Cheaha, Montonia(T), Rion, Rome, Shady Sherless, Sherwood, State, Sugargrove, Tidings, and Wickham series. Cheaha soils have hard sandstone bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Montonia soils have hard schist bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Rion soils have bedrock at a depth of more than 60 inches. Rome, Shady, State, and Wickham soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces and have thicker sola. Sherless soils have Cr horizons of Mississippian shale and sandstone. Sherwood soils have hard Pennsylvanian sandstone bedrock at a depth of 30 to 60 inches. Sugargrove and Tidings soils have Cr horizons of sandstone and shale at depths of 40 to 60 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fruithurst soils are on sloping to steep uplands. Slope gradients are between 6 and 35 percent. These soils developed in residuum weathered from serecite schist, phyllite or other fine-grained metamorphic rock. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is 59 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 53 inches. The average frost-free growing season is 225 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Badin, Tallapoosa and Tatum series. Tallapoosa soils have a solum thickness of less than 20 inches. Tatum soils have Cr at a depth of 40 to 60 inches, are in a fine family, and have Bt horizons that have hues of 2.5YR or 10R. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate to rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of Fruithurst soils are in forests of loblolly, shortleaf, and longleaf pine and oaks. Cleared areas are used primarily for pasture and hay. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Piedmont Plateau of Alabama, and possibly in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. The series is of moderate extent.
