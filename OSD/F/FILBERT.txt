FILBERT SERIES


The Filbert series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in loess. They are in open depressions (see remarks) on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, at the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the:
Fillmore soils pond water for short duration.
Scott soils occur in enclosed depressions and are ponded for long or very long duration.
Tomek(P) soils are well drained, contain less clay in the argillic horizon and do not occur in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Somewhat poorly drained. 
Permeability: Very slow. 
Runoff: Slow. 
Note: These soils are saturated for brief duration during the growing season from a perched water table that ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Filbert soils are cultivated. Corn, sorghum, and soybeans are the principal crops. Mid-prairie grasses are dominant in rangeland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nebraska. LRR M, MLRA 102B, 106; The series is of minor extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Saunders County, Nebraska, 1994. The series name is coined.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Ap1, Ap2, E1, E2, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 80 inches.  (A, E, Bt horizons)
albic horizon:  The zone from 7 to 15 inches.  (E horizons)
argillic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 80 inches.  (All Bt horizons)
linear extensibility: exceeds 6.0 between the surface and 100 cm

Remarks: These soils were mapped as Butler or Fillmore, drained on older surveys. These soils possibly formed in enclosed depressions, but road construction and ditches and past drainage activities have provided surface drainage of the area.
