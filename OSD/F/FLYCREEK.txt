FLYCREEK SERIES

The Flycreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from acidic tuffs. Flycreek soils are on shoulders and back slopes of mountains. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over clayey, amorphic over smectitic, frigid Alfic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Flycreek ashy silt loam - woodland, on a 20 percent convex northwest-facing slope at an elevation of 4,430 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Andic soil materials are apparent field textures.)

   Oi--0 to 1 inches; partially decomposed duff, needles and twigs.

   A--1 to 8 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick.)

   Bw--8 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; common fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick.)

   2Btbl--23 to 27 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

   2Btb2--27 to 34 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the 2Btb horizon is 8 to 18 inches.)

   R--34 inches; weathered acidic tuffs.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Geisercreek soils.
Geisercreek soils - greater than 60 inches to bedrock
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flycreek soils are on shoulders and back slopes of mountains or plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The soil is formed in ash over residuum and colluvium derived from acidic tuffs. Elevations are 3,600 to 6,200 feet. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Btree, Syrupcreek, Flyvalley, and Thirstygulch soils. Btree soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact, have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower subsoil and are located on side slopes of mountains. Syrupcreek soils have less than 35 percent clay in the lower subsoil and are located on side slopes of mountains. Flyvalley soils are 10 to 20 inches to hard fractured tuffs, have less than 35 percent clay in the profile and are located on shoulders of mountains. Thirstygulch soils lack andic properties, lack a contrasting particle-size control section, and are located on side slopes of mountains and plateaus.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability in the upper ash layer and slow permeability in the lower subsoil.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, watershed, recreation and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is grand fir, western larch, Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, twinflower, prince's pine, big huckleberry, northwestern sedge, Scoulars willow, birchleaf spiraea, western meadowrue, roundleaf violet, pinegrass, heartleaf arnica, sidebelle pyrola and rattlesnake plantain.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon; MLRA 43c. The soils are of small extent.
