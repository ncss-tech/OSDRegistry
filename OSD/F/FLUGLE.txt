FLUGLE SERIES 

The Flugle series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately to moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium, fan alluvium from shale and sandstone on summits of mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, hills, ridges and fan terraces and fan remnants on valley sides. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Flugle sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds; neutral, clear wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt2--9 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common medium fine and very fine roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds; abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

    BC--17 to 29 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and fine, common very fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 12 inches thick)

    C--29 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Catron County, New Mexico; about 5 miles north of Pietown on the Diamond T Ranch in the SE 1/4, NW 1/4, sec. 25, T. 2 N., R. 13 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture - The soil moisture control section is moist in some part during the 120 days following the winter solstice and is moist in all parts less than 25 percent of the time that the soil temperature at 20 inch depths is above 41 degrees F. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 49 to 56 degrees F.

Depth to the base of the Bt horizon - 15 to 30 inches.

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 0 to 10 percent. In some pedons, secondary carbonates occur below the Bt horizons.

Rock fragments - 0 to 15 percent on a weighted average.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arnor (NM), Arwite (WY), Augustine (NM), Bigbow (KS), Bosonoak (NM), Carri (AZ), Celacy (NM), Celavar (NM), Dalhart (OK), Deekay (WY), Dermala (NM), Elwop (WY), Evpark (NM), Fort Collins (CO), Gateson (WY), Goesling (NM), Iwela (NM), Lykorly (AZ), Navajita (NM), Nyjack (NM), Oldwolf (WY), Olnest (CO), Orlie (NM), Parkelei (NM), Pinitos (NM), Rauzi (WY), Ribera (NM), Rockybutte (WY), Stoneham (CO), Toluca (MT), and Wagonhound (WY) series. Arnor soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Augustine, Parkelei and Pinitos series have more than 35 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Bigbow soils have buried paleosol horizons. Carri, Celavar, Celacy, Evpark, Gateson, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 40 inches. Dermala soils have igneous or metamorphic parent material. Goesling and soils have calcic horizons and will reclassify in the Calcidic subgroup. Iwela soils have a skeletal discontinuity within 40 inches. Lykorly soils have annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F. Bosonoak and Orlie soils have less than 35 percent sand in the control section. Rockybutte soils have fragmental material within 40 inches. The Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils are in LRR-E or LRR-G soils and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flugle soils are on summits of mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, hills, ridges and fan terraces and fan remnants on valley sides with slopes of 0 to 25 percent. Flugle soils formed in eolian material and alluvium from shale and sandstone at elevations of 5,600 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches. The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Catman, Fragua, Jacee, Jacques, Loarc, Viuda  Jacee soils are moderately deep. Jacee, Jacques and Catman soils are fine textured. Fragua soils are moderately coarse textured and on similar landscapes. Loarc soils have mollic epipedons. Viuda soils are shallow and on old basalt lava flows.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing and wood production. Native vegetation is pinyon, oneseed juniper, blue grama, ring muhly, sage wort, and rubber rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West Central and North Central New Mexico. MLRAs 35 & 36, LRR-D. This soil is of moderate extent.
