FIFTEENMILE SERIES

The Fifteenmile series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits with minor amounts of limestone and quartzite.  Fifteenmile soils are on stream terraces, drainageways, and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chuffa, McLoughlin, Ottmar, Schlomer and Tulch series. 

Chuffa soils lack Bqk horizons. McLoughlin soils are moist for 45 consecutive days following summer solstice and are moderately or strongly saline-alkali. Ottmar soils have a paralithic at 100 to 150 cm and Bk horizons at 56 to 90 cm. Schlomer soils have a paralithic contact at moderate depth and Bk horizons at 38 to 66 cm. Tulch soils are noncalcareous in the cambic horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fifteenmile soils are on stream terraces, drainageways and inset fans. These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with minor components of limestone and quartzite. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,600 to 2,000 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mosida, Penoyer, Rebel, and Sevenmile soils. Mosida soils are coarse-loamy and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Penoyer soils are coarse-silty. Rebel and Sevenmile soils are coarse-loamy. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Fifteenmile soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, basin wildrye and rabbitbrush. This soil is correlated to ecological site R028AY031NV, Loamy Fan 8-10 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
