FALLRIVER SERIES

The Fallriver series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in till and colluvium derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Fallriver soils are on moraines and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, isotic Typic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Fallriver gravelly sandy loam, on a north facing, convex, 32 percent slope in forest at an elevation of 9,735 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 29, 1997 the soil was moist from 0 to 63 inches.  The surface is covered by 1 percent stones and 1 percent cobbles

    Oe--0 to 2 inches; moderately decomposed needles, moss and lichens.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

    E--2 to 9 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine to coarse roots; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 13 inches thick)

    Bs1--9 to 21 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few faint patchy clay films on faces of peds and few faint patchy iron stains on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bs2--21 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few faint patchy clay films on faces of peds and common distinct continuous iron stains on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 inches thick)

    BC--35 to 63 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).
