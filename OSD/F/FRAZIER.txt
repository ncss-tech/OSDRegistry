COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brown Bear, Burwill, Caris, Indleton, Itat, Jana, Maki, Parkaloe, Rockyglen, and Skyland soils. Brown Bear soils formed from metavolcanic or sedimentary rock and the mean annual rainfall is 45 inches (114 centimeters). Burwill, Pardaloe, and Skyland soils are deep and have different parent materials. Claris soils formed in altered sedimentary rock and mean annual rainfall is 32 inches (81 centimeters). Indleton, and Rockyglen soils are very deep. Itat soils formed in basalt and mean annual rainfall is 23 inches (58 centimeters). Jana soils are shallow and Maki soils formed in calcareous rock and glacial till.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frazier soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 2,103 to 5,246 feet (641.0 to 1,599 meters). Slope is 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from granite. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches (33 to 43 centimeters). The mean annual temperature is about 57 to 60 degrees F. (13.9 to 15.6 degrees C.); the average January temperature is 42 to 54 degrees F. (5.6 to 12.2 degrees C.); the average July temperature is about 72 to 78 degrees F. (22.2 to 25.6 degrees C.) The frost free season is about 200 to 250 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Geghus soils. Geghus soils have a fine-loamy particle size class and an argillic horizon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff, and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and homesite development. Vegetation is oats, cheatgrass, buckwheat, scruboak, juniper, and yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Transverse Range of Southern California.  The series is not extensive.  MLRA is 15.
