FESTINA SERIES

The Festina series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium over stratified slackwater deposits. These soils are on low stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Winneshiek County, Iowa, 1964

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 51 to 101 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 165 centimeters (Ap, E, BE, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 51 centimeters (Ap, E, and BE horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 51 to 165 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.

A stratified substratum phase is mapped in MLRA 105 in Wisconsin. Additional phases may be required for sandy substratums.
