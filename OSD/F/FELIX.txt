FELIX SERIES

The Felix series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poor and poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Felix soils are in upland basins, playas and depressions.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Felix soils are in upland basins, playas and depressions that are subject to ponding.  They formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 3,600 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bahl, Bidman, Cambria, Deekay, Echeta, Forkwood, Jaywest, Moorhead, Oshoto, Silhouette and Ulm soils.  Bahl, Bidman, Echeta, Jaywest, Mooorhead, Silhouette and Ulm soils are fine.  Cambria, Deekay and Forkwood soils are fine-loamy.  Oshoto soils are fine-silty.  All these soils occur on higher positions on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly and poorly drained; runoff is ponded; very slow permeability; the soil has a wet soil moisture state at a depth of 1 foot above the surface to a depth of 1.5 feet at some time during the period of April through July.  The soil ponds occasionally to frequently for long or very long duration during the months of March to July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are utilized for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly Basin wildrye, green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, and big bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Felix soils occur in northeastern Wyoming.  MLRA 58B.  The series is of small extent.
