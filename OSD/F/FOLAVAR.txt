FOLAVAR SERIES

The Folavar series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on flood plains and stream terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent with mounded micro-relief a common feature.  The mean annual precipitation is about 310 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Ustic Aquicambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Folavar very gravelly sandy loam on a 1 percent slope in native grass hay.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Oi--0 to 5 cm; dense root mass.

     A--5 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine continuous irregular pores; 40 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

     Bw--18 to 36 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; many medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many very fine and few fine continuous irregular pores; 30 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (18 to 38 cm thick)

     2C1--36 to 56 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine and common fine continuous irregular pores; 60 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (20 to 23 cm thick)

     2C2--56 to 156 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine and common fine continuous irregular pores; 70 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Albany County, Wyoming; about 760 meters east, about 15 meters north of the SW corner, Section 27, T14N, R76W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm--less than 8 degrees C
Mean annual summer soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm--greater than 15 degrees C
Mean annual winter and summer soil temperatures differ by more than 5 degrees C
Soil is dry in all parts more than half the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is above 5 degrees C, and never moist in some or all parts for as long as 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is above 8 degrees C.
Organic matter content of the surface 18 cm--1 or 2 percent
Depth to base of cambic horizon--28 to 50 cm
Fluctuating water table--0 to 61 cm and occurs during the growing season due to irrigation

Particle-size control section
Clay content--5 to 12 percent with less than 50 percent very fine sand
Rock fragment content--35 to 70 percent
Reaction--pH 6.6 to 7.8

A horizon
Value--4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma--2 or 3 dry and moist
Rock fragment content--20 to 40 percent pebbles

Bw horizon
Hue--10YR or 7.5YR
Value--4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma--3 or 4 dry and moist
Texture--gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam
Rock fragment content--30 to 45 percent pebbles

2C horizon
Hue--10YR or 7.5YR
Value--4 or 5 dry
Chroma--3 through 5 dry and moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pahlow and Shurley(T) series.  The Pahlow soil has a calcic horizon.  The Shurley soil contains 20 to 50 percent flagstones throughout the major part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--flood plains and terraces
Elevation--1825 to 2375 meters
Slope--0 to 3 percent
Parent material--mixed alluvium
Mean annual precipitation--250 to 360 mm of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June
Mean annual air temperature--4 to 7 degrees C
Frost-free period--85 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, slow runoff; moderately rapidly permeable in A and Bw horizons over rapidly permeable 2C horizons

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated native grass hayland, rangeland, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, basin wildrye, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Folivar soils are of small extent in southeastern Wyoming; MLRA 34A
