FERNLINE SERIES 

The Fernline series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains or terraces in valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Andic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Fernline ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--2 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; volcanic ash component; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick) 

    Bw--3 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 11 inches thick) 

    2E--11 to 16 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (3  to 10 inches thick) 

    2Bt/E--16 to 23 inches; Bt part (60 percent) is pink (7.5YR 7/4) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist, E part (40 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 11 inches thick) 

    2Bt--23 to 36 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) and pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) and pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 24 inches thick) 

    2C--36 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) and pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) silty clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) and pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine distinct mottles; neutral (pH 7.2).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Fernline soils are used mainly for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation is mainly Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, lodgepole pine, grand fir, western white pine, western red cedar, and western hemlock. Understory vegetation is mainly common snowberry, white spirea, oceanspray, twinflower, queencup beadlily, western goldthread, columbia brome, starry false solomonseal, trailplant, and other forbs and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Fernline soils are of limited extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.
