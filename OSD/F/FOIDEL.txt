FOIDEL SERIES 

The Foidel series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, hills, and plateaus.  They formed in loess and alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Slopes range from 3 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Palecryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Foidel loam, on a southeast facing slope of 6 percent in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

     Oi--0 to 1 inch to; slightly decomposed leaves and twigs. 

     A1--1 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick) 

     A2--6 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick) 

     A3--11 to 25 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick) 

     B/E--25 to 39 inches; 60 percent brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist (Bt part), and 40 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3), dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist (E part); weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick) 

     Bt1--39 to 49 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; few uncoated sand grains on faces of peds; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick) 

     Bt2--49 to 61 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ercan, Redspur, Skylick, and Yeljack series.  

Ercan:  Have sandstone bedrock at depths of 47 to 60 inches.
Redspur and Yeljack:  have hues of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon. 
Skylick:  do not have B/E or E/B horizons.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess and alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone and shale
Landform:  mountain slopes, hills, plateaus
Slopes:  3 to 75 percent
Elevation: 7,000 to 9,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  34 to 40 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  18 to 30 inches, more than half of which falls as snow.
Frost-free period:  40 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Routt, Clayburn, and Winevada soils.  
The Clayburn soils have the top of the argillic horizon above 24 inches.
Routt soils have fine textured particle-size control sections. 
Winevada soils lack an argillic horizon and have a lithic contact above 40 inches. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are mainly used for livestock grazing with small areas of nonirrigated small grains.  At the type location, the native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Saskatoon serviceberry, whortleleaf snowberry, mountain brome, Columbia needlegrass, slender wheatgrass, and Letterman needlegrass.  Some areas have aspen or Gambel's oak with an understory of bromes, needlegrasses, and numerous forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Foidel soils occur in northwestern Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent with about 12,000 acres in the Routt County Area and 3,000 acres in the Moffat County Area.
