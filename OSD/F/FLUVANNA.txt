TYPE LOCATION: Greensville County, Virginia; about 0.9 mile north of the junction of highways VA-633 and VA-603 and 0.5 mile west of Highway VA-633, about 3 miles southwest of Brink.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum thickness: 30 to 60 inches 
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 72 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: Greater than 60 inches
Rock Fragment Content: 2 to 15 percent percent, by volume, in the A and E horizons; 0 to 10 percent, by volume, in the Bt horizon; 5 to 40 percent, by volume, in the C horizon
Soil Reaction: Very strongly acid or strongly acid, except where limed

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:
The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6
and chroma of 1 through 6. Value of 3 and chroma of 1 is restricted to the Ap horizon. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. 

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6
and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8. In some pedons, the lower Bt horizon contains high chroma mottles or is multicolored and does not have a dominant matrix color. Texture is clay, clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam with more than 30 percent silt and 35 to 60 percent clay in the particle size control section. 

The BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8 or is mottled in shades of these colors.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or gravelly analogues of these textures. 

The C horizon colors are highly variable and commonly contain shades of red, brown and yellow.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no other series in the same family.  The Badin, Nason, Tatum, and Uwharrie series in closely related families. The Badin soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches.  The Tatum and Uwharrie soils have hue of 2.5YR or redder.  In addition, Tatum soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches.  Nason soils have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Piedmont
Landform: Uplands
Geomorphic Component: Interfluves
Parent Material: Mixed basic and acidic crystalline rock 
Slope: 0 to 25 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
In addition to the closely associated Badin, Nason, Tatum, and Uwharrie soils, these are the Cullen soils.  Cullen soils have hue of 2.5YR or redder.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage Class (Agricultural):  Well drained
Permeability: Moderately slow
Shrink-Swell Potential: Moderate

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most of these soils are wooded. Vegetation consists mostly of second growth oaks, poplar, shortleaf and Virginia pines, dogwood, red cedar, hickory, and sweetgum. Some of these soils are cultivated or in pasture. Crops grown are corn, small grain, and mixed hay

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Virginia and possibly North Carolina.
Extent: This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fluvanna County, VA, 1949.

REMARKS: This series type location was originally in Louisa County, Virginia which is now a mesic temperature regime area. It was reclassified to mesic family 2001.  The distribution of the series has more acreage in the thermic temperature regime, therefore it is now thermic (2007).  The soils in the thermic area are also very deep to soft bedrock.  

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:

Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 1 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 5 to 55 inches (Bt horizons)
