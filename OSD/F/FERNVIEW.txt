REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon

06/2016--Assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence.

In some areas, the soils may have dense till at a depth of 100 to 150 cm.
