FOXCREEK SERIES

The Foxcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed, stratified alluvium. These soils form on flood plains, drainageways that cross fan remnants, terraces, or valley floors on slopes 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mooseflat and Walden soils. Mooseflat soils are very poorly drained and do not have a calcic horizon or carbonates. Walden soils always have a calcic horizon with more than 15 percent calcium carbonate. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Alluvial plains, outwash plains, and plateaus 
Landform: Flood plains of rivers and streams on the valley floor and floodplains of drainageways on plateaus; drainageways that cross fan remnants, valley floors, or terraces

Slope: 0 to 8 percent, dominantly less than 1 percent
Parent material: Mixed stratified alluvium 
Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 457 mm including 1.8 to 2.1 meters of snow. 
Precipitation is quite evenly distributed, but May and June have slightly more than the remaining months.
Mean annual air temperature: 3.3 to 6.7 degrees C
Frost free period: 20 to 50 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Zufelt, Furniss, Boquet, Zohner, Zundell, Driggs, Feltonia, Badgerton, Felt and Wiggleton soils on similar landforms. Zufelt soils have a calcic horizon within or immediately below the mollic epipedon. Furniss soils are very poorly drained and lack the contrasting particle-size class family. Boquet soils are located in nearby swales and slight depressions on valley floors and have a histic epipedon. Zohner and Zundell soils are on adjacent micro-highs and have carbonatic mineralogy. Driggs, Feltonia, Badgerton, Felt, and Wiggleton soils are on outwash and alluvial fans and have xeric soil moisture regimes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class: Poorly drained
Runoff: Low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: Moderately high over very high. 
Flooding frequency and duration: Occasional to frequent flooding for long periods in May to July 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: Pasture and hay
Range/ecological site: R013XY038ID
Dominant native vegetation: Sedges, baltic rush, wiregrass, white dutch clover, red top, timothy and willows 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Eastern Idaho, MLRA 13
Extent: The series is not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Teton County, Idaho, 1966; Teton Area, Idaho-Wyoming Soil Survey 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 5 to 38 cm
Calcic horizon: 66 to 107 cm
Redoximorphic features (iron concentrations/depletions): Beginning at a depth of 5 cm
Particle size control section: from a depth of 25 to 100 cm the upper part from 25 to 66 cm averages about 22 percent clay and 16 percent rock fragments (fine-loamy). The lower part averages about 5 percent clay and 45 percent rock fragments (sandy-skeletal).
Soil temperature regime: Cryic (depending on management; O horizons maybe absent, drained and undrained areas may occur and all areas are considered cryic).
Soil moisture regime: Aquic 

ADDITIONAL DATA: 
Lab data from NSSL, Lincoln, NE:
This pedon was not sampled. 
Additional reference samples are PEDON ID S05ID-081-003-002. 
The soil has a calcic horizon but is not a Calcic Cryaquoll as the calcic horizon is not within or directly below the mollic epipedon.
