MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 1936

REMARKS: NJ0203 (Fallsington Variant) was used in Middlesex County, NJ. This soil will be a new series when the survey is updated.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 14 to 29 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 10 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
