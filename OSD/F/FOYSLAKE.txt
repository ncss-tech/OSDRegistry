FOYSLAKE SERIES

The Foyslake series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous till. These soils are on moraines in glaciated valleys and on mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Grizzly, Pactola, and Rockoa series. These soils do not have calcic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Foyslake soils are on moraines in glaciated valleys and on mountain slopes. Elevations are 2,900 to 5,200 feet. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Aspects are northerly, where shade minimizes evapotranspiration. These soils formed in calcareous till. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 30 inches, much of which falls as snow or as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kingspoint, McMannamy, and Jimlake series. Kingspoint soils are on convex positions on south facing slopes. They are ustic, shallow to carbonates, and lack an argillic horizon. McMannamy soils are on concave and linear positions on southerly aspects, and convex positions on more shaded aspects. They are ustic and shallow to carbonates, but have a thin argillic horizon. Jimlake soils occur on concave, north sloping aspects above 4300 feet elevation. They generally have a thick ash mantle, cryic soil temperature regime, and are deep or very deep to carbonates.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Foyslake soils are used for timber production and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is western larch, Douglas-fir, and scattered Engelmann spruce with an understory of twinflower, pinegrass, snowberry, dwarf huckleberry, and Rocky mountain maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Foyslake soils are of small extent in northwestern Montana. MLRA 43A and 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Flathead County, Montana 2005. The name is from the Foys Lake area southwest of Kalispell in the Upper Flathead Valley of Northwest Montana.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 12 inches (Oi and E horizon); 
Argillic horizon - from 12 to 28 inches, (lower half of Bt/E and all of Bt horizon); 
Calcic horizon - at 28 inches (Bk horizon);
Particle-size control section - from 12 to 28 inches. 

Foyslake soils have a frigid temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.
