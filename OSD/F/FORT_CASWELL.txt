GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Bohicket, Carteret, Fort Fisher, Kureb, Molasses Creek, Newhan, Prices Creek, Showboat, Sunny Point, and Wando soils.
Bohicket soils--are on broad level tidal marsh flats bordering the Atlantic Ocean and formed in silty and clayey marine sediments.
Carteret soils--are on back-barrier island tidal marshes of the Atlantic Coast and formed in sandy marine deposits.
Fort Fisher soils--are in barrier coves and submerged wave-cut platforms fluctuating from low to high energy formed from sandy over loamy intermixed estuarine deposits and have lithologic discontinuities within 100 centimeters of the soil surface.
Kureb soils--are on gently sloping to moderately steep soils on Coastal Plain uplands and side slopes along streams and bays and formed in marine, eolian, or fluvial sands with spodic horizon characteristics.
Molasses Creek soils--are in estuarine tidal streams and barrier coves formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits.
Newhan soils--are on gently undulating dunes commonly near beaches and waterways, do not have water at or near the soil surface, and formed in sand and shelly eolian deposits along the Atlantic Coast.
Prices Creek soils--are in estuarine tidal streams and formed in fine-loamy estuarine deposits.
Showboat soils--are in mainland coves and estuarine tidal streams and formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and contain 40 centimeters of buried organic soil material within 200 centimeters of the soil surface. 
Sunny Point soils--are on lower energy shoals and mainland coves and formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and contain at least 15 centimeters of sulfidic materials within the top 50 centimeters of the soil.
Wando soils--are on terraces of the Coastal Plain and formed in sandy fluviomarine deposits.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brunswick County, North Carolina, 2024

REMARKS: 
Fort Caswell is derived from Fort Caswell that is on the easternmost point of Oak Island at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. It was built in 1837 to guard the entrance of Southpoint harbor from potential threats from the Atlantic Ocean. The fort served as one of two primary training centers for soldiers before their departure for Europe in World War I. The fort was decommissioned in 1945. 

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022)--

Reduced Matrix--0 to 195 centimeters (0 to 77 inches); soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but undergoes a change in color within 30 minutes after the soil material has been exposed to air
Endosaturation--0 to 195 centimeters (0 to 77 inches)
Fluventic subgroup--An organic carbon content of 0.2 percent or more at 125 centimeters or an irregular decrease in organic carbon at a depth of 25 to 125 centimeters. 
Peraquic feature--Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface.
