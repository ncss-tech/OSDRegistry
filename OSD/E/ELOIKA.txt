ELOIKA SERIES

The Eloika series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash or ablation till of mixed mineralogy with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on terraces, terrace breaks, and till plains and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aits, Bonner, Clayton, Laketon, Merkel, Nevine, and Waits soils. Aits and Waits soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 18 to 36 cm thick. Clayton soils have an influence of volcanic ash 18 cm thick with 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass. Laketon soils have a fine-silty control section. Merkel and Nevine soils have a loamy-skeletal control section. Bonner soils are on similar outwash terraces and are ashy over loamy-skeletal in the particle size control and have sandy or sandy skeletal layers within 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for timber production, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Some areas are cultivated for production of small grains, alfalfa, hay, and grasses; or are used for grazing. Overstory vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, western larch and grand fir. Understory vegetation is mallow, ninebark, Oregon-grape, snowbrush ceanothus, snowberry, and wild rose. Ground vegetation is kinnikinnick, myrtle pachystima, strawberry, pinegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. MLRA 44A. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington, l961.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 cm (Oe, E, horizons)
Andic feature - the zone from 3 to 38 cm (E, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 64 cm (Bw1, Bw2, 2BC horizons)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 3 to 103 cm (E, Bw1, Bw2, 2BC, part of the 2C1 horizons).

Note: The E horizon is assumed to be younger volcanic ash (Mt. St. Helens T or W) and not related to any spodic horizon. It is less than 1 cm thick.

The 10/01 description reflected a change in classification from Ashy over loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Vitrixerands to Ashy over loamy, glassy over isotic, frigid Typic Vitrixerands.
