ELKROCK SERIES 

The Elkrock series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium with a high component of volcanic ash in the upper horizons.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Elkrock cobbly ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A--2 to 4 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) cobbly ashy silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and common coarse roots; 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bw--4 to 15 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly ashy silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and common coarse roots; 15 percent cobbles and 35 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 40 inches thick) 

    2C--15 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely cobbly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 40 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Elkrock soils are used for timber production, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir with an understory of rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Saskatoon serviceberry, white spirea and antelope bitterbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Elkrock soils are of small extent in western Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1292.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ash influenced layer from 2 to 15 inches (A, Bw horizons); an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 15 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches below the mineral soil surface (Bw, 2C horizon).  Elkrock soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
