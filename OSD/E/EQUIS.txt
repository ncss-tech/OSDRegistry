EQUIS SERIES

The Equis series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments and alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Equis soils are on alluvial flats, floodplains and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, carbonatic, mesic Typic Halaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Equis silty clay--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist at or near the surface.  Saturated at a depth of 13 to 50 cm in most years. Depth to the water table ranges from about 30 cm in the spring to 150 cm in late summer.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C.
Reaction - Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.
Sodicity (SAR): 20 to 70 percent in the upper 50 cm, decreasing to less than 5 percent below 50 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Equis soils are on alluvial flats, floodplains and lake plains. These soils formed in limy lacustrine sediments, in some places recently mantled with alluvium. Elevations are 1,560 to 1,920 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boofus and Duffer soils.  Boofus soils have a clayey over loamy particle-size control section.  Duffer soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; slow to ponded runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Drained phases and rarely flooded phases are recognized adjacent to springs, seeps and ponds.  Frequently flooded phases are recognized adjacent to stream channels.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly black greasewood, rubber rabbitbrush, inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, iodinebush and scattered sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28B.
