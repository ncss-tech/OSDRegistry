EDIEBENCH SERIES

The Ediebench series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium with loess influence over colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks and limestone.  Ediebench soils are on mountains, fan remnants, and hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.8 degrees C.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Calcic Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ediebench loam on a southeast facing, 8 percent slope at an elevation of 2,219 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

   Bt1--15 to 30 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on all faces of peds and on surfaces along pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

   Bt2--30 to 53 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on all faces of peds and on surfaces along pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.(combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 20 to 51 cm)

   Bk1--53 to 66 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate in the matrix; violently effervescent (24 percent calcium carbonate); 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 20 cm thick)

   Bk2--66 to 84 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate in the matrix; violently effervescent (32 percent calcium carbonate); 50 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 20 cm thick)

   Bk3--84 to 155 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate in the matrix; violently effervescent (41 percent calcium carbonate); 50 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: mountains
Landform: mountains, fan remnants and hillslopes
Elevation: 2,073 to 2,393 meters
Slope: 1 to 30 percent
Parent material: slope alluvium with loess influence over colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks and limestone 
Mean annual air temperature: 2.2 to 3.9 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: 406 to 559 mm
Frost free period: 30 to 45 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Latigo, Tineman, Windicreek and Zeebar series.  Latigo soils are loamy-skeletal and are on nearly level to steep mountains, hillslopes and dissected fan remnants derived from weathered rhyolite.  Tineman soils are loamy-skeletal and are on shoulder slopes of dissected fan remnants derived from quartzite, rhyolite and sandstone.  Windicreek soils are loamy-skeletal and are on nearly level to very steep dissected fan remnants derived dominantly from calcareous sandstone conglomerate.  Zeebar soils are loamy-skeletal and are formed in colluvium from quartzite, basalt and tuff and are on mountains, hillslopes, ridges and fan remnants.
