ELIZARIO SERIES

The Elizario series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in eolian sands over alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on slightly depressed alluvial flats of basin floors. Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.
