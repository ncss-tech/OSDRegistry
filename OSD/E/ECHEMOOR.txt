ECHEMOOR SERIES

The Echemoor series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to bedrock. They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from sedimentary rock. Echemoor soils are on mountainslopes and hillslopes contiguous to mountain fronts. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Echemoor loam-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 5 percent sandstone channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

    AB--10 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent sandstone channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--16 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 10 percent sandstone channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--22 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to strong subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining few pores; 10 percent sandstone channers, neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (The Bt horizons are 13 to 30 inches thick.)

    Cr--36 to 60 inches; noncalcareous, weakly consolidated shale interbedded with lenses of sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Carbon County, Wyoming. The SE1/4 of SW1/4 of sec. 16, T. 17 N., R. 88 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the bedrock and paralithic contact is typically about 28 to 35 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 32 inches thick and typically includes the upper part of the Bt horizon. These soils are noncalcareous throughout. The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent small channers throughout.

The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.

The Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 but more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bavdark, Bachus, Benteen, Cambern, Clayburn, Crystalbutt, Davtone, Decross, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Gordo, Hagenbarth, Harmehl, Millerlake, Pontuge, Senchert, Southmount, Poodle, Stubbs, Thulepah, Vadnais,Winn, and Winu series. The Bachus, Benteen, Cambern, Harmehl, Senchert, Vadnais, Winn, and Winu soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. The Bavdark, Crystalbutt, Davtone, Clayburn, Decross, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Dranyon, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Pontuge, Southmount, and Thulepah soils are more than 40 inches deep. Gordo soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the Bt horizon. Stubbs soils contain free carbonates in the lower strata. Poodle soils are 45 to 70 percent sand in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Echemoor soils are on mountain footslopes and lower hillslopes contiguous to mountain fronts. They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from noncalcareous sedimentary rock. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 7,000 to 9,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and ranges from 15 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. and ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bynum and Owen Creek soils. Both soils have mollic epipedons less than 15 inches thick. Also, Owen Creek soils have over 35 percent clay in the Bt horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff depending upon slope; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland, wildlife, and limited native pasture. Native vegetation is Idaho fescue, Columbia needlegrass, and some big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountains of north central and south central Wyoming. The soil is of limited extent.
