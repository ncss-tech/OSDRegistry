ENENTAH SERIES

The Enentah series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Enentah soils are on glaciated mountain slopes and moraines.  Slopes range from 10 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Enentah very stony loam , on a southwest facing, convex, 32 percent slope in a spruce-fir forest at an elevation of 10,288 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 15, 1997 the soil was moist from 6 to 72 inches.  The surface is covered by 2 percent boulders, 2 percent stones and 25 percent cobbles

(4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bs1--6 to 20 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly  plastic; common fine and medium roots; 20 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.

    BC--56 to 72 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 35 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).
