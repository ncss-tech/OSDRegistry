EUELL SERIES

The Euell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolite, rhyodacite, or rhyolitic tuff.  These soils are on mountain slopes, hills, benches and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-Skeletal, glassy Vitrandic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Euell gravelly ashy loam, in rangeland on a 28 percent slope at 1,890 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt--25 to 79 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly ashy sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint discontinuous clay films on ped faces and along pore linings; 55 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 70 cm thick)

    BC--79 to 109 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) very gravelly ashy sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    R--109 cm; indurated tuffaceous rhyolite.

Elevation - 1,555 to 2,275 meters
Slope - 4 to 60 percent 
Parent material - colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolite, rhyodacite, or rhyolitic tuff

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Associated soils which occur on similar landforms are the Nissler, Hungryhill and Eastridge soil series.  Nissler soils are very deep.  Hungryhill soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Eastridge soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Euell soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is chiefly mixed grasses, such as bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue and Idaho fescue with some areas of widely scattered Douglas fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Euell soils are of small extent in southwestern and central Montana. MLRA - 43B.
