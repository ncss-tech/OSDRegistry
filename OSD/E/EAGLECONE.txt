EAGLECONE SERIES

The Eaglecone series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and eolian sand over basalt.  Eaglecone soils are on smooth and convex positions on lava flows on lava fields.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is about 355 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calcixerolls
