ELBBOC SERIES

The Elbboc series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. Elbboc soils are on alluvial fans and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Calcidic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Elbboc very gravelly sandy loam - rangeland (Colors are for air-dry soils unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 45 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; few very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 30 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 cm)

    2C1--18 to 53 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; 50 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; very slightly effervescent; 2 percent thin (< 1mm) patchy calcium carbonate  concretions on bottom of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear way boundary. (35 to 63 cm thick)

    2C2--53 to 115 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 40 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; very slightly effervescent; 3 percent thin (< 1mm) patchy calcium carbonate  concretions on bottom of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (63 to 88 cm thick)

    2C3--115 to 150 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 40 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; very slightly effervescent; 3 percent thin (< 1mm) patchy calcium carbonate  concretions on bottom of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). 

TYPE LOCATION: Sevier County, Utah, southeast of Monroe; 2,290 feet west and 4,80 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 22, T. 25 S., R. 3 W.; Monroe Peak USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 36 minutes 18 seconds N and longitude 112 degrees 6 minutes 50 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 9.0 to 12.0 degrees C.
Depth to lithologic discontinuity (2C horizons): 18 to 25 cm.
Depth to identifiable secondary carbonates: 18 to 75 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Average 0 to 5 percent.
Rock fragments: 45 to 80 percent; lithologies of the fragments are mainly volcanic rocks such as breccia, ash-flow tuff, volcanic sandstone and conglomerate, quartz latite; includes some intrusive rocks such as monzonite or diorite. 

A horizon
Hue: 7.5 YR or 10YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent.
Organic matter: 1 to 2 percent.

2C horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Sand, coarse sand, or loamy sand.
Rock fragments: 45 to 85 percent
  Gravel: 25 to 50 percent.
  Cobbles: 20 to 40 percent.
  Stones: 0 to 5 percent.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 2 to 10 percent.
Identifiable secondary carbonates: Less than 5 percent, commonly as thin (< 1 mm) coatings on the bottom of rock fragments.
Organic matter: 0 to 0.5 percent.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elbboc soils formed in alluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks. Elbboc soils are on alluvial fans and alluvial flats. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,625 to 1,735 meters. The mean annual temperature is 8.0 to 10.5 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Annabella and Monroe series. The Annabella soils are loamy-skeletal and lack a mollic epipedon. The Monroe soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic epipedon thicker than 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, very slow to medium runoff, moderate over rapid to very rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally for livestock grazing and some irrigated cropland. Potential vegetation consists of shadscale, Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail. These soils are correlated to semidesert ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South and east of Monroe, Utah; MLRA 28A; these soils are of small extent.
