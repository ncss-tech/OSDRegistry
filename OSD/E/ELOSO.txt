ELOSO SERIES

The Eloso series consists of moderately deep to siltstone, well drained, soils that formed in clayey alluvial sediments over the Catahoula siltstone.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in)and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Karnes County, Texas 1989.  The name is from a small community in southwest Karnes County.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Monteola and Coy series. The series was updated during the correlation of the initial soil survey of McMullen County. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in).  (Organic carbon is rounded from laboratory data from 0.55 to 0.6 to include the Bk horizon).

Vertic feature - the soil cracks when dry and has PLE of more than 7 cm (2.5 in) and few to common wedge-shaped aggregates.

Paralithic contact at 94 cm (37 in to the top of the 2Cr).
