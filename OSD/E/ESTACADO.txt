ESTACADO SERIES

The Estacado series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and playa slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustolls

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Acuff series. Similar soils also include the Bovina (T-TX), Mansker, Pep, Portales, and Tulia series.

Mansker and Tulia soils: have carbonatic mineralogy; in addition, Tulia soils do not have a mollic epipedon. 
Pep and Portales soils: have a calcic horizon at a depth less than 61 cm (24 in) and do not have an argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Acuff, Bovina, Mansker, Pep, and Portales soils and the Amarillo, Olton, Pantex, Pep, Posey, and Pullman soils. 
Acuff, Bovina, Mansker, Pep, and Tulia soils: are on similar landscape positions. 
Amarillo, Olton, Pantex, and Pullman soils: are on similar landscape positions and are noncalcareous in the surface and upper argillic horizons Portales soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon. 
Posey soils: are on similar landscape positions, have a calcic horizon within 24 in of the soil surface, and do not have a mollic epipedon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately slow permeable. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for crop production. Principal crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax vegetation in rangeland is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairieclover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the Deep Hardland (R077CY022TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77C in 
LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hale County, Texas; 1969. 

REMARKS: These soils were previously included with the Portales and Mansker series. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19 in). (Ap, Bt1 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 15 to 203 cm (6 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, Btk2 horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 97 to 203 cm (38 to 80 in). (Btk1, Btk2 horizons) 
Plugged (kk) horizon: 127 to 203 cm (50 to 80 in) (Btkk1, Btkk2) 
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.
