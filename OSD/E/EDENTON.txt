EDENTON SERIES

The Edenton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in till and the underlying residuum from clayey shale with thin strata of limestone, and in places a mantle of loess as much as 25 cm (10 inches) thick. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees) F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Edenton silt loam, on a northeast-facing, eroded, 14 percent slope in a pasture. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[0 to 38 cm (15 inches) thick]

 2Cr--96 cm (38 inches); interbedded calcareous shale and limestone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Briggsville, Chrome, Eldean, Lamoille, Newnata, Paintcreek, Redbrush, Upshur, Woodsfield, and Wynn series. Briggsville, Eldean, Lamoille, Newnata, Paintcreek, Upshur, and Woodsfield soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Chrome and Redbrush (T) soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Wynn soils have a loess mantle of more than 25 cm (10 inches) in thickness.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edenton soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. The soils formed in highly weathered Illinoian till and in the underlying olive-colored residuum from calcareous interbedded shale and limestone with a mantle of loess up to 25 cm (10 inches) thick in places. Some pedons are underlain by bedrock that is more than half limestone, and in these the contact approaches lithic. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1067 mm (37 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cincinnati, Eden, Fairmount, Grayford, Jessup, Lawshe, Loudon, Opequon, and Rossmoyne series. Cincinnati and Rossmoyne soils have fragipan horizons and commonly are on lesser slopes above Edenton soils. Eden soils lack glacial erratics and are on steeper slopes below Edenton soils. Fairmount and Opequon soils are shallow to bedrock dominated by limestone and are on steeper areas below Edenton soils. Grayford, Jessup, and Loudon soils have a thicker silty mantle and have bedrock at a depth of more than 102 cm (40 inches). Lawshe soils have a mollic epipedon and do not have glacial erratics in the solum. They are on colluvial foot slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low. Permeability is moderately slow or slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Edenton soils are used for permanent pasture or woodland. Some Edenton soils are farmed where they are included in fields with other soils on lesser slopes. Native vegetation is hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Ohio and southern Indiana, and possibly in northern Kentucky; MLRA 114A. The series is of moderate extent, approximately 36,000 acres.
