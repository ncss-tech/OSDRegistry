ELVICK SERIES 

The Elvick series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from hard coarse and fine grained igneous rock. These soils are on alluvial fans and drainageways in mountains.  Slopes are 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryepts

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL sample number S93MT-043-011; Soil interpretation records  MT3023 and MT3024.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
