ESSAL SERIES

The Essal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in unconsolidated lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks.  The Essal soils are on lakeplains and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Essal soils are on lake plains and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in unconsolidated lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,405 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cresal, Hawsley and Isolde series.  All soils lack a contrasting particle-size control section.  Cresal soils also have durinodes and silica cemented lenses.  Hawsley and Isolde soils are also sandy throughout the profile.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very slow or slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, black greasewood, Indian ricegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 27.
