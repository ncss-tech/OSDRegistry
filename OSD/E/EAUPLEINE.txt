EAUPLEINE SERIES

The Eaupleine series consists of deep, moderately well to well drained, gently sloping and sloping, silty soils that formed in loess and underlying loamy glacial till or loamy residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock. These upland soils have moderate permeability. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Eaupleine silt loam 2 to 6 percent slopes, in an alfalfa-timothy meadow (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 15 centimeters; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate, medium, granular structure; friable; many roots; neutral; abrupt, smooth boundary.

 E--15 to 28 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; moderate, thin, platy structure; friable; many roots; slightly acid; clear, wavy boundary.

 E/B--28 to 36 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam (E); moderate, thin, platy structure; friable; isolated remnants of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam (Bt) make up about 40 percent, by volume; many roots; grayish sand grains on ped faces; slightly acid; clear, wavy boundary.

 B/E--36 to 61 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam (Bt); moderate, medium, subangular blocky structure; friable; few tongues of brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam (E) penetrate this horizon from above and make up about 20 percent, by volume thin patchy clay films on faces of peds of Bt part; few roots; slightly acid; clear, wavy boundary.

 2Bt1--61 to 79 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) micaceous loam; moderate, medium, subangular blocky structure; friable to firm; common clay films on faces of peds and in pores; moderately acid; clear, wavy boundary.

 2Bt2--79 to 97 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) micaceous loam; moderate, medium and coarse, subangular blocky structure; friable to firm; few clay films on faces of peds, many small (less than 10 millimeters in diameter) particles of greenish gneiss; strongly acid; clear, wavy boundary.

 2C1--97 to 127 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) and dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) loam; massive; firm; common mica fragments; strongly acid; clear, wavy boundary.

 2C2--127 to 160 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) loam; common mica fragments; massive; firm; many fragments of soft greenish gneiss; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Wood County, Wisconsin; 2,800 feet west and 100 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 2, T. 25 N., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges from 84 to 167 centimeters in thickness but typically is 100 to 150 centimeters thick. In undisturbed areas, an A horizon 8 to 13 centimeters thick is present instead of an Ap horizon. The depth to bedrock is typically below 160 cm but can be observed as shallow as 4 feet (120cm).

The Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. 

The E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. 

The E/B or B/E horizons have tongues of E material surrounding thin, column-like upward extensions of the Bt horizon or wholly surrounding small, isolated remnants of the Bt horizon. The E part has lOYR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam. The Bt part has lOYR or 7.5YR hue, value and chroma of 4 or 5. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. 

The 2Bt horizons have 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value is 4 or 5; and chroma is 3 through 6. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues. The particle-size control section averages between 10 to 18 percent clay and between 25 and 50 percent fine sand or coarser. 

The 2C horizon has 5Y, 2.5Y, lOYR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value is 4 or 5; and chroma is 4 through 8. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or cobbly analogues. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alban, Amery, Freeon, Kennan, Langlade, Marathon, Rosholt, and Scott Lake series in the same family and the Fenwood and Rozellville series. Alban soils do not contain coarse fragments. Amery soils typically have more sand and less silt in the upper part of the solum. Freeon soils have mottles in the argillic horizon. Kennan soils have fewer pebbles in the part of the argillic horizon above a depth of 100 centimeters. Langlade soils have more silt and less sand in the lower part of the argillic horizon above a depth of 100 centimeters. Marathon soils contain more coarse fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon above a depth of 100 centimeters. Rosholt soils have sand and gravel within a depth of 100 centimeters. Scott Lake soils have mottles in the argillic horizon and coarser textures within a depth of 100 centimeters.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on bedrock controlled uplands. Slopes are simple or complex and gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. EauPleine soils formed in 36 to 72 centimeters of loess and in the underlying loamy glacial till 
and loamy residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock. The till is derived mainly from the local residuum. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 71 to 84 centimeters. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altdorf, Dolph, Fenwood, Milladore, Rozellville, and Sherry soils. Altdorf and Dolph soils are nearby, but have the lower part of the sola formed in residuum weathered from micaceous schists. The somewhat poorly drained Milladore and poorly drained and very poorly drained Sherry soils are on very gently sloping and flat or concave positions, in areas marginal to the higher-lying, low ridge sites of EauPleine soils. The Fenwood and Rozellville soils are associates in some landscapes, but they cannot always be separated from EauPleine soils by specific relief. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well and well drained. A seasonal high water table is generally at a depth of more than 150 cm but can be within 100 centimeters of the surface. Available water capacity is high, and permeably is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is cropped to silage corn, small grain, or hay. Some is in pasture. A few areas remain in woodland. Native vegetation was coniferous and deciduous forests with sugar maple, American basswood, paper birch, eastern hemlock, white ash, northern red oak, and red pine predominant. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 90B, in central Wisconsin. This series is of limited extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wood County, Wisconsin, 1971.

REMARKS: This typical pedon was taken from the Wood County, Wi published soil survey manuscript, 1977 where the series was established.  The range in characteristics were taken from the Wood County manuscript and a 1984 OSD revision for Marathon County, WI.  The series was inactive for a while but was reactivated because the series is still correlated in Wood County Wisconsin.  Original classification - COARSE-LOAMY, MIXED TYPIC GLOSSOBORALFS
