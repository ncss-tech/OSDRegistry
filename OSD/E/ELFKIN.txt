ELFKIN SERIES

The Elfkin series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium from loess and volcanic ash over basalt bedrock.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent on lava plains and valleys.  The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm inches and the average annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Elfkin silt loam - on a 3 percent slightly convex southwest-facing slope at 1,100 meters elevation in cropland.  When described on September 1, 1988, the soil was dry to 13 cm and slightly moist below.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Elijah, McPan and Virtue series.  Elijah and Virtue soils are greater than 150 cm to bedrock.  McPan soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elfkin soils are on lava flows on lava plains and in valleys at elevations of 700 to 1,400 meters.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and volcanic ash over basalt.  Average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm.  Average annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 100 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bruncan, Gooding, Purdam and the competing McPan soils.  Bruncan soils have bedrock above 100 cm.  Gooding soils average more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Purdam soils do not have an indurated duripan.  These soils are on similar geomorphic positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high Ksat.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Elfkin soils are used mainly for irrigated cropland, irrigated hayland/pasture and rangeland.  Crops grown include corn, small grains, potatoes and sugar beets.  Native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass and Thurber needlegrass. Some areas have been urbanized.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  MLRA 11.  Elfkin soils are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Ada County, Idaho, 2012.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon - zone from 0 to 13 cm (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - zone from 13 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Indurated duripan - zone from 91 to 114 cm (Bkqm1 and 2Bkqm2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - zone from 13 to 38 cm
Soil moisture regime - aridic bordering on xeric

This soil was originally correlated as Elijah, bedrock substratum phase.  As revised in 2010, Elijah soils must be greater than 150 cm to bedrock.  Bedrock substratum phases of Elijah in Ada County Area, Canyon County Area, and Wood River Area soil surveys (Idaho) will be correlated to the Elfkin Series during MLRA updates.
