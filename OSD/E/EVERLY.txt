EVERLY SERIES

The Everly series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 25 to 90 centimeters of loamy surficial sediments and the underlying till.  These soils are on convex slopes on ground moraines and till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to l8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 690 millimeters.

Wilmonton--are on slightly lower landscape positions on slightly concave to slightly convex slopes and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 0.5 and 1 meter during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 1.0 and 1.8 meters during the wettest period of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered both perched and apparent based on the season and intensity of rainfall during a given period of time
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10.0 micrometers per second

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Clay County, Iowa, l970.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 200 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (Ap, A and BA horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from 41 to 200 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, 2Bk1, 2Bk2, 2BC1 and 2BC2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The structure in the 2BC was documented as typical in MLRA-107 on field reviews in Minnesota and Iowa.  It is the nature of this till to have fracture/structural planes in the lower horizons previously considered an unaltered C horizon.  Carbonate coats, iron coats, and redoximorphic features are common on faces of fractures and structural planes.  Past descriptions have referred to vertical cleavage planes in the C horizon.

Differentia between Everly series and Ocheyedan series needs further study.

These soils are borderline to Oxyaquic subgroup. To resolve this issue, further study may be needed.

Drainage class is a state interpretation.  In some states, the drainage class is called well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual.  

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
