ELEROY SERIES

The Eleroy series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on structural benches and rounded ridgetops. These soils formed loess and residuum from calcareous clayey shale.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Eleroy silt loam on a south-facing, linear convex, 15 percent slope, moderately eroded, forested at an elevation of 228 meters (749 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[10 to 31 cm (4 to 12 inches) thick]

	2Cr--104 to 127 cm (41 to 50 inches); gray (5Y 6/1) clay shale; common coarse prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) stains of oxidized iron and manganese on fragment surfaces; massive; very firm; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baraboo, Birkbeck, Cadiz, Campton, Elco, Inton, Iona, Libre, Mayville, Minnith, Morningsun, Redbud, Rocheport, Rockfield, Somonauk, Uniontown, Winfield, and Zurich series. The, Birkbeck, Cadiz, Campton, Elco, Inton, Iona, Libre, Mayville, Minnith, Morningsun, Redbud, Rockfield, Somonauk, Uniontown, Winfield, and Zurich series do not have bedrock within 152 cm (60 inches). Baraboo soils have a quartzite lithic contact within a depth 102 cm (40 inches).  Rocheport soils have a dolomite lithic contact within a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eleroy soils are on structural benches and rounded ridgetops. They formed in 76 to 140 cm (30 to 55 inches) of loess and in residuum from calcareous clayey shale. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7.2  to 13.9 degrees C (45 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches).  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Derinda, Fayette, Keltner, Massbach and Rozetta soils. Derinda soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Eleroy soils and have bedrock within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Fayette and Rozetta soils are on ridges or sides slopes at higher elevations and do not have bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Keltner and Massbach soils are on landscape positions similar to those of the Eleroy soils and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained--a saturated zone occurs within depths of 2 to 3.5 feet during March to June in most years and is considered perched. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and low to moderately low (0.01 to 0.42 micrometers per second) in the residuum. Permeability is moderate in the loess and very slow in the residuum.  The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow. The native vegetation is hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: northwestern Illinois, northeastern Iowa, and southwestern Wisconsin; LRRs K and M, MLRAs 95B, 105, and 108B. The series is of moderate extent.
