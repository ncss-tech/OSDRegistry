EAGLEWING SERIES 

The Eaglewing series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy calcareous till or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, moraines and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eaglewing gravelly silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed needles and twigs. 

    E--1 to 12 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots and common medium roots; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 18 inches thick) 

    Bw--12 to 21 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots and common medium roots; common fine pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 24 inches thick) 

    Bk1--21 to 28 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; common fine pores and few medium pores; 25 percent gravel; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk2--28 to 37 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; few fine and medium pores; 20 percent hard gravel and 10 percent paragravel; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bk3--37 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) paragravelly silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots and few fine roots; 10 percent gravel and 15 percent paragravel; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
