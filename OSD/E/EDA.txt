EDA SERIES

The Eda series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian deposits on dunes and side slopes in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Lamellic Ustipsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Eda loamy fine sand-in rangeland, at an elevation of 495 m (1625 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) crushed loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) crushed moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to structureless, single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots throughout; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 51 cm [7 to 20 in]) 

   E and Bt1--41 to 74 cm (16 to 29 in); reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) crushed sand, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) crushed moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots and few medium roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; (Bt part) lamellae 2 to 10 mm thick, 2 to 12 cm apart; color of lamellae is red (2.5YR 4/6); lamellae texture is loamy fine sand with 2 to 3 percent more clay than the matrix; few distinct clay films bridging between sand grains; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (Thickness of the E and Bt1 horizon is 38 to 76 cm [15 to 30 in]) 

   E and Bt2--74 to 109 cm (29 to 43 in); reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) crushed sand, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) crushed moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine, few medium and few coarse roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; (Bt part) lamellae 2 to 10 mm thick, 14 to 20 cm apart; color of lamellae is red (2.5YR 4/6); lamellae texture is loamy fine sand with 2 to 3 percent more clay than the matrix; few distinct clay films bridging between sand grains; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (Thickness of the E and Bt2 horizon is 0 to 38 cm [0 to 15 in]) 

   C1--109 to 167 cm (43 to 66 in); reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) sand, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) crushed moist; structureless, single grain; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and few coarse roots throughout; few lamellae less than 2 mm thick, 3 to 7 cm apart; color of lamellae is red (2.5YR 4/6); lamellae are discontinuous; lamellae texture is loamy fine sand with 2 to 3 percent more clay than the matrix; sand grains are coated with silicate clay but no bridging between sand grains; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary. 

   C2--167 to 223 cm (66 to 88 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sand, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) crushed moist; structureless, single grain; loose, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; some faint cross bedding; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the C horizons is 50 to 140 cm (20 to 55 in)]  

TYPE LOCATION: Woods County, Oklahoma, about 5 miles east and 2 miles north of Waynoka. About 1000 feet west and 550 feet south of the northeast corner of Sec. 34, T. 25 N, R. 15 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Solum thickness: 61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 in) 
Free carbonates: below a depth of 102 cm (40 in) 

Reaction: the solum ranges from moderately acid to neutral 

Other features: The illuvial horizons contain less than 3 percent more clay than the overlying eluvial horizon. Where lamellae are present, combined thickness of lamellae which are 1 cm or thicker, is less than 15 cm (6 in). 

A horizon: 
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR

E and Bt horizon: 
Hue: 5YR to 10YR 
Value: 4 to 7, 4 or 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 8 
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand that contains less than 3 percent more clay than the A horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: The Derby series is the only competing series in this family. 
Derby soils: have albic and argillic horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: formed in sandy eolian deposits, usually many feet thick
Landscape: alluvial plains
Landform: undulating to rolling dunes on sand sheets
Slope: 0 to 15 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 559 to 787 mm (22 to 31 in)
Frost-free period: 190 to 230 days
Elevation:  300 to 790 m (1,000 to 2,600 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual PE Indices: 32 to 52

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carman, Carwile, Devol, Lovedale, Meno, Ruella, Tivoli and Waynoka soils. 
Carman and Lovedale soils: have mollic surfaces and have fine-loamy control sections 
Carwile soils: are fine textured, and are in nearby depressions 
Devol soils: have coarse-loamy control sections and are on slightly less undulating topography 
Meno soils: have redoximorphic features in the soil profile 
Tivoli soils: are on steeper slopes and have less developed profiles 
Waynoka soils: have a lithologic discontinuity within the soil profile 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: somewhat excessively  
Permeability: rapid
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 5 percent slopes, and very low on 5 to 15 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: Less sloping areas are usually cultivated; wheat is the principal crop with lesser acreage of grain sorghum and alfalfa. Steeper slopes are mostly in native range. Native vegetation is dominated by sand bluestem, Indiangrass, and little bluestem. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR-H-Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA-78C) and Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A) North-central and western Oklahoma, southern Kansas and adjacent parts of the Texas Panhandle. The series is of large extent.
