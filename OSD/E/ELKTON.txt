Othello soils--poorly drained mineral soils that have a fine-silty particle-size control section with 18 to 27 percent clay and sola less than 40 inches thick, on higher landforms

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Coastal Plain
Landform: Low-lying uplands, lowlands, and ancient floodplains
Elevation: 2 to 200 feet
Parent Material: Silty eolian material underlain by loamy alluvial or marine sediments
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F.
Mean Annual Precipitation: 42 to 48 inches
Frost Free Period: 190 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Othello soils--poorly drained mineral soils that have a fine-silty particle-size control section with 18 to 27 percent clay and sola less than 40 inches thick, on higher landforms
Fallsington soils--have a fine-loamy particle-size control section, on similar landforms
Leonardtown soils--have a fragipan, on similar landforms
Honga soils--very poorly drained and have organic materials at a depth of 16 to 51 inches, on lower-lying landforms
Kentuck soils--very poorly drained and have an umbric epipedon, on lower-lying landforms
Keyport soils--moderately well drained and have a fine particle-size control section, on higher landforms
Mattapex soils--moderately well drained, on higher landforms

USE: Mostly woodland. Adequately drained areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, and small grain crops.  Some areas are grazed, but there is little improved pasture.

VEGETATION: Native vegetation in the overstory is red maple, sweetgum, willow oak, blackgum, and loblolly pine.  Common understory species are greenbrier, American holly, waxmyrtle, and sweetbay.

DISTRIBUTION: Coastal Plain of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey

EXTENT: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cecil County, Maryland, 1900

REMARKS: These soils were previously classified as having a clayey particle-size control section.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 inches (A, Eg, and BEg horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
