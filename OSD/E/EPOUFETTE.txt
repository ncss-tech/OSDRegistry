EPOUFETTE SERIES

The Epoufette series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in stratified sandy and gravelly deposits. These soils are on glacial lake plains, moraines and outwash plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters (27 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Mollic Endoaqualfs

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are forested.  Predominate species include red maple, northern white cedar, quaking aspen, balsam poplar, black spruce, yellow birch, and balsam fir.  Some areas have been cleared and used for pasture.  Small areas have been drained and cultivated for small grain.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanilac County, Michigan, 1955.

REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from 33 to 46 centimeters (Btg horizon);
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters (A, Eg, Btg,Cg)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 33 centimeters (13 inches) (A and Eg horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 33 centimeters (4 to 13 inches) (Eg horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 46 centimeters (13 to 18 inches) (Btg horizon);
aquic moisture regime.

The typical pedon has been moved to the Lake Agassiz basin of northern Minnesota to better reflect the central concept of the series.  There is question in regard to the soil temperature regime of the previous type location in Arenac County, Michigan.  There is also question in regard to the relationship of the closely related Sahkahtay series in northern Minnesota.
