ETINARG SERIES

The Etinarg series consists of very shallow and shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granite. Etinarg soils are on mountains and have slopes of 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  On Dalvord-Etinarg association, 15 to 50 percent slopes at an elevation of 4,440 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by approximately 75 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones.

    A1 -- 0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial, and few fine and medium tubular pores; 75 percent gravels, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A2 -- 2 to 4 inches;  brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial, and few fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravels, 10 percent cobbles, and 3 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt1 -- 4 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; 90 percent continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds, lining pores, and on sands and gravel; 50 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear broken boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2 -- 10 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; 90 percent continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores, 50 percent discontinuous distinct clay films on sands and gravel; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and trace stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt broken boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    R -- 14 inches; moderately hard granitic bedrock; 50 percent discontinuous distinct clay films on rock faces.

TYPE LOCATION: San Bernardino County, California; about 16 miles north-northeast of cantonment area, Fort Irwin, California; 4 kilometers north of Granite Pass and 3.5 kilometers south of Drinkwater Lake in the Granite Mountains in a non-sectionalized area, T. 16 N., R. 4 E.; 35 degrees, 27 minutes, 46 seconds north latitude and 116 degrees, 32 minutes, 34 seconds west longitude; USGS Drinkwater Lake, Calif. quadrangle; UTM 11S, 0541482e 3924275n (DTM:NAS-C).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Downeyville (NV), Hoot (NV), Mirkwood (NV), Theon (NV), Tognoni (NV), Valleycity (UT), Vium (NV) and Waucoba (CA) series. Downeyville, Hoot, Mirkwood, Theon, Tognoni, Valleycity and Waucoba soils do not have 35 to 65 percent fine gravels to total gravels ratio. Downeyville soils are calcareous in some part and moderately alkaline and strongly alkaline. Hoot soils have a soil temperature of 47 to 53 degrees F. Mirkwood soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments. Theon soils average 25 to 35 percent clay. Tognoni soils average 25 to 35 percent clay and is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Valleycity soils have a BCk horizon and formed in calcareous sandstone and shale. Vium soils have calcareous, moderately alkaline, 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 8 to 16 percent clay in the control section. Waucoba soils are 14 to 20 inches deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Etinarg soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite. Elevations are 3,500 to 5,300 feet. The climate is arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 8 inches; mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Dalvord series. Dalvord soils have MAST greater than 59 degrees and Dalvord soils do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Etinarg soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, California buckwheat, pine bluegrass and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California, confined to included areas of higher elevations in MLRA 30 with characteristics of MLRA 29. These soils are of moderate extent in MLRA 30.
