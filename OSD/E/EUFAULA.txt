EUFAULA SERIES

The Eufaula series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on stabilized dunes on reworked stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A) and Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 820 mm (32 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Siliceous, thermic Psammentic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eufaula loamy fine sand-cultivated, at an elevation of 259 m, (850 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 30 cm [3 to 12 in])

    E1--15 to 102 cm (6 to 40 in); pink (7.5YR 7/4) fine sand; light brown (7.5YR 6/4); moist; single grain; loose; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Thickness of the E horizon is 61 to 152 cm [24 to 60 in])

    E2 and Bt--102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in); pink (7.5YR 7/4) fine sand, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist (E2); single grain; loose; with lamellae of yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand (Bt); the lamellae are massive; slightly hard, friable; wavy and discontinuous 4 to 25 mm (1/8 inch to 1 inch) thick and 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) apart; the lamellae have clay bridges between the sand grains; moderately acid.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum depth: greater than 183 cm (72 in)

A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 7, 4 OR 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

E1 horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 8, dry or moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

E2 and Bt horizon:
E2 Part
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 8, dry or moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

Bt horizon Part
Hue: 2.5YR to 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 4 to 8, dry or moist
Texture: loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam, but the control section averages loamy fine sand
Other features: The Bt horizons that are continuous horizontally and vertically are less common than the Bt horizons of lamellae.  Where present, the upper part of the continuous Bt horizon is loamy fine sand.  This horizon is dominantly massive, but some pedons have weak subangular blocky structure in the thicker lamellae or in the continuous Bt horizons.
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Joiner (MLRA 87A) series in the same family. Soils in similar families in MLRA 80A are the Aline and Goltry series.
Aline soils: have mixed mineralogy
Goltry soils: redox depletions between 30 and 60 inches of the surface and have a water table within 152 cm (60 in) of the surface
Joiner soils: have a continuous argillic horizon, do not have lamellae, and are in a warmer climate

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in sandy eolian sediments of Pleistocene age
Landscape: dunes
Landform: stabilized dunes on reworked stream terraces 
Slopes: 0 to 25 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 635 to 1041 cm (25 to 41 in)
Mean annual temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 65 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 198 to 473 m (650 to 1550 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dougherty, Galey, Konawa, Noble, Stephenville, and Stidham series.  
Dougherty and Konawa soils: on the lower half of backslopes and on foot slopes. In addition, Konawa soils have a loamy control section and a thinner combined A and E horizon.
Noble soils: on foot slopes that are lower and they do not have argillic horizons
Stephenville soils: on hillslopes and are 50 to 103 cm (20 to 40 in) thick over sandstone bedrock
Stidham and Galey soils: on higher terraces and have a loamy control section

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: somewhat excessively
Permeability: rapid
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high
Runoff: negligible on 0 to 3 percent slopes, medium on 3 to 8 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dominantly used for range.  Considerable amounts of the loamy fine sand on lesser slopes are cropped to sorghums, small grains, and peanuts; or used for tame pastures. Native vegetation is post oak and blackjack oak with an understory of mid and tall grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area: central Oklahoma, central Texas, and south central Kansas 
Land Resource Region: H-Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region, and J-Southwestern Prairies Cotton and Forage Region 
MLRA 80A-Central Rolling Red Prairies, MLRA 84A-North Cross Timbers 
Extent: large
