ESCOBAS SERIES

The Escobas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sands over calcareous loamy alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on the vegetated sand sheet. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 23 degress C (73 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).

COMPETING SERIES: There are the no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Brennan (TX), Comitas (TX), Hebbronville (TX), Julesburg (CO) Nueces (TX),  Salco (T-TX),  Tela (TX), and Vitrina (NM) series. 
Brennan, Salco, and Tela soils: have fine-loamy particle size control sections.
Comitas and Nueces soils: surface textures coarser than loamy very fine sand that extend to depths of more than 51 cm (20 in).
Hebbronville soils: have an ochric epipedon.
Julesburg and Vitrina soils: have a mesic soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian sands over calcareous loamy sediments.
Landform: vegetated sand sheet.
Slope: 0 to 5 percent.
Mean annual air temperature range: 22 to 23 degrees C (72 to 74 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation range: 508 to 584 mm (20 to 23 in)
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly rainfall occurs during the spring and fall month. The summer months are normally dry with infrequent showers. December and January are usually the driest months.
Frost-free period: 290 to 320 days.
Elevation: 107 to 145 m (350 to 475 ft).
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 20 to 28. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brennan, Comitas, Hebbronville, Nueces, and Sarita series. 
All these soils have an ochric epipedon.
Brennan soils: fine-loamy particle size control section and are on similar to slightly higher positions.
Comitas, Nueces, and Sarita soils: surface texture coarser than loamy fine sand that extend to depth of more than 51 cm (20 in) and are on similar or slightly higher positions.
Hebbronville soils: do not have a mollic surface and are on similar to slightly higher positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as rangeland and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation consists of four-flower trichloris, Arizona cottontop, Plains bristlegrass, hooded windmillgrass, pink pappusgrass and woody shrubs such as mesquite, pricklypear, Texas ebony, tasajillo, and spiny hackberry. The ecological site is Sandy Loam, 25-35 PZ (R083EY702TX).
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sandsheet Prairie, Texas, LRR I; MLRA 83E; the series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Zapata County, Texas, in 2009. This series was proposed in Zapata County, Texas, 2000. The name is comes from a small community in eastern Zapata County, Texas.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Hebbronville series. The Hebbronville series has an ochric epipedon.
 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 28 to 79 cm (11 to 31 in) (Bt horizons). 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in) (A horizon). 
Argillic horizon: 28 to 127 cm (11 to 50 in) (Bt horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Particle-size analysis, calcium carbonate equivalent, sieve analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 3 pedons. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from geographically associated soils.
