GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - till plains.

Elevation - 2,200 to 4,000 feet.

Slopes - 0 to 15 percent.

Parent material - calcareous till.

Climate - cool with long, cold winters; moist springs; hot, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 15 inches, most of which falls during spring and early in summer.

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free season - 100 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Slow or very slow permeability in the solum, and very slow permeability in the underlying till.  Runoff is low to very high depending on slope and permeability of the surface.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as dryland farmland and as rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, green needlegrass, blue grama, Nuttall saltbush, greasewood, and other shrubs and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Elloam soils occur in north-central and northeastern Montana on the till plains.  They are extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Blaine County, Montana, 1976.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0272, MT0608.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the to a depth of 3 inches (E horizon); natric horizon - the zone from 3 to 18 inches (Btn1, Btn2 and part of Bkn horizon); natric horizon - the zone from 3 to 10 inches that is also the particle-size control section (Btn1 and Btn2 horizons); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation - the zone from 10 to 43 inches (Bkn and Bknyz horizons).  Elloam soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
