EBERT SERIES

The Ebert series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in terrace deposits derived from basalt. Ebert soils are on relict terrace deposits. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Petrocalcic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Maryrussell-Ebert complex (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 1 inch (0 to 4 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/2), loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common irregular pores; few very fine roots throughout; 2 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary

     Bt--1 to 10 inches (4 to 25 cm); brown (7.5YR 4/3), clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky; moderately hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine irregular pores; common very fine roots throughout; 10 percent gravel; very slight effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary

     Bk--10 to 17 inches (25 to 42 cm); brown (7.5YR 5/3), clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, very sticky, very plastic; few irregular pores; few medium roots throughout; 40 percent gravel; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary

     Bkm--17 to 19 inches (42 to 49 cm); cemented material; petrocalcic materials

     R--19 to 29 inches (49 to 74 cm); basalt bedrock

Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist 

COMPETING SERIES: None.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: terrace deposits derived from basalt
Landform: weathered lava fields
Slopes: 1 to 8 percent
Elevation: 5,200 to 7,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 48 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 18 inches
Precipitation peaks in July and August, and in winter months.  May and June are much drier.
Frost-free period: 120 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Maryrussell, Ashfork, and Dogpaws soils. Maryrussell soils do not have a petrocalcic.  Maryrussell soils are in the deeper soils of terraces.  Ashfork and Dogpaws soils are in residuum of lava fields.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, moderately rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally as grazing land. Native vegetation is mainly blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, and broom snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. MLRA 39.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Coconino County, Arizona.
