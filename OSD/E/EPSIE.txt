EPSIE SERIES

The Epsie series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 3 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, calcareous, mesic, shallow Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Epsie clay, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    E--0 to 2 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1 and 6/1) clay, light gray (5Y 6/1) moist; weak very fine platy structure parting to strong very fine granular with a thin vesicular surface crust that has a thickness range of 1/4 to 1 inch; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bky--2 to 18 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; few pores; common medium seams and rounded soft nodules of lime and gypsum below 6 inches with few fine and medium seams and soft masses of gypsum above 6 inches; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick)

    Cr--18 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2), olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) semiconsolidated shale that crushes to clay; few fine roots and gypsum crystals in cracks and between plates in the upper few inches; noncalcareous; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - hills, sedimentary plains.

Elevation - 2,300 to 3,600 feet.

Slope - 3 to 45 percent.

Parent material - residuum derived from semiconsolidated shale.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and hot, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 16 inches.

Mean annual temperature - is 45 to 52 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 105 to 150 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Epsie soils are used mainly as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, thickspike wheatgrass, Nuttall saltbush, greasewood, and sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Epsie soils are of moderate extent in southeastern Montana and western South Dakota.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Butte County, South Dakota, 1970.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT0443.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a paralithic contact at a depth of 18 inches; a particle-size control section from 10 inches to the paralithic contact (Bky horizon).  Epsie soils have a mesic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

Classification changed from Ustic Torriorthents to Aridic Ustorthents in 1995.
