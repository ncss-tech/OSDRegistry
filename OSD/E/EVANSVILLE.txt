EVANSVILLE SERIES

The Evansville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in stratified silty sediments of Wisconsinan Age and are on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Evansville silt loam - on nearly level topography in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 117 meters (385 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

	Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. [15 to 28 cm (6 to 11 inches) thick] 

	Bg1--23 to 53 cm (9 to 21 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; few dark gray (10YR 4/1) organic coatings on faces of peds; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; clear wavy boundary. 

	Bg2--53 to 81 cm (21 to 32 inches); olive gray (5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; common dark gray (5Y 4/1) organic coatings on faces of peds; common medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; clear smooth boundary. 

	Bg3--81 to 112 cm (32 to 44 inches); olive gray (5Y 5/2) silt clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; common dark gray (5Y 4/1) organic coatings in channels and on faces of peds; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bg horizons is 61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches)] 

	Cg--112 to 168 cm (44 to 66 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) stratified silt loam and silty clay loam; firm; massive; slightly alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Vanderburgh County, Indiana; about 2 miles east of Smythe, 1060 feet south and 530 feet west of the NE corner of sec. 19, T. 6 S., R. 9 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the base of the cambic horizon: 89 to 140 cm (35 to 55 inches) but is dominantly 102 to 127 cm (40 to 50 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: The Akan series is the only competing series.  The Akan soils have red mottles in the Bg horizon and bluish gray or greenish gray colors at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches) and have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Evansville soils are on nearly level lake plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. Evansville soils formed in stratified silty lacustrine sediments of Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 degrees to 57 degrees F), mean annual soil temperature ranges from 13 to 15 degrees C (55 degrees to 59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation from 1016 to 1219 mm (40 to 48 inches). Frost free period ranges from 180 to 215 days. Elevation ranges from 110 to 183 meters (360 to 600 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Henshaw, Ragsdole, Uniontown, McGary, Montgomery, Patton, Yeddo and Zipp soils. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Patton, Montgomery, and Ragsdale soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower parts of flats and depressions and the Montgomery soils also have more clay in the subsoil. Zipp soils are on nearly level to depressional areas and contain more clay. The somewhat poorly drained Henshaw, McGary and Yeddo soils, the moderately well drained Uniontown soils are on more sloping terrace positions, are deeper to zones of saturation, and have argillic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. An intermittent apparent high water table is at the surface to 30 centimeters (1 foot) below the surface from December to April in normal years. This soil is subject to periods of frequent, very brief ponding at depths up to 15 cm (0.5 foot) from December to May in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec). Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2.0 inches per hour).  

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are cropped principally to corn and soybeans. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Indiana and southern Illinois. The extent is moderate in MLRAs 114B and 115A. The type location is in MLRA 115A.
