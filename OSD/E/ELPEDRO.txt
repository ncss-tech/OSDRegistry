ELPEDRO SERIES

The Elpedro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in Colluvium, alluvium and eolian materials derived from limestone and siltstone on fan piedmonts, mesas, benches, valley sides, low hills, alluvial flats and rolling plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Elpedro loam, wooded. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

       A--0 to 5 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

       Bt1--5 to 12 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) silty clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and coarse roots; few thin discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

       Bt2--12 to 19 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and coarse roots, thin discontinuous clay films on face of peds; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

       Bt3--19 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; thick continuous clay films on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; very few calcium carbonate seams and filaments; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

       Btk1--25 to 36 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; thick continuous clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; thin coat and filaments of calcium carbonates on faces of peds; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

       Btk2--36 to 45 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate seams and filaments on faces of peds; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

       Btk3--45 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; thin discontinuous clay film on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; few calcium carbonate accumulations; slightly alkaline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elpedro soils are on fan piedmonts, low hills, mesas, benches, valley sides, alluvial flats and rolling plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,450 to 7,800 feet.  The soils formed in eolian materials, alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone and siltstone.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Witt series.  Witt soils have a calcic horizon and an aridic soil moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for range, wildlife habitat, fuelwood production, recreation, and urban development.  Native vegetation is pinyon, juniper species, rubber rabbitbrush, western wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountain foothills of central New Mexico.  These soils are of small extent. MLRAs 35 & 36.
