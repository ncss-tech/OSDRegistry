EAST LAKE SERIES

The East Lake series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly outwash on outwash plains, stream terraces, lake terraces, lake basins, deltas, eskers, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: East Lake sand, on a 1 percent slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A--0 to 2 cm (0 to 1 inch); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sand, brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; about 1 percent fine and medium gravel; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 13 cm (5 inches) thick]

 E--2 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; about 1 percent fine and medium gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [2 to 15 cm (1 to 6 inches) thick]

 Bs1--10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and medium and few coarse roots; 10 percent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8 and 4/6) weakly cemented ortstein occurring as columns 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 inches) wide extending into the BC horizon; about 1 percent fine and medium gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bs2--20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine and medium roots; 10 percent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8 and 4/6) weakly cemented ortstein occurring as columns 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 inches) wide; about 2 percent fine and medium gravel; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

 Bs3--46 to 53 cm (18 to 21 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; 5 percent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) weakly cemented ortstein occurring as columns 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 inches) wide; about 2 percent fine and medium gravel; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 23 to 61 cm (9 to 24 inches).]

 BC--53 to 79 cm (21 to 31 inches); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 2 percent fine and medium gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 25 cm [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 2C--79 to 203 cm (31 to 80 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) stratified very gravelly coarse sand and coarse sand; single grain; loose; 36 percent fine and medium gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Duel, Hartwick, Ishpeming, Karlin, Kiva,  Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner, and Sultz series. Duel and Ishpeming soils are underlain by bedrock at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Hartwick soils contain less than 25 percent gravel below 102 cm (40 inches). Karlin, Rousseau, and Rubicon, soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the series control section. Kiva soils have more than 10 percent cobbles in the lower part of the series control section. Sayner soils do not have carbonates within the control section. Sultz soils are underlain with stratified materials. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The East Lake soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, lake terraces, lake basins, deltas, eskers, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to about 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the excessively drained to well drained Alpena, Eastport, Kalkaska, Kiva, Mancelona, and Rubicon soils. They occur on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and Gladwin soils and the poorly drained Epoufette, Roscommon, and Wheatley soils are wetter associates. They occur on lower landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A small part is used for growing hay, oats, and potatoes. The remainder is in permanent pasture or forest, or is idle. Common tree species are quaking aspen, jack pine, northern red oak, paper birch, red pine, and red maple. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 94C, 96, and 98 in northern Lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
