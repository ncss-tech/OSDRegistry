EDLOE SERIES

The Edloe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from granite, gneiss, or monzonite.  Edloe soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 20 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Edloe very gravelly sandy loam, on a north facing, 45 percent slope in woodland at an elevation of 8700 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 8, 1983 the soil was moist.

       Oe--0 to 2 inches; moderately decomposed plant material.

       A--2 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; 3 percent stones and 5 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

       E1--4 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3), very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; 5 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

       E2--10 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3), very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, nonplastic; 5 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the E horizons is 10 to 18 inches)

       Bt--20 to 32 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, hard, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; few faint clay films on all faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles and 50 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 25 inches thick)

       R--32 to 60 inches; indurated gneiss bedrock.

Cloud Peak, Hyattville, Kimpton- have accumulations of secondary calcium carbonate.
Guffey, Tepecreek - have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.
Lake Creek - have rock fragments that are mainly stones of sandstone and argillite.
Lakehelen - are not as dry in the moisture control section in early summer and are not as moist in mid and late summer.
Laveta - have rock fragments of sandstone.
Lulude - have rock fragments of volcanic origin and have E/B horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, monzonite

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, 2010.  The name is taken from a small store in Teller County.  The 02/2010 revision re-activates and re-describes the formerly inactive Edloe series. The original Edloe series was proposed in 1943 and established in 1959 with a type location on the Manitou Experimental Forest, Teller County. The classification was fine-loamy mixed Typic Cryoboralfs. This series was not recognized in a current soil survey, and was inactivated in 2009. A very similar soil was recognized in the Teller-Park soil survey, and the Edloe series name was reactivated and used for the series proposed in the Teller-Park Area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
