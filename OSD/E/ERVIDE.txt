ERVIDE SERIES

The Ervide series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial or eolian material deposited over lake sediments, underlain by sandstone.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ervide loamy fine sand, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 17 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); diffuse boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    BC--17 to 23 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; 5 percent sandstone pebbles; few lime coated sandstone fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    2Ck--23 to 32 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; very hard, friable, sticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine pores; 20 percent sandstone pebbles; many prominent lime coatings on surface of pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    R--32 inches; indurated sandstone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - uplands.
Elevation - 3,000 to 4,300 feet.  
Slope - 0 to 8 percent.
Parent material - sandy alluvium or eolian material deposited over lake sediments underlain by sandstone.
Climate - long, cold winters, moist springs, and warm summers.  
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 18 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and moderate in the 2C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ervide soils are used for dryland cropland and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly prairie sandreed, little bluestem, sand dropseed, and yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ervide soils are of small extent in north-central and eastern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cascade County Area, Montana, 1975.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0036.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 17 inches (Ap, Bw horizons); no cambic or argillic horizon; a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches or 10 inches to the lithic contact (Bw, BC, 2Ck horizons).  Entic Haploborolls feature a mollic epipedon and no cambic horizon.  Ervide soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
