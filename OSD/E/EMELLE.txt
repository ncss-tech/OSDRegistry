EMELLE SERIES

The Emelle series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from calcareous shale. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 6 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Emelle loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 8 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 cm thick)

 Bk1--8 to 26 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; finely disseminated carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.

 Bk2--26 to 50 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; common fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 2 percent carbonate masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons 30 to 50 cm)

 Bk3--50 to 88 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky, very plastic; common fine roots throughout; common fine irregular pores; 5 percent carbonate masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (35 to 44 cm thick)

 BCk--88 to 127 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; common fine roots in cracks; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent carbonate masses in matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 50 cm thick)

 C--127 to 200 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; moderately hard, very firm, slightly sticky, moderately plastic; common fine irregular pores; finely disseminated carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
