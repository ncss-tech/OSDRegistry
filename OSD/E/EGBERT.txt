EGBERT SERIES

The Egbert series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Egbert soils are in basins of river deltas and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Egbert silty clay loam - on a West facing slope of less than 1 percent under cropland at 0.9 meter (3 feet) below sea level.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) redox concentrations, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.

Mean annual soil temperature: 16.5 degrees C.  
Organic matter: averages 2 to 10 percent, strata 1/4 to 2 inches thick may be present that have 10 to 50 percent organic matter
Clay content: 35 to 50 percent
Other features: some pedons have thin layers with concentrations of red concretions giving a gravelly or gritty feel.  These layers with concretions have low bulk density.

A horizon:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gazwell, and Peltier.  Gazwell soils have a buried Histosol within 102 centimeters (40 inches).  Peltier soils have weighted average of 10 to 25 percent organic matter in the 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inch) zone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Egbert soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains, in backswamps or basins of river deltas.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium weathered from mixed sources.  Elevations are 4.6 meters (15 feet) above to 3 meters (10 feet) below sea level.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 254 to 457 millimeters (10 to 18 inches).  Mean January temperature is 8 degrees C (47 degrees F); mean July temperature is 24 degrees C (76 degrees F); mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 17 degrees C (59 to 62 degrees F).  The frost-free season ranges from 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Peltier and Ryde soils and the Dierssen, Gazwell, Merritt, Sacramento, Scribner and Valpac soils. Dierssen soils have a hardpan between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  Gazwell soils have an organic layer between 71 and 99 centimeters (28 and 39 inches).  Merritt soils lack redoximorphic features in the mollic epipedon.  Sacramento soils have cracks in the upper part and have a very fine textural control section.  Scribner and Valpac soils have fine-loamy 25 to 100 centimeter (10 to 40 inch) control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow or slow runoff; slow permeability (sandy substratum phase has rapid permeability below a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches)).  Levees and drains are required to control both surface and subsurface water.  Drained areas have a water table within 91 and 183 centimeters (3 to 6 feet) during the growing season.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for irrigated cropland.  The principal crops are sugar beets, tomatoes, safflower, alfalfa, barley, corn and milo.  Principal native plants are annual grasses, forbs and several members of the rush and sedge families.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in the lower end of the Sacramento Valley.  The series is of small extent in MLRA-14, 16, 17.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Solano County, California, Suisun Area, 1930.

REMARKS:  Egbert soils as mapped in the 1977 Contra Costa Co. SSA are now excluded from this revised concept.  The pH values in typical pedon were described when the soil was moist.

The activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were checked in 2016 - ET.

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 79 centimeters (31 inches) (Ap, A)

Mineralogy is assumed to be mixed.

Cumulic subgroup - the mollic epipedon is greater than 60 centimeters (24 inches) thick and the organic carbon decreases irregularly with increasing depth.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil was laboratory sampled as 15N0731 (S2015CA067002).
