ESMOD SERIES

The Esmod series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with eolian surficial additions of volcanic ash.  Esmod soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey, smectitic, mesic, shallow Abruptic Xeric Argidurids

    Bqkm2--71 to 91 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) cemented material, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; weak medium and thick platy structure; very hard, extremely firm and very firm; strongly and weakly cemented by silica and carbonates; alternate horizontal discontinuous 0.5 to 2 mm silica laminae; common fine and medium horizontal masses of secondary carbonates; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).  (20 to 48 cm thick)

    Bqkm3--91 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) cemented material, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm; weakly and strongly cemented by silica and carbonates; common less than 0.5 mm discontinuous silica laminae; many 1 to 5 mm horizontal masses of secondary carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; south of Bitner Table about 2 miles west of the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge boundary; about 2,00 feet south and 200 feet east of the northwest corner section 23, T. 43 N., R. 22 E.; USGS Badger Mountain NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 38 minutes 2.6 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 28 minutes 47.7 seconds west longitude; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.6340556 latitude, -119.4790833 longitude.
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry mid-June through October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to duripan:36 to 50 cm.
Abrupt textural change: An abrupt horizon boundary is normally present between the A2 horizon and the Bt horizon accompanied by an increase in clay content of more than 20 percent.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 40 to 50 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Antholop, Fulstone, Grassycan, Kunaton, Puls, Riddenbaugh, and Rogerson series.

Antholop soils are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in the Bt horizons and are moist for 10 to 20 days between July and October.  Fulstone soils have very strongly cemented or indurated duripans.  Grassycan, Kunaton, and Puls soils have a duripan over bedrock that is within 100 cm.  Riddenbaugh soils have moderately alkaline Bt horizons and Bk horizons immediately above the duripan.  Rogerson soils have a duripan that is less than 100 cm thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Esmod soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with eolian surficial additions of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,670 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Powlow soil.  Powlow soils have Mollic epipedons and are on adjacent slope positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Esmod soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, bluegrass, and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
