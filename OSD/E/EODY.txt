EODY SERIES

The Eody series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium.  Eody soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 50 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eody loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium, many fine and very fine roots; few fine interstitial and vesicular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bw1--10 to 28 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure, hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

    Bw2--28 to 69 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive, very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Bw1, Bw2 is 20 to 100 cm)

    C--69 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive, very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  None listed.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape - mountain slopes
Elevation - 2,470 to 2,960 meters  
Slopes - 50 to 80 percent  
Parent material - colluvium
Mean annual precipitation - 630 to 711 mm 
Mean annual air temperature - 1.7 to 4.4 degrees C. 
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Eody soils are used mainly for wood production and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is spruce-fir forest, including Englemann spruce, white fir, Douglas fir and Colorado blue spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central New Mexico and south-central Colorado. LRR D, E; MLRA 36, 48A; small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, 1989

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Cambic horizon:  10 to 69 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons) based on the higher color value than an overlying horizon and the lack structure.
Particle-size control section:  25 to 100 cm (part of Bw1, Bw2, and part of C horizon).

The moisture regime and subclass was unclear as of the 2006 revision. It is assumed to be a udic regime bordering ustic, but may possibly be ustic. Further study is needed to resolve this issue.  Currently, Eody soils have a cryic temperature regime and are in a udic soil moisture regime bordering on ustic.

When established, the Eody series was classified as fine, mixed, nonacid Typic Cryorthents.
