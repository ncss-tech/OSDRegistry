ETOWN SERIES

The Etown series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvial and alluvial material derived from sandstone and shale.  Etown soils are on mountain slopes.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Udic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Etown gravelly loam - forested -- in a mountainous area, backslope position. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    O -- 2 to 0 inches; Forest litter in various stages of decomposition.

    A -- 0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 25 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

(5 to 23 inches thick)

    Bt/E -- 18 to 30 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; E part about 20 percent pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loam (7.5YR 4/2) most as coatings on rock fragments and faces of peds; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; many thin and thick clay films on rocks; 30 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 18 inches thick)

    Bt1 -- 30 to 46 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) extremely cobbly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; many pressure faces; many thick clay films on surfaces of rocks; 25 percent pebbles, 40 percent cobbles; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2 -- 46 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely stony clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; common pressure faces; common moderately thick clay films on ped faces and rocks; 40 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Colfax County, New Mexico; 36 degrees 26 minutes 14 seconds north latitude and 105 degrees 20 minutes 0 seconds west longitude; about 10 miles south-southwest of Eagle Nest and 1.5 miles north of junction of US Highway 65 and the Colfax-Taos county line.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - In most years the soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days in the 4 months that follow the summer solstice.

Soil temperature: 40 to 46 degrees.

A horizons - Hue: 7.5YR.
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: gravelly loam.
Rock fragments - 15 to 35 percent total, 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble.

E horizons - Hue: 7.5YR.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: very gravelly loam .
Rock fragments - 40 to 60 percent total, 40 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble.

B/E horizons - Hue: 7.5YR.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 4.
Texture: very gravelly clay loam.
Rock fragments - 40 to 60 percent total, 15 to 30 percent gravel, 15 to 25 percent cobble, 5 to 15 percent stones


Bt horizons - Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 to 6.
Texture:  Extremely gravelly clay, very cobbly clay or very gravelly clay.
Clay content:  greater than 40 percent.
Rock fragment content:  35 to 80 percent total, 25 to 40 percent gravel, 15 to 40 percent cobble 0 to 20 percent stones.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alanos (NM), Crest (T NM), Pinata (NM) and Trampas series.  The Alanos soils contain iron and manganese concretions in the upper Bt horizons and have mainly pebble and cobble-size rock fragments.  Crest soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Pinata soils have argillic horizons within 24 inches of the mineral soil surface.  Trampas soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the Bt and C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Etown soils are on mountain slopes, primarily backslope positions.  They formed in mixed colluvial and alluvial material derived from sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.   Elevation ranges from 9,000 to 11,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 27 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Angostura and Etoe soils.  Angostura soils have a cryic temperature regime.  Etoe soils have a loamy-skeletal section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium and rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Etown soils are used for wildlife habitat, woodland, recreation and watershed.  Present vegetation is Douglas fir, white fir, and aspen with an understory of shrubs and mountain grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Etown soils are of small extent in northern New Mexico. MLRA 48.
