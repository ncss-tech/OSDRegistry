EDALGO SERIES

The Edalgo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or loess over residuum weathered from clayey shale.  Edalgo soils are on hillslopes on uplands in Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74. Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 790 millimeters (31 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Saline County, Kansas, 1952.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 12 to 21 inches.  (2Bt horizon)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches).  (A and BA horizons) 
Argillic horizon: The zone from 30 to 53 centimeters (12 to 21 inches).  (2Bt horizon)
Paralithic contact: The contact with shale at 97 centimeters (38 inches). (2Cr horizon)
Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon.

The assignment of the CEC activity class is supported by KSSL sample number 79P0321 (pedon 79KS143002).

The shale bedrock is often a mixture of material that does not slake (paralithic material) and that does slake (densic material).  With some of the material not slaking it was determined to leave the horizonation as Cr rather than changing it Cd.

Other features: The mottles with chroma of 2 or less are inherited from the shale, and are not considered an indication of wetness.
