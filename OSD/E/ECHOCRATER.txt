ECHOCRATER SERIES 

The Echocrater series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and cinders. Echocrater soils are on south-facing slopes on cinder cones. Permeability is rapid.  Slopes range from 20 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal over fragmental or cindery, glassy, frigid Typic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Echocrater gravelly ashy loamy sand - on a 20 percent slope at an elevation of 6,500 feet in rangeland. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on June 17, 1997, the soil was dry. 

	A1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly ashy loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel-size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick) 

	A2--3 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly ashy loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots, common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel-size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick) 

	Bw--8 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel-size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

	2BC--15 to 25 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) very gravelly ashy loamy sand, black (10YR 2/1) moist; massive; loose; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, fine and few medium interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel-size cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick)

	2C--25 to 60 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravel, black (10YR 2/1) moist; single grained; loose; common very fine to medium and few coarse interstitial pores; 90 percent gravel-size cinders.

COMPETING SERIES: This are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Echocrater soils are on south-facing slopes on cinder cones. Elevation is 5,800 to 7,500 feet. Slopes are 20 to 40 percent. The soils are formed in recent ash and cinders from the Craters of the Moon volcanics. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches, most of which falls as snow. The average annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bigcinder, Infernocone, Northcrater soils and cinder land. Bigcinder soils are cryic and are on north-facing slopes associated with limber pine.  Infernocone soils have a mollic epipedon and are on north slopes.  Northcrater soils lack andic soil properties in the upper part of the profile. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Slow runoff. Rapid over very rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for wildlife and limited livestock grazing. Vegetation mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. This series is of limited extent.
