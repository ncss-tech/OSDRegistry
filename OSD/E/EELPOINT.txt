EELPOINT SERIES

The Eelpoint series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in fine alluvium derived from mixed rock sources resting on dacite or andesite.  Eelpoint soils are on hills and terraces and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 255 millimeters (10 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 16.5 degrees C. (62 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, thermic Sodic Haploxererts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eelpoint silt loam, on a 1 percent slope facing southwest under a cover of slender oats, stipa, clover, soft chess, filaree and Australian saltbush at an elevation of 350 meters (1,150 feet). (When described, on May 6, 1982 the soil was dry to 5 centimeters (2 inches), slightly moist to 33 centimeters (13 inches) and moist below.

  E--0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thick and very thick platy structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; 2 percent stones 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

  An--5 to 33 centimeters (2 to 13 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong medium and angular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few common wedge shape aggregates and few intersecting slickensides; SAR is 12; slightly acid (pH 6.5) gradual wavy boundary. (23 to 33 centimeters; 9 to 13 inches thick).

  Bnssy--33 to 91 centimeters (13 to 36 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, dark brown (7/5YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure; extremely hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; few intersecting slickensides and common wedge shape aggregates; few fine and medium soft masses of gypsum; SAR is 19; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt irregular boundary (25 to 64 centimeters; 10 to 25 inches thick).

  2R--91 to 116 centimeters (36 to 46 inches); hard andesite with few fractures 10 to 35 centimeters (4 to 14 inches) apart.

TYPE LOCATION:  San Clemente Island, Los Angeles County, California; about 1.13 miles going south from the intersection of Nanny Road and Main Road to a Y, turning right .78 miles south from Y and then 750 feet east to site.; 32.92181 degrees latitude, -118.50301 degrees longitude; UTM zone 11, 3643620.87n, 359464.71e; U.S.G.S. Quad Name: San Clemente Island Central, California.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
The mean annual soil temperature: 17 to 19 degrees C. (62 to 66 degrees F.)
Soil moisture and cracks: when dry, the soils form cracks about 2 to 50 mm wide 10 to 36 cm (4 to 14 inches) apart at a depth of 5 to 100 cm (2 to 40 inches) that open from about April to late November or early December and cracks remain closed the rest of the year.

Depth to lithic contact: 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to hard volcanic rock.
Vertic properties: few or common wedge shape aggregates and few intersecting slickensides from a depth of 33 centimeters (13 inches) to the lithic contact.
Clay content: 60 to 70 percent
Reaction is medium acid to neutral
Sodium absorption ration (SAR): 10 to 20 meq/L
Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP): 13 to 22 percent
Electrical conductivity (EC): less than 4 ds/m

E horizon: (where it occurs)
Texture: silt loam or cobbly/stony silt loam
Rock fragment content: 1 to 5 percent stones, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 10 percent gravel.

A horizon:
Dry color: 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 7.5YR 5/2 or 4/2
