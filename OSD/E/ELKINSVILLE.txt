ELKINSVILLE SERIES

The Elkinsville series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or silty sediments and the underlying loamy alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Ultic Hapludalfs

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bearthicket, Cidermill, Elk, Olephant, Parke, Pike, Rickert, Tobinsport, Wellrock, and Wellston series. Bearthicket, Elk and Rickert soils have less than 35 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Cidermill soils typically have more than 14 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section but the range does overlap with Elkinsville series. Olephant, Parke ,and Pike soils are deeper than 183 cm (72 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Wellrock soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Wellston soils have rock fragments of siltstone or sandstone lithology in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Elkinsville soils are on stream terraces or flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or silty sediments and the underlying loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 210 days. Elevation is 104 to 244 meters (340 to 800 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are primarily the Bartle, Millstone, Pekin, and Peoga soils on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. They are also associated with the Vincennes and Wheeling soils on stream terraces and flood-plain steps. The somewhat poorly drained Bartle and the poorly drained Peoga soils are on treads. The moderately well drained Pekin and well drained, fine-loamy Millstone soils are on treads and risers. The poorly drained Vincennes soils are on treads and on flood-plain steps. The well drained Wheeling soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate. Areas on flood-plain steps are subject to rare to occasional periods of flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are being used to grow corn, soybeans, and small grain, mainly wheat. A few areas are used for hay and pasture, and a few of the more sloping areas are used for forest. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 114A, 114B, 115A, 120B, 120C, 121, 122, and 124 in southern Indiana and Ohio. The type location is in MLRA 114A. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bartholomew County, Indiana, 1936.

REMARKS: This series is being differentiated from the Elk series based on the amount of sand in the lower part of the series control section. Some of the Elkinsville soils previously correlated will likely be re-correlated to the Elk series because the sand content is less than 35 percent in the lower part of the series control section. 

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface of the soil to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from 23 to 147 cm (9 to 58 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5 horizons).

Representative component and horizon data is in DMU# 120,077.
