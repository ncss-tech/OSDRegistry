EINE SERIES

The Eine series consists of very deep, poorly drained alkaline soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Argic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Eine loam, in rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; very dark brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 4 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Btn--4 to 8 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry, weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    BCn--8 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2)
very fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    2Cn1--12 to 20 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand , light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few medium tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary.

    2Cn2--20 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few medium tubular pores; 15 percent cobbles and 35 percent pebbles; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6).

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1733. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (A1, A2 and Btn horizons); an argillic horizon from 4 to 8 inches (Btn horizon); a lithologic discontinuity at 12 inches (2Cn1 horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (BCn, 2Cn1 and 2Cn2 horizons). Eine soils have a cryic temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
