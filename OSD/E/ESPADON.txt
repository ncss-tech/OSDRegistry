ESPADON SERIES

The Espadon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from limestone. Espadon soils are north facing backslopes of low hills and cuestas. Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Argiustolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Luckystrike, Resolana, Traley and Truehill series.  The Luckystrike, Resolana, Traley and Truehill soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Espadon soils are on north-facing backslopes of cuestas and low hills. They formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from limestone. Slopes are 10 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,400 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Desario soil. Desario soils are shallow, do not have argillic horizons, and occur on south facing backslopes of low hills. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Espadon soils are used for rural development, cord wood products, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is Gamble's oak, nedlegrass, twoneedle pinyon, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma/Quercus gambleii/Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB134NM)..

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Espadon soils are of small extent on Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
