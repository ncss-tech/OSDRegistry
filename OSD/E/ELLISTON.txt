ELLISTON SERIES

The Elliston series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Elliston loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--1 to 0 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

    A--0 to 7 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 44 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; many fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/8) redox concentrations; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; disseminated lime, few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 33 inches thick)

    2C--44 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; many fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/8) redox concentrations; massive; soft, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 40 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

Frost-free season - 70 to 90 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Elliston soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated pasture, and for timber production.  Native timber species are Engelman spruce, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain Juniper, plains cottonwood, and quaking aspen with an understory of common snowberry, woods rose, basin wildrye, prairie cordgrass, bearded wheatgrass, Rocky Mountain Iris, willows, and water birch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Elliston soils are inextensive in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Powell County, Montana, 1995.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1238.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 7 to 12 inches (Bw horizon); accumulation of lime from 12 to 44 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk horizons). Elliston soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
