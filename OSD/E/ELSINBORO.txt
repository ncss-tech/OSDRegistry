Texture (fine-earth fraction)-sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam

E horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam

Bt horizon:

Texture (fine-earth fraction)-loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam
Sandy clay loam is limited to 2Bt where present. The B horizon can have abrupt textural changes as a result of stratification.

BC or CB horizon:
