10/2016--The Elma series was inactive prior to 2016. It was re-established as part of an update project. The official series description was developed according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Further field investigation and laboratory sampling of the flood plains of glacially modified river valleys in MLRA 2 is recommended to determine the distribution and influence of volcanic ash.
