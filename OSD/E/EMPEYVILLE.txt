EMPEYVILLE SERIES

The Empeyville series are very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till. They are nearly level to moderately steep soils derived dominantly from acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Slope ranges from 1 through 25 percent. They have a fragipan. Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral soil is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high in the fragipan and substratum. Mean annual precipitation is about 1476 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other active series in this family.

The Crary, Howland, Peru, Skerry, Westbury, and Worth series are in related families. Crary soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the upper solum. Howland soils have silt plus very fine sand content of 55 percent or more throughout the solum and fragipan. Peru and Skerry soils lack fragipans. Westbury soils have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the spodic horizon. Worth soils lack redoximorphic features within 75 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Empeyville soils are nearly level through moderately steep soils of till plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 25 percent. The soils formed in till, which may have a thin silty mantle of eolian materials, derived dominantly from acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 to 1727 mm., mean annual  temperature is 1 to 11 degrees C. and mean annual frost-free days range from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 305 to 610 meters above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dannemora, Swancott (T), Fishcreek (T), Highmarket (T), Tughill, Westbury, and Worth soils. Swancott (T) and Fishcreek (T) are better drained and develop in outwash materials. Tughill soils are very poorly drained and lack a fragipan. Dannemora and Westbury soils are on lower positions on the landscape  and have redoximorphic features in the upper subsoil. Worth soils are well drained and lack redoximorphic features within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface. Highmarket (T) soils are well drained and lack a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is low to very high. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral soil is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low through moderately high in the fragipan and C horizons, but ranges to high in weakly formed fragipans and friable C horizons.  

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly forested. Minor logging operations and some areas of hayland or pasture may be present. Common forest species are northern red oak, eastern white pine, paper birch, American beech, eastern hemlock and sugar maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tughill Plateau, the Grit Plateau, and the northern fringe of the Adirondack Mountains of New York. MLRA's 140, 141, and 142. The series is moderately extensive.
