ELBUCK SERIES

The Elbuck series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Elbuck soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 635 mm.  The average annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Elbuck gravelly loam, woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 8 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse, common fine and very fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

     Bt1--8 to 36 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

     Bt2--36 to 114 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse and common medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2 is 66 to 142 cm)

     C--114 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse and very fine roots; few very fine pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba Area, New Mexico; 1990

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Argillic horizon: 8 to 115 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Particle-size control section:  8 to 58 cm (the Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)

These soils were formerly included with the Elbeth series. The Elbeth series has been redefined requiring an E horizon. 

Elbuck soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.
