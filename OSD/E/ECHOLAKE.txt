ECHOLAKE SERIES

The Echolake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale.  Echolake soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Echolake clay loam, on a south facing, simple, 5 percent slope in Ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,316 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on June 22, 1987 the soil was moist throughout.

    A1--0 to 3 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic, many fine and very fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--3 to 15 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist;  moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear irregular boundary.  (combined thickness of A1, A2 is 3 to 30 cm)

    Bt--15 to 66 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (38 to 64 cm thick)

    C--66 to 74 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent parachanners; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

    Cr--74 to 99 cm; weakly cemented shale bedrock.
