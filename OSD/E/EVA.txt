EVA SERIES

The Eva series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils formed sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are on very gently to strongly sloping dunes and plains of the Southern High Plains, northern part (MLRA 77A). Slope ranges from 1 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in).
