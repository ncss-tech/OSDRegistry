EZBIN SERIES

The Ezbin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in extrusive igneous rocks.  Ezbin soils are on mountains and have slopes of 4 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm. and the mean annual temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ezbin loam - on a 45 percent northeast-facing slope at 1,890 meters, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on November 7, 1979, the soil was frozen to 13 cm and moist throughout.) The surface is covered with 10 percent gravel and 3 percent stones.

       Oi--0 to 2 cm; slightly decomposed needles, twigs, leaves, and grass.  (1 to 3 cm thick)

       Oe--2 to 5 cm; moderately decomposed needles, twigs, leaves, and grass.  (1 to 5 cm thick)

       A--5 to 33 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 41 cm thick)

       Bt1--33 to 55 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  

       Bt2--55 to 81 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very stony clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  

       Bt3--81 to 132 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very stony  loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 81 to 127 cm) 

       BC--132 to 157 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely stony loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 30 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2).
