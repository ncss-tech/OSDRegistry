ERAM SERIES

The Eram series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils on interfluves and hillslopes. They formed from shale interbedded with thin layers of sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1045 mm (41 inches) and Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eram clay loam, 3 percent slope in rangeland on a backslope position, at an elevation of 236 meters (775 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [15 to 36 cm (6 to 14 inches) thick]

  Bt--25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay; moderate medium blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds; few fine faint light olive brown redoximorphic concentration masses; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [15 to 36 cm (6 to 14 inches) thick]

  BC--46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) clay; weak coarse blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; few fine faint gray redoximorphic depletion masses; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [15 to 41 cm (6 to 16 inches) thick]

  Cr--76 to 102 cm (30 to 40 inches); gray and olive shale; slightly acid in upper part becoming alkaline with depth.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dennis and the Garton series.  
Dennis and Garton soils have a solum more than 152 cm (60 inches) thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eram soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep ridges and sideslopes of hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. The soils formed in shales interbedded with thin layers of sandstone of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1200 mm (35 to 47 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 13 to 17 degrees C (55 to 63 degrees F). Frost-free period is 175 to 255 days. Elevation is 140 to 445 meters (460 to 1460 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices is 64 to 80.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Collinsville, Coweta, Dennis, Kenoma, Okemah, Talihina, Lebo and Woodson series.
Dennis, Kenoma, and Okemah soils occur on lower broad smooth slopes.
Talihina soils occur on higher ridge crests.
Collinsville and Coweta soils lack Bt horizons, have a solum less than 51 cm (20 inches) thick over sandstone bedrock, and occur on higher ridge crests.
Lebo soils occur on higher side slopes and are loamy-skeletal in the control section.
Woodson soils have an abrupt textural boundary between the A and Bt horizon and occur on lower broad smooth slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) during winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is high to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to high (0.42 - 14 micrometers per second) in the upper 81 cm (31 in) and very low to moderately high (.01 to 1.4 micrometers per second) in the lower 81 to 203 cm (31 to 80 in). 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range.  Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.  Some areas are cultivated to small grains, grain sorghums, soybeans, alfalfa, and tame pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 76, 84A, 112, 118B and 119) of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri.  The series is moderately extensive.
