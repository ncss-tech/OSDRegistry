EDGEWOOD SERIES

The Edgewood series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on creeps mantling cirques, dipslopes, scarpslopes and stratovolcanos.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rock or tephra.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Humic Udivitrands

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ryespur and Yawhee soils.  Ryespur soils have an argillic horizon, a xeric soil moisture regime and lack andic soil properties.  Yawhee soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - somewhat excessively
Permeability - moderately rapid

USE AND VEGETATION:  Edgewood soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The potential natural plant community is the white fir/snowbrush ceanothus-prostrate ceanothus/Virginia strawberry plant association.  Common overstory species include Douglas-fir, incense cedar, ponderosa pine, sugar pine and white fir.  Common understory species include greenleaf manzanita, creeping snowberry, snowbrush ceanothus, prostrate ceanothus and long-stolon sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features
Mollic epipedon - 2 to 19 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
Andic soil properties - 2 to 39 inches (A1, A2 and Bw1 horizons)
Cambic horizon - 19 to 61 inches (Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - 2 to 42 inches (A1, A2, Bw1 and portion of 2Bw2 horizons)
Need to check on amorphic vs. glassy, default is to go amorphic on udic soils
