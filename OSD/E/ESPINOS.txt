ESPINOS SERIES

The Espinos series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and slope alluvium over residuum derived from extrusive igneous rocks. Espinos soils are on beveled summits, shoulders, and backslopes of low hills. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Crosscan series. Crosscan soils do not have visible secondary calcium carbonate.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Espinos soils are on beveled summits, shoulders and backslopes of low hills. They formed in eolian material and slope alluvium over residuum derived from extrusive igneous Espinaso formation. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Khapo, Paraje, and Puertecito soils.  Khapo soils are coarse-loamy, are very deep, and are on summits of fan remnants.  Paraje soils are very deep and are on lower backslopes of hills.  Puertecito soils have argillic horizons and are on shoulders and backslopes of hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; permeability is moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Espinos soils are used for recreation, urban development, and watershed. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, New Mexico feathergrass, sideoats grama, twoneedle pinyon, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Gravelly(R036XB114NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Espinos soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
