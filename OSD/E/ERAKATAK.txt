The Erakatak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with surface mantles of volcanic ash. Erakatak soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.
