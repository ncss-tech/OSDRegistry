ERAKATAK SERIES

The Erakatak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with surface mantles of volcanic ash.  Erakatak soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section in winter and spring, dry late July through late October; xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 5 to 8 degrees C.

Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact.
Vitrandic intergrade properties: Occurs in horizons from the soil surface to at least 18 cm in depth within horizons having clay content of less than about 40 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Breeseranch, Dupratt, Finsel, Hamtah, Homecamp, Humarel, Lamulita, Maule, Menbo, Potlid, Shotsprings, Squatterflat and Wiltop series.

Breeseranch, Hamtah, Lamulita, Squatterflat and Wiltop soils are deeper than 100 cm.  Dupratt, Finsel and Menbo soils have mollic epipedons that are deeper than 50 cm thick. Humarel, Maule, Potlid and Shotsprings soils have an Oi horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Erakatak soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on summits or south-facing backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from volcanic rocks with surface mantles of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 80 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chen, Hackwood, and Tusel soils.  Chen soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Hackwood soils are fine-loamy, very deep, have thick mollic epipedons, and do not have argillic horizons.  Tusel soils are loamy-skeletal, have thick mollic epipedons, and are greater than 100 cm to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Erakatak soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, snowberry, cheatgrass, mountain brome, mule's ear wyethia, lupine, bottlebrush squirreltail, onion, and a minor amount of antelope bitterbrush and Thurber's needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada and south-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 23, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 10, 25, and 43C.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 16 cm (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 7 to 25 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 41 cm (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).
Lithic contact - The boundary at 25 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 7 to 25 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

The revision of July 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Argixerolls, moved the type location to a more representative area, and clarified the concept of the bedrock contact.
