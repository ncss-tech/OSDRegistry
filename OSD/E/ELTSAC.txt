ELTSAC SERIES

The Eltsac series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale. These soils are on uplands. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Leptic Udic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eltsac clay - cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Bw--6 to 14 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common intersecting slickensides; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    Bky--14 to 26 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common intersecting slickensides; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; common nests and seams of gypsum and few masses of segregated lime; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Cr--26 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) semiconsolidated shale; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

Elevation - 3,000 to 5,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 70 percent.
Parent material - semiconsolidated shale.
Climate - is cool, moist-semiarid, with long, cold, dry winters and warm moist springs and summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches, more than 70 percent of which falls in spring and early summer.
Mean annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 18 to 25 degrees F. and mean July temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 110 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Eltsac soils are used mainly as rangeland and for dryland crops.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass and green needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eltsac series are extensive throughout Montana.  MLRA 46, 53A, and 58A.
