EASTE SERIES

The Easte series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or andesite.  Easte soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Analulu, Blackprince, Blinn, Brevco, Daxty, Huntrock, Kamela, Lemoncreek, Redpeak, Santop, and Thout soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Ardenvoir and Warfield soils have ochric epipedons and are dry for less than 90 consecutive days. Ardtoo soils lack an umbric epipedon and are dry for less than 90 consecutive days. Coxit, Jimbluff, Jumpe, Lekrem, Minaloosa, Ontrail, and Seeburg soils are very deep.  Highhorn and Radercreek soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Longort soils are moderately deep to densic contacts.  Noil soils have rock fragments of schist, gneiss, or quartzite and have paralithic materials of metamorphic rocks in the series control section. Threecabin soils average less than 55 percent rock fragments in the particle-size contol section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Easte soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on north-facing footslope and backslope positions.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,830 to 2,320 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 730 mm occurring mostly as snowfall.  The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eaglelake, Outland, and Roop soils.  Eaglelake soils are fine-loamy and have argillic horizons.  Outland soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts and have argillic horizons.  Roop soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts and have lower base saturation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Easte soils are used for timber and Christmas tree production.  The vegetation is a forest canopy of white fir, red fir, and Western white pine with an understory of greenleaf manzanita, Sierra chinkapin, and ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern California and northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 21, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 22B and 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Washoe County (North Part), Nevada, 1995.  The series was proposed from the Susanville Area Soil Survey, California in 1988.  The type location is currently in this survey area.

REMARKS:  The revision of January 2004 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Humic Haploxerepts based on laboratory data and properties of associated soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 107 cm (A1, A2, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons).
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Paralithic contact - The boundary at 107 cm to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw1 horizon and parts of the A2 and Bw2 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled for characterization by UC Davis Soil Morphology Laboratory.  Organic carbon content is 8.8 percent in the A1 horizon, 3.7 percent in the A2 horizon, 1 percent in the Bw1 horizon, and 0.8 percent in the Bw2 horizon.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 49 percent in the A1 horizon, 31 percent in the A2 horizon, 49 percent in the Bw1 horizon, and 63 percent in the Bw2 horizon.  Ratios of 1500 kPa water to measured clay ranges from 6.1 in the A1 horizon to 2.0 in the Bw1 horizon.
