*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--zone from 3 to 60 cm

2010--Changed from previous classification of sandy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Dystroxerepts. Existing laboratory data does not reflect the presence of adequate quantities of volcanic glass to support the Vitrandic subgroup. Humic subgroup criteria is met using the twelfth edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
