ENTENTE SERIES

The Entente series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake terraces and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Lamellic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Entente silt loam, open stand of ponderosa pine. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; forest litter and partly decomposed conifer leaves and twigs.

    A--1 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable; common very fine, fine and many medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    E--4 to 9 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear irregular boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    E and Bt--9 to 13 inches; E part 85 percent, pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; Bt part 15 percent, lamellae 1/8 to 1 inch thick that are light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine, fine and few medium pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear broken boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    BC--13 to 29 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine and medium tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.

    C1--29 to 46 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; few fine and medium roots; common very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

    C2--46 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; few fine and medium roots; common very fine, fine and few medium tubular pores; weakly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the similar Ambrant, Wildgen and Winkler series in other families. Ambrant soils are coarse-loamy. Wildgen and Winkler soils are loamy-skeletal.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Entente soils are on lake terraces and stream terraces. Elevations are 3,500 to 4,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in silt loam deposits. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and early summers. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate to moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Entente soils are used mainly for forest products; small areas have been cleared for hayland or pasture. Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, western larch, and Douglas-fir dominating the overstory with Oregon-grape, rose, spiraea, serviceberry, snowberry, ninebark, kinnikinnick, balsamroot, strawberry, western yarrow, pussytoes, and tall grass in the understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Entente soils are inextensive in valleys in the Rocky Mountains in western Montana.
