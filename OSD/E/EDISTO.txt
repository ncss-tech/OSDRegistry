EDISTO SERIES

The Edisto series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils are besequal; typically they have very dark grayish brown loamy fine sand A horizons, light olive brown fine sandy loam B horizons, light brownish gray loamy fine sand A2 horizons, and mottled fine sandy loam B2t horizons.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Glossaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Edisto loamy fine sand--cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 10 inches; very dark grayish-brown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; few fine dark reddish-brown concretions; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick)

     E--10 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; few fine dark reddish-brown concretions; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

     Bt--14 to 19 inches; light olive-brown (2.5Y 5/4) fine sandy loam; common fine distinct yellowish-brown mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many fine and few medium root channels; strong brown staining around larger pores; sand grains coated with clay; common medium dark reddish-brown concretions; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

     A&B--19 to 27 inches; light brownish-gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand A material; common medium faint yellowish-brown (10YR 5/6) and many medium faint brown (10YR 5/3) mottles of fine sandy loam B material; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; many fine root channels stained with strong brown; few fine dark reddish-brown concretions; medium acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

     E'--27 to 36 inches; light brownish-gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand; common fine brown mottles; single grained; loose; few fine vesicular pores; brown-staining in pores; few fine irregularly shaped reddish-brown concretions; medium acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick)

     B't1--36 to 50 inches; mottled pale brown (10YR 6/3) yellowish-brown (10YR 5/6), and gray (10YR 6/1) fine sandy loam; moderate coarse and medium prismatic structure that parts into moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; brown portion is slightly brittle; few brown-stains in pores; thin patchy clay films on face of some peds; interfingering of A2 material that is 2 to 5 mm. thick between prisms; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 15 inches thick)

     B't2--50 to 62 inches; mottled light gray (10YR 7/1) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; brown portion is slightly brittle; thin patchy clay films on faces of some peds; thin streaks and pockets of clean sand grains; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick)

     B't3--62 to 70 inches; mottled brownish-yellow (10YR 6/8), light brownish-gray (2.5Y 6/2), strong brown (7.5YR 5/8), and light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; thin patchy clay films on faces of some peds; thin streaks and pockets of clean sand grains; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.   (6 to 10 inches thick)

     BC--70 to 84 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) fine sand; common fine distinct strong brown mottles; single grained; loose; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Charleston County, South Carolina, 1-1/2 miles southeast of Hollywood on north side of field road, 650 feet south of Seaboard Airline Railroad, and 950 feet west of County Road 79.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through medium acid, except for surface layers that has been limed.  Base saturation is more than 35 percent, generally less than 55 percent.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand; sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.

The E or E' horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand; sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.

The Bt or horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Few to common mottles mostly in shades of brown are in most pedons.  Some pedons have a few fine gray mottles.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.

The B't horizon is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and gray with hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

The BC horizon is mottled light gray to dark gray sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the family.  The Coteau, Farrenburg, Frizell, Longview, and Vidrine series are similar series in related families.  Coteau, Frizell, Longview, and Vidrine soils have by weight, less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material in the control section.  Farrenburg soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Edisto soils are on the Pamlico Terrace of the lower coastal plain.  They formed in thick sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 48 inches, and the freeze-free season is 294 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Meggett, Seabrook, Stono, and Wando series, none of which have bisequal.  In addition, Wando and Seabrook soils lack argillic horizons; Stono soils have mollic epipedons; and Meggett soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow surface runoff; moderate permeability.  The water table is 1 to 3 feet during the spring and winter months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils are in crops or pasture; the remainder is in loblolly pines.  Common crops are cabbage, potatoes, snap beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, soybeans, corn, and small grain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina, and possibly Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina.  The series is of moderate extent; more than 14,000 acres is in Charleston County, South Carolina.
