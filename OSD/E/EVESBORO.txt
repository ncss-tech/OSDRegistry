USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Most areas are in woodland, fruit and vegetable crops, or urban land. Most area in woodland has been repeatedly cut for wood products. Where irrigated, Evesboro soils are most commonly used for production of peaches, grapes, sweet potatoes, pumpkins and melons.
Dominant Vegetation: The wooded area is predominantly black oak, white oak, red oak, yellow poplar, and chestnut oak with scattered hickories, pitch pine, Virginia Pine, loblolly pine, and scrub and blackjack oaks. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Coastal Plain of New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland
Extent: Large

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pennsauken Creek Project, New Jersey, 1936 

REMARKS: The Evesboro series is the mesic equivalent of the Lakeland series. The Bw horizonation is based on color. This layer does not constitute a cambic horizon because the texture is not very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, or finer than these textures. Evesboro series have been reclassified from mesic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments to mesic, coated Lamellic Quartzipsamments. 
Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 cm (Oe, A1 and A2 horizons) 
Lamellic feature--Lamellae with total thickness of less than 15 cm (6 inches) in the series control section
