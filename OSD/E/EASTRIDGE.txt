EASTRIDGE SERIES

The Eastridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash influenced alluvium and/or colluvium derived from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes, hills and landslides.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy Vitrandic Haplocryalfs

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountain slopes, hills and landslides
Elevation - 1,560 to 2,380 meters
Slope - 8 to 75 percent 
Parent material - volcanic ash influenced alluvium and/or colluvium derived from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks
Climate - long, cold winters; cold, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 350 to 535 millimeters, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 5 degrees C.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Associated soils which occur on similar landforms are the Hungryhill, Germangulch and Evaro soil series.  Hungryhill and Germangulch soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Evaro soils are loamy-skeletal.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Eastridge soils are used mainly for timber production and understory grazing. Native vegetation is mainly an overstory of Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine with pinegrass, elk sedge, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, kinnikinnick, Oregon grape, woods pussytoes and common juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastridge soils are of small extent in the southwestern and central Montana. MLRA - 43B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Silver Bow County, Montana, 2007.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 28 cm (Oi, E1 and E2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - from 38 to 71 cm (Bt horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 38 to 71 cm (Bt horizon)

Eastridge soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

Additional Information: The E/Bt does not meet the color requirement for glossic albic material.
