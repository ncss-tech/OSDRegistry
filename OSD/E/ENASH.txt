ENASH SERIES

The Enash series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from tuff.  These moderate sloping soils are on mountain bases.  Slope ranges from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Enash very gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

        A--0 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) crushed, very gravelly loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) crushed, moist; 16 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots throughout; 50 percent flat rounded tuff gravel; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 6.6, gradual smooth boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

        C2--14 to 21 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) crushed, very gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) crushed, moist; 24 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 40 percent flat rounded tuff gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid, gradual smooth boundary (5 to 10 inches thick).

        C3--21 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) crushed, very gravelly loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) crushed, moist; 22 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 35 percent flat rounded tuff gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid, pH 6.5; diffuse smooth boundary (5 to 15 inches thick).

        C4--35 to 50 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) crushed, gravelly loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) crushed, moist; 22 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 30 percent flat rounded tuff gravel; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 6.8; gradual smooth boundary (10 to 30 inches thick).

        C5--50 to 80 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) crushed, very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) crushed, moist; 20 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky and moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few fine roots throughout; 50 percent flat rounded tuff gravel; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 7.0.

TYPE LOCATION: Dona Ana County, New Mexico; approximately 5.3 miles west and 5.5 miles south of White Sands; 1,980 feet north and 1,760 feet east of the southwest corner of  sec. 19, T. 23 S., R. 4 E..  USGS Organ Peak topographic quadrangle; latitude 32 degrees 17 minutes 32.58 seconds north and longitude 106 degrees 34 minutes 11.07 seconds west.  UTM zone 13S, 352190E, 3573738N, NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: The moisture control section is usually dry in some or in all parts for six-tenths or more of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Some part of the epipedon is moist for more than 90 cumulative days in most years when the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature:  59 to 62 degrees F.

Thickness of mollic epipedon:  30 to 56 inches

Rock fragment content: 35 to 60 percent

Clay content: 18 to 27 percent

Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

A horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 3 or 5 dry, 2.5 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3, dry or moist
Rock fragments: tuff fragments; 35 to 65 percent gravel size fragments

C horizons
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2.5 to 4 moist
Chroma: 1 to 5, dry or moist
Texture modifier: gravelly or very gravelly
Rock fragments: tuff fragments; 25 to 60 percent gravel size fragments
Texture: loam, clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Sanmoss (TX) and Santo Tomas (NM) series. The Sanmoss soils have a mollic epipedon less than 30 inches thick, are effervescent, and have secondary calcium carbonate from 12 to 40 inches. The Santo Tomas soils are in the ustic aridic moisture regime in the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium and colluvium derived from tuff
Landform:  mountain bases
Slope:  1 to 8 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 58 to 66 degrees
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.
Additional moisture is received as a result of runoff from adjacent mountain flanks
Frost-free period: 140 to 220 days
Elevation: 3,800 to 6,200 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Silktassel, Thaad, and Crotalus soils.
Silktassel soils are shallow to bedrock and are on mountain tops and flanks.
Thaad soils have argillic horizons and occur on higher positions.
Crotalus soils have calcic horizons and are on mountain flanks and bases.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is medium on slopes of 3 to 5 percent and high on slopes of 5 to 8 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is of the mixed prairie type consisting of hairy grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, oak spp., and alligator juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico; LRR-D, MLRA 42.  The series is of minor extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dona Ana County, New Mexico; 2001

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches (C1, C2, C3 and C4 horizons)

Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 50 inches (A, C1, C2, C3 and C4)

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Soils classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
