ELLOREE SERIES

The Elloree series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments.  These soils have sandy A and E horizons, and loamy Bt horizons.  They are on flood plains of streams in the Coastal plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Arenic Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Elloree loamy fine sand on a narrow flood plain under mixed hardwood and pine at an elevation of about 110 feet. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     A--0 to 6 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loamy fine sand; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine, medium, and large roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

     E--6 to 23 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand; common coarse uncoated sand grains; few strong brown coarse sand grains; single grained; very friable; few fine and medium roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (14 to 30 inches thick)

     Btgl--23 to 27 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam; few fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) accumulations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots along faces of peds; very few faint clay films on faces of peds; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

     Btg2--27 to 42 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) sandy loam; few fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) accumulations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots along faces of peds; few coarse strong brown sand grains; few faint clay films on faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 15 to 30 inches)

     BCgl--42 to 53 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) loamy sand; many coarse distinct light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) pockets of sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

     BCg2--53 to 69 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sandy loam; common fine distinct yellow (2.5Y 7/8) soft masses of iron accumulation; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the BCg horizon is 0 to 35 inches)

     Cg--69 to 80 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sandy loam; few fine distinct olive yellow (2.5Y 7/8) soft masses of iron accumulation; massive; firm; mildly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Orangeburg County, South Carolina; 7.5 miles north of Holly Hill; 1.4 miles northeast of the junction of U.S. Highway 15 and secondary road 202; 0.3 mile south on unpaved road; 350 feet west of road, and 50 feet north of ditch.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 40 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, strongly acid to neutral in the E horizon, and strongly acid to moderately alkaline throughout the rest of the profile.  Some pedons have a few calcium carbonate concretions in the lower part of the profile.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.

The E horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.

The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of brown or yellow are in some pedons.  It dominantly is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but ranges to sandy clay loam.

The BCg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.

The Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons may range to a hue of 5GY.  It is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  (This section not updated this date; 6/16/97) This is the Goldhead series on broad areas of the flatwoods and in depressions.  (See Remarks.)  Similar soils are the Bibb, Felda, Muchalee, Osier, Wadmalaw, and Yonges series.  Bibb, Muchalee, and Osier soils are stratified at some depth.  In addition, Bibb and Osier soils are acid.  Wadmalaw and Yonges soils have mixed mineralogy.[

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bibb, Muchalee, Wadmalaw, and Yonges series plus the Goldsboro, Lynchburg, Ocilla, and Rains series.  Goldsboro, Lynchburg and Ocilla soils are better drained.  Rains soils are Ultisols and have A and E horizons less than 20 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elloree soils are on flood plains of the Coastal Plain.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 66 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 230 to 260 days.  The soil is subject to flooding, usually during winter and early spring.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained, slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are native forest consisting mainly of sweet gum, red maple, southern bayberry, black cherry, and loblolly pine.  Understory species include Dwarf palmetto, greenbrier, and chainfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Middle and lower Coastal Plain of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina.  The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Orangeburg County, South Carolina; 1985.

REMARKS:  Distinction between the Goldhead and Elloree series is not clear and needs further study.

Particle size data, mineralogy and base saturation data are available on several pedons.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon and arenic feature - the zone from the surface of the soil to 23 inches (A and E horizons)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 42 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)

Aqualfs feature - dominant chroma of 2 or less in the matrix of the argillic horizon with mottles of higher chroma
