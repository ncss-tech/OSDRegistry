ESTES SERIES

The Estes series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils.  These nearly level floodplain soils formed in acid clayey and loamy alluvium in the Coastal Plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F); mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for woodland and/or wildlife.  A few areas are used for improved pastures of bahiagrass, fescue or dallisgrass.  Native vegetation consists of a mixed hardwood forest.  The major commercial trees are water oak, willow oak and sweetgum.  Other vegetation includes a few scattered green ash, elm, hackberry, mulberry, hickory, pecan and widely scattered native pine with an understory of grasses and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Texas and western Louisiana,; Land Resource Region (P); MLRA 133B and some MLRA 150; the series is of large extent.
