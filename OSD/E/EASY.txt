EASY SERIES

The Easy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial drift on debris aprons, valley walls, Pleistocene moraines and bedrock benches.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic, frigid Andic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Easy ashy sandy loam, on a bedrock bench landform with a NE facing slope of 10 percent at 915 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation.  When described on August 27, 2005 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Easy soils are on debris aprons, valley walls, Pleistocene moraines and bedrock benches at elevations of 400 to 1,100 meters.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and glacial drift over glacial drift.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,500 to 2,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 8 degrees C. Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cosho (T), Ledeir (T) and Thorton (T) soils.  Cosho soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and lack spodic horizons. Ledeir soils form on more active areas of each landform and are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Thorton soils are found on slightly more unstable portions of each landform and lack spodic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation consists of western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and minor amounts of grand fir with an understory of red huckleberry, Alaska huckleberry, rattlesnake plantain, vine maple, Oregon-grape and sword fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of moderate extent.
