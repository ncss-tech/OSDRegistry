EVANOT SERIES

The Evanot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Evanot soils are on hills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Evanot loam , on a east facing,  4 percent slope in dry cropland at an elevation of 6,380 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 3, 1977 the soil was moist from 0 to 20 inches and dry below.

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 20 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds ; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.

    Bk3--42 to 51 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine tubular pores; calcium carbonate disseminated and as few fine soft seams and threads on faces of peds ; ; violently effervescent; 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  

    Bk4--51 to 65 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; calcium carbonate disseminated and as few fine soft seams and threads on faces of peds ; strongly effervescent; 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).  (The combined thickness of the Bk horizons ranges from 30 to 40 inches )
