ELCAJON SERIES

The Elcajon series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy loam or loam till underlain by karst limestone on ground moraines and glacial lake benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Aquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Elcajon very fine sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 229 meters (750 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches) thick]

 Bt--30 to 74 cm (12 to 29 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and medium roots; common fine vesicular pores; common distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds; many coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; few fine faint brown (7.5YR 4/2) iron depletions; about 8 percent angular gravel and 6 percent subangular gravel; about 1 percent subangular cobbles; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [10 to 51 cm (4 to 20 inches) thick]

 Cr--74 to 94 cm (29 to 37 inches); bluish gray (5B 5/1) very flaggy loam; very few very fine and fine roots; 50 percent flagstones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

 R--94 to 104 cm (37 to 41 inches); fractured karst limestone; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

Residuum weathered from bedrock, as much as 10 cm (4 inches) thick, is in some pedons. The bedrock consists of limestone that has widely spaced joints that extend to depths varying from a few inches to several feet. Some of these cracks are partially filled with loamy soil.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crossett, Peshtigo, and Slade series. Crossett, Peshtigo, and Slade soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elcajon soils are on concave or plane slopes and depressions on ground moraines and glacial lake benches underlain by karst limestone. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The Elcajon soils formed in sandy loam or loam till 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick over karst limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 100 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chippeny, Lachine, Namur, and Summerville soils. Chippeny soils are very poorly drained and are in depressions. Lachine soils are on the same position but occur in areas where the depth to bedrock is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches). The excessively drained Namur soils occur in areas where the depth to bedrock is less than 25 cm (10 inches). The well drained Summerville soils occur in areas where the depth to bedrock is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the fractured limestone. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and very rapid in the fractured limestone.

USE AND VEGETATION: Much of this soil in association with well drained areas has been cleared and is used for general farming. Native vegetation is commonly mixed trees consisting mainly of sugar maple, balsam fir and American basswood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94C in the northeastern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
