EDGINGTON SERIES

The Edgington series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly to slowly permeable soils on nearly level or depressional upland positions.  They formed in loess.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Argiaquic Argialbolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corley, Ebbert, Knight, Marissa, Normal, Speed, Thorp and Vesser series. Corley soils have part of the mollic epipedon below the albic horizon.  Ebbert, Marissa and Normal soils are less than 61 cm (24 inches) to the top of the argillic horizon.  Knight and Thorp soils contain more than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Speed soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F) in the soil temperature control section.  Vesser soils have albic horizons more than 31 cm (12 inches) thick. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edgington soils are in depressions and on nearly level parts of loess-covered till plains, driftless areas, and stream terraces. Slope gradients are commonly 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 12.2 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 to 1143 mm (34 to 45 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are most commonly the somewhat poorly drained Muscatune and Ipava soils, the moderately well drained Osco soils, and the well drained Tama soils. Other associates are the somewhat poorly drained Joy soils and moderately well drained Port Byron soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or low.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low (0.42 to 4.23 micrometer per second). Permeability is moderately slow or slow. The seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 31 cm (1 foot) below the surface during spring in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Largely under cultivation to corn, soybeans, small grains, and grass-legume meadows. Native vegetation is probably water-loving sedges and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central to northwestern Illinois in MLRAs 95B, 105, 108A, 108B, and 115C.  The extent is small.
