EVERRY SERIES

The Everry series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium from calcareous siltstone on hills.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Everry soils have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Everry loam, in rangeland, at 6,390 feet elevation.  When described on September 4, 1995, the soil was slightly moist throughout.  (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent (21 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--4 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common discontinuous distinct clay films in pores and on faces of peds; strongly effervescent (23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--10 to 15 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and irregular pores; common patchy faint clay films in pores and on faces of peds; strongly effervescent (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 8 to 16 inches.)

    C1--15 to 28 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly silt loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; violently effervescent (40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 40 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary.

    C2--28 to 43 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) very gravelly silt loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); 50 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of C horizons is 18 to 34 inches.)

    Cr--43 inches; highly fractured calcareous siltstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Bear Lake County, Idaho; about 0.5 miles southwest of Border Summit; about 1,800 feet south and 2,800 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 18, T.14S., R.46E.  Latitude - 42 degrees, 12 minutes, 28 seconds north; Longitude - 111 degrees, 7 minutes, 15 seconds west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Profile:
Depth to argillic horizon - 2 to 6 inches.
Depth to base of argillic horizon - 10 to 22 inches.
Depth to paralithic contact - 40 to 60 inches.
Average annual soil temperature - 43 to 45 degrees F.

Particle-size control section:
Clay content range - 27 to 34 percent (total clay).
Rock fragment content - 5 to 30 percent.
Calcium carbonate equivalent - 15 to 40 percent (less than 2mm plus rock fragments less than 20mm).
Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline.

A horizon:
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 moist
Clay content - 18 to 24 percent

Bt horizons:
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 4 or 5 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Texture - clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam
Clay content - 27 to 34 percent

C horizons:
Hue - 2.5Y or 5Y
Value - 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture - very gravelly silt loam or very gravelly loam
Clay content - 20 to 26 percent
Rock fragment content - 35 to 50 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Delleker and Lyonsville series.  Delleker soils have slightly acid or moderately acid reaction throughout.  Lyonsville soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Everry soils are on hills at elevations of 6,000 to 7,450 feet.  They are generally on concave or north facing slopes.  They formed in residuum and alluvium from calcareous siltstone.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Preuss (T), Mumford (T), and Sprollow (T) soils.  Preuss soils are generally on south facing, smooth to convex slopes and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Mumford soils are on ridges and convex slopes and are 10 to 20 inches deep.  Sprollow soils are on smooth to convex sloping limestone hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Everry soils are used for rangeland.  The potential natural vegetation is Alkali sagebrush and Bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  This series is not extensive.
