ELMER SERIES 


The Elmer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in stratified calcareous loamy alluvium. These soils are on terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters), and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Darlow and Punkin soils. The somewhat poorly drained Darlow soils do not have a mollic epipedon and the depth to the natric horizon is less than 15 inches (38 centimeters). The somewhat poorly drained Punkin soils have a fine particle size control section and are less than 15 inches (38 centimeters) to the natric horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is slow or very slow. Permeability is slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Almost all areas are used for cropland. Wheat, grain sorghum and alfalfa are the primary crops. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. The Elmer series is of small extent.
