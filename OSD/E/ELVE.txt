ELVE SERIES 

The Elve series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or till derived from igneous rocks. These soils are on mountain slopes, hills, moraines, or alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 85 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Elve very cobbly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 1 inch; forest litter of moderately decomposed needles, twigs, and cones. (1 to 2 inches thick) 

    A--1 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 30 percent angular gravel, 25 percent angular cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 9 inches thick) 

    E--3 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 25 percent angular gravel, 30 percent angular cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.5); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 25 inches thick) 

    Bw1--18 to 34 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 30 percent angular gravel, 35 percent angular cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bw2--34 to 47 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) extremely cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 30 percent angular gravel, 35 percent angular cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 20 inches thick) 

    BC--47 to 60 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) extremely cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 40 percent angular gravel, 45 percent angular cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Elve soils are used mainly for forest products, watershed, and recreation.  Potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine with a sparse understory of kinnikinnick, white spiraea, Oregon-grape, common juniper, and grouse whortleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Elve soils are of limited extent in the mountains of central and southwestern Montana, and Colorado. MLRAs - 43B, 44B, 46.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fergus County, Montana, 1979. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 8 inches (Oe, A, part of E horizons)
Cambic horizon - from 18 to 47 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 11 to 41 inches (part of E, Bw1, part of Bw2 horizons)

Elve soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on udic. 

Additional Information: The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
