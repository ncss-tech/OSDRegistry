EASPUR SERIES

The Easpur series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Holocene age. These soils are on flood plains of small streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Fluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Easpur loam-cultivated, at an elevation of 259 m (850 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(Thickness of the C horizon is 0 to 84 cm [0 to 33 in])

    2Ab--104 to 157 cm (41 to 62 in); dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, firm; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Ab horizon is 25 to 53 cm [10 to 21 in])

    2Bwb--157 to 183 cm (62 to 72 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pursley and Spur series in the same family.  Soils in similar families in MLRA 80A are Asher, Ashport, Keokuk, and Pocasset series.
Asher soils: have a fine-silty control section and have secondary carbonates within 102 cm (40 in)
Ashport soils: have a fine-silty control section
Keokuk soils: have a coarse-silty control section
Pocasset soils: have a coarse-loamy control section
Pursley soils: are in a warmer climate, and have subsoil hues of 10YR or yellower
Spur soils: are dry for longer periods and have secondary carbonates within 102 cm (40 in)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in loamy alluvium of Holocene age
Landscape: alluvial plain
Landform: flood plains of small streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies 
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean Annual Precipitation: 838 to 991 mm (33 to 39 in)
Mean Annual Temperature: 15 to 17.2 degrees C (59 to 63 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 181 to 240 days
Elevation: 229 to 305 m (750 to 1000 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Port, Dale, and Pulaski series.
Dale soils: are on slightly higher positions, are rarely flooded, and have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm (20 in) thick and have a fine-silty control section
Port soils: are on similar positions, have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm (20 in) thick, and have a fine-silty control section
Pulaski soils: are typically closer to the stream channel, have a coarse-loamy control section, and do not have a mollic epipedon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: Well drained
Permeability: moderate
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: Moderately high
Runoff: Negligible
Flooding: Occasionally flooded for very brief to brief periods during March to October

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are mainly cultivated.  Alfalfa, small grains, and grain sorghum are the principal crops.  Some areas are used for improved pasture or rangeland.  Native vegetation is tall grasses with an overstory of pecan, black walnut, bur oak, and Eastern cottonwood trees.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Oklahoma; LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A); these soils are not extensive.
