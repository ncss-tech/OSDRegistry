ELKSEL SERIES



The Elksel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in

colluvium and residuum from andesite, latite, and basalt.  Elksel soils

are on mountain sides and have slopes of 30 to 60 percent.

Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14

inches, and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Ultic Argixerolls

Argixerolls.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Elksel very cobbly loam on a 40 percent southwest

facing slope at an elevation of 5,650 feet in rangeland.  When

described, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil

unless otherwise noted).



    A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly loam, very

dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure;

soft, very friable; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very

fine interstitial pores; about 25 percent cobbles and 10 percent

pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)



    A2--3 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly loam,

dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft,

friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine,

and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; about 35 percent

cobbles and 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

(5 to 8 inches thick)



    AB--10 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly clay

loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine

roots; many very fine interstitial pores; about 40 percent cobbles and

10 percent pebbles; few thin clay films in pores, neutral (pH 6.8);

abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)



    Bt1--13 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay, dark

yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky

structure, very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very

fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; about 45 percent cobbles and

10 percent pebbles; common moderately thick clay films in pores;

neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)



    Bt2--17 to 33 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly

clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist, strong fine angular blocky

structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very

fine tubular pores; about 60 percent cobbles and 10 percent pebbles;

many thick clay films in pores; neutral (pH 7.2) gradual irregular

boundary.  (10 to 18 inches thick)



    Bt3--33 to 45 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly

sandy clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong fine angular

blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic;

few very fine tubular pores; about 60 percent cobbles and 15 percent

pebbles; many thick clay films in pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual

irregular boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)



    R--45 inches; fractured andesite bedrock with Bt3 material in

cracks 1 to 4 mm wide; few very fine roots in cracks.

north of Carey; 800 feet west and 100 feet south of the northeast

corner of section 35, T. 1N R. 21 E.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cavanaugh and Howcree series.

Cavanaugh soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Howcree soils have

silica cementation above 40 inches and lack cobbles in the argillic.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elksel soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range

from 30 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 7,500 feet.  The

soil formed in colluvium and residuum from andesite, latite, and basalt

bedrock.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, most of

which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual

temperature is about 40 degrees to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season

is 60 to 90 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Starhope, Friedman,

Mulshoe, Winridge, and Winu soils.  Starhope and Mulshoe soils have

bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Friedman, Winridge, and Winu

soils have an average summer soil temperature less than 59 degrees F

and are on north-facing and east-facing slopes.  Starhope and Mulshoe

soils are on south and west-facing slopes.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to very

rapid.  Permeability is slow.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is Mountain

big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, bitterbrush, bluebunch

wheatgrass, Basin wildrye, Nevada bluegrass and needlegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho.  These soils are

inextensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series

are:



Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to

approximately 13 inches (A1, A2, and AB horizons).



Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 13 to 33 inches (Bt1 and

Bt2 horizons).



Percent clay is greater than 35 and percent rock fragments in this

horizon is also greater than 45.
