ENVOL SERIES

The Envol series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from welded tuff. The Envol soils are on side slopes of foothills and mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Envol gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 50 percent gravel and 5 percent with cobbles.

    A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and few medium vesicular pores; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

    Btk1--8 to 18 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; few thin lime coats on undersides of rock fragments; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Btk2--18 to 25 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) gravelly clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds; common thin lime coats on undersides of rock fragments; 30 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

    R--25 cm; welded tuff with the upper 3 to 5 cm consisting of weathered tuff.

TYPE LOCATION: Pershing County, Nevada; approximately 4.7 miles southwest of Toulon, about 1,900 feet east and 300 feet north of the southwest corner of section 9, T. 25 N., R. 29 E.; latitude 40 degrees 2 minutes 38.2 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees, 43 minutes, 55.5 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.0439444 latitude, -118.732083 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in winter and spring, dry late May through November; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to lithic contact: 13 to 36 cm.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.
Other features: A high degree of geologic banding is present resulting in a wide range of hue reflecting lithochromic colors.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent.
Sand: Contain less than 45 percent sand.
Rock fragments: Averages 10 to 35 percent, mostly gravel.

A horizon
Hue: 5YR, 5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.

Btk horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Texture: Clay, gravelly clay or gravelly clay loam.
Clay content: 30 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments: 10 to 35 percent, mainly gravel.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bojo, Hoskinnini and Kimnoli series. 

Bojo soils lack argillic horizons with segregated lime and have mean annual soil temperatures of 8 to 11 degrees C. Hoskinnini soils have Bt horizons with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and an argillic horizon that does not extend to the lithic contact. Kimnoli soils have o to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Envol soils are on mountain and foothill side slopes. These soils formed in residuum derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,250 to 1,770 meters. The climate is cool, arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biga, Dorper, and Granshaw soils. Biga, Dorper and Granshaw soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; rapid or very rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, Bailey greasewood, bud sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, Indian ricegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Nevada. MLRA 27.  These soils are not extensive.
