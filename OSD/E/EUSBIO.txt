EUSBIO SERIES

The Eusbio series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or residuum from old lacustrine sediments.  Eusbio soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eusbio silt loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 7 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure that parts to moderate very fine granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    BA--7 to 14 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, black (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine angular blocks; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt1--14 to 20 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt2--20 to 24 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Cr--24 to 36 inches; white (5Y 8/1) silt stone, light gray (5Y 7/2) moist; strong medium and thick laminated; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; root mat on the contact; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Gooding County, Idaho, 15 miles north and 1.5 miles east of Bliss in the southeast 1/4 of southeast 1/4, sec. 28, T. 3 S., R. 13. E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Value, moist - 2 to 4
Chroma, moist or dry - 1 to 3

Clay content - 20 to 35 percent

Cr horizon
Calcium carbonate content - 3 to 15 percent
Depth - 20 to 33 inches

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abgese, Greenbrae, Lankbush, Morfitt, Paulville, Sevy, Turria, Wenatchee and Zane.  Abgese, Greenbrae, Lank- bush, Morfitt, Paulville, Sevy, Turria, and Wenatchee soils lack a paralithic contact.  Lankbush soils are noncalcareous above a depth of 40 inches and have a solum 30 to 50 inches thick.  Morfitt soils lack lime above depth of 40 inches.  Sevy soils have a calcic Horizon at 16 to 34 inches.  Wenatchee soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick.  Zane soils have 5YR and 7.5YR hues in the Bt horizon and lack a paralithic contact above 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eusbio soils are on nearly level to very steep alluvial fans or terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,300.  The soil is formed from consolidated silt stone or tuff of the Payette or related Tertiary formation.  In places there may be a minor admixture of loessial material in the surface horizon.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers and annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 90 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilcott, Karcal, Lanktree and Yutrue.  The Chilcott soils have more than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Lanktree has more than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon and is deeper than 40 inches.  Karcal and Yutrue soils have clay textures to the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for range.  Vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bitterbrush, cheatgrass, rattlesnake brome and lupine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern and southcentral Idaho.  This series is inextensive.
