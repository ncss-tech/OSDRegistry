ESCALANTE SERIES

The Escalante series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. Escalante soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains, inset fans, fan aprons, fan skirts, and fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Crestline soils have cambic horizons and the particle-size control section averages gravelly sandy loam. 
Declo soils are dominantly loam, silt loam, and very fine sandy loam in the particle-size control section and do not receive intermittent summer precipitation that affects the moisture control section.
Eoyote soils do not receive intermittent summer precipitation that affects the moisture control section.
Kecko soils have cambic horizons and are not effervescent above 52 cm.
Sagehill soils have cambic horizons, are stratified in the lower part of the Bk horizon, and contain 2 to 8 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Somsen soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.
Strevell soils are moderately deep to a lithologic discontinuity with loamy-skeletal horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks
Landform: Alluvial flats, lake plains, inset fans, fan aprons, fan skirts, and fan remnants
Slopes: 0 to 15 percent
Elevation: 700 to 2,140 meters
Mean annual temperature: 7 to 11 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: 200 to 360 mm
Climate: The climate is semiarid-continental with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers with brief periods of summer convection storms in late summer.
Frost-free period: 100 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Antelope Springs, Beryl, Heist, Taylorsflat, and Uvada soils. Antelope Springs and Uvada soils have natric horizons. Antelope Springs soils have more than 18 percent clay and Uvada soils have more than 35 percent clay in their natric horizons and occur at slightly lower positions on the landscape. Beryl soils do not have calcic horizons and have some silica cementation. Heist soils do not have calcic horizons and are gravelly in the particle-size control section. Taylorsflat soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section. Beryl, Heist, and Taylorsflat soils are intermixed with the Escalante soils on the landscape. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low to medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Escalante soils are used mainly for livestock grazing, but small areas are cultivated. Present vegetation is Douglas rabbitbrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, broom snakeweed, Indian ricegrass, sand dropseed, and bottlebrush squirreltail. These soils are correlated to Semidesert ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Utah and Southern Idaho. This series is extensive. MLRAs 11, 25, 28A. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iron County (Beryl-Enterprise Survey Area), Utah, 1942. 

REMARKS:
Areas mapped in the MLRA 11 and 25 areas may not the have brief periods of moisture during the late summer due to convection storms which is characteristic of the series. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to 18 cm. (A horizon and part of the BA horizon)
Calcic horizon - The zone from 28 to 84 cm. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm. (Bk1, Bk2, and parts of the BA and Bk3 horizons)
