EDGWAY SERIES

The Edgway series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foothills and mountains. These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from mixed sources.  Edgway soils have moderately slow permeability.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Huckridge, Koffgo, Povey and Tophat series. Huckridge soils formed in local alluvium derived from loess and volcanic ash on nearby summits.  They have an ochric epipedon greater than 24 inches thick and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser particles throughout the solum.  Koffgo, Povey and Tophat soils are on nearby foothills and mountains.  Koffgo soils have an ochric epipedon and lack an argillic horizon.  Povey soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches thick and lack an argillic horizon.  Tophat soils average greater than 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent rock
fragments in the particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained,  high or very high runoff,  moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Edgway soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, timber production and wildlife habitat.  These soils commonly support forested communities dominated by Douglas-fir, subalpine fir or quaking aspen.  The potential natural communities are the Douglas-fir/pinegrass plant association and the subalpine fir/sweetcicely plant association.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  They are of moderate extent.
