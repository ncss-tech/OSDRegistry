EAGLETON SERIES

The Eagleton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eagleton loam, in grass hay (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; strong medium and coarse granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium roots; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--6 to 19 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam consisting of thin layers of fine sandy loam and clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; common fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    A3--19 to 38 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam consisting of thin layers of fine sandy loam and clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; common fine and medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (14 to 24 inches thick)

    Cg--38 to 60 inches; black (5Y 2.5/1) loam consisting of thin layers of fine sandy loam and silty clay loam, dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0).
