GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alterationcreek, Benitocreek, Chitina, Hanagita, Ironcreek, and Rocklake soils.
Alterationcreek have bedrock below 100 cm (39 in) and occur on hillslopes and mountain valleys.
Benitocreek soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a lithic contact within 2 meters of the surface, and occur on mountain slopes and glacial valley floors.
Chitina soils have very deep (>40 cm, >16 in) mollic epipedons, and occur on loess covered lacustrine and stream terraces.
Hanagita soils are moderately deep to bedrock, form in loess and till covered bedrock, and occur on foothills and mountain slopes.
Ironcreek soils lack a cambic horizon and occur in river valleys and flood plains
Rocklake soils are shallow to bedrock and occur on ridge lines and escarpments.
