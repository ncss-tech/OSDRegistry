EELCOVE SERIES

The Eelcove series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in fine alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Eelcove soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 235 millimeters (9 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (62.5 degrees F.).
