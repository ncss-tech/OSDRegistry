EASTWELL SERIES

The Eastwell series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Eastwell soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; near the south end of Antelope Valley, west of Ravenswood, and about 0.9 mile west of the Red Bird Mine; 1,000 feet west and 2,500 feet north of the southeast corner of section 24, T. 22 N., R. 41 E.; USGS Gilbert Creek SE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 45 minutes 36 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 18 minutes 33 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.7600000 latitude, -117.3091667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry June to October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 25 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 27 percent.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Effervescence: Noneffervescent through slightly effervescent.

Bw horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam; some pedons have thin subhorizons with less than 35 percent gravel.
Structure:  Weak or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky.
Effervescence:  Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.
Salinity (EC): 0 to 2 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): commonly 13 to 30, some pedons are 0 to 5.
Other features: In some pedons this horizon is 15 or 18 cm thick and qualifies as a cambic horizon.

Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loam.

Cementation: Some pedons are extremely weakly through strongly cemented in a discontinuous manner by secondary silica and/or calcium carbonate.
Effervescence:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Salinity (EC): 0 to 2 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): commonly 13 to 30, some pedons are 0 to 5.

Identifiable secondary carbonates:  Commonly occurs as coats on bottoms of rock fragments.

Bqkm horizon

Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Cementation class:  Strongly cemented, some pedons lack thin discontinuous silica laminae.
Structure:  Platy or massive.
Consistence:  Very hard or extremely hard dry, very firm or extremely firm moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Molion series.  Molion soils have 50 to 70 percent gravel and 2 or 3 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eastwell soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some amount of loess.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackhawk and Chiara soils.  Blackhawk soils are loamy, have cambic horizons, and are in a typic aridic moisture regime.  Chiara soils are loamy and are shallow to indurated duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Eastwell soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.  Some areas have widely-spaced singleleaf pinyon and Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs 24 and 28B.
