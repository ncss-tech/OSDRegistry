ENOCHLAKE SERIES

The Enochlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope wash derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  The Enochlake soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal over loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Enochlake soils.
Parent material: Slope wash derived from sandstone.
Landform: Mountain side slopes.
Slopes: 3 to 65 percent
Elevation: 8500 to 9800 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 43 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 18 to 22 inches with generally uniform distribution throughout the year.
Frost-free period: 50 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Yeljack and Dreamscape series.  Yeljack soils are fine-loamy.  Dreamscape soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as native pastureland, for recreational purposes, and have a limited value for forestry.  Native vegetation is mainly a widely spaced cover of fir or aspen with an understory of Thurber fescue, columbine, lupine, and peavine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Enochlake soils occur in western Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED/ESTABLISHED:  Mesa county, Colorado. Mesa County Soil Survey Area.  The name is coined from a nearby landmark.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
If the particle size class existed this series would classify as sandy or sandy-skeletal over clayey.
