EMMET SERIES

The Emmet series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils formed in sandy loam till on end moraines, drumlins, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Inceptic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Emmet sandy loam, on a northeast-facing, 4 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 E--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) sandy loam; weak medium platy structure; friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 Bw--30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; about 1 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 41 cm (16 inches) thick]

 E'--61 to 76 cm (24 to 30 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [(0 to 38 cm (15 inches) thick]

 Bt--76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam; thick coatings of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extend from E' horizon on vertical faces of peds; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay films on some peds and in pores; about 2 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [15 to 36 cm (6 to 14 inches) thick]

 C--96 to 152 cm (38 to 60 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky fragments; very friable; 3 percent gravel and 3 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Emmet County, Michigan; about 2 miles southwest of Petoskey; 2,320 feet east and 100 feet north of southwest corner of sec. 11, T. 34 N., R. 6 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: typically 76 to 102 cm (30 to 40 inches) but ranges from 61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches)
Depth to carbonates: typically 76 to 102 cm (30 to 40 inches) but ranges from 61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches)
Rock fragment content: 2 to 25 percent gravel in the solum and 5 to 25 percent gravel in the substratum; 0 to 20 percent cobbles in the surface layer and 0 to 10 percent cobbles in the rest of the pedon; stone content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout

Some pedons have BC horizons.

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam; lenses of loam, loamy sand, sand, or gravel are in some pedons

In some areas the C horizon is firm, dense till.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Emmet soils are on end moraines, drumlins, and ground moraines of Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Emmet soils formed in sandy loam till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Charlevoix, Ensley, Leelanau, Omena, and Onaway soils. The somewhat poorly drained Charlevoix soils and the poorly drained Ensley soils are in the same drainage sequence. Leelanau, Omena, and Onaway soils are well drained associates and are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained or moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low to high depending upon slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part of the less sloping areas are cropped. Corn, hay, oats, and wheat are the principal crops. Apple and cherry orchards are in favorable air drainage locations. A large part of the steeper areas is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is dominantly quaking aspen, American basswood, American beech, eastern hemlock, northern red oak, red pine, and sugar maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, 96, and 98 in the northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northeastern Wisconsin. This series is of large extent.
