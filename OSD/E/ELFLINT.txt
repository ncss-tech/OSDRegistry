ELFLINT SERIES 

The Elflint series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated tuff. These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Elflint ashy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium    granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; few medium  and common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk1--8 to 17 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) ashy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; disseminated lime; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bk2--17 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) ashy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; disseminated lime; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick) 

    Cr1--30 to 48 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) semiconsolidated  tuff that crushes to loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist. 

    Cr2--48 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) semiconsolidated tuff that crushes to silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist.

COMPETING SERIES: 

Totavi (NM) - does not have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation; does not have a paralithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - alluvial fans and stream terraces. 
Elevation - 3,600 to 6,300 feet. 
Slope - 15 to 35 percent. 
Parent material -  alluvium or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated tuff. 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 19 inches.

Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Elflint soils are primarily used for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue and rough fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Elflint soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record MT1518.  Diagnostic  horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 8 inches (A horizon); a calcic horizon from 8 to 17 inches (Bk1 horizon); a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation from 17 to 30 inches (Bk2 horizon); a paralithic contact at 30 inches (Cr1 horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 30 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).  Elflint soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
