ELMENDORF SERIES

The Elmendorf series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous, clayey residuum weathered from shale. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 885 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: An ustic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section remains dry in some or all parts for 90 or more but less than 180 cumulative days in normal years.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of April through June and October through November.  July through September and January through March are the driest months.  When dry, the soil has cracks up to 5 cm (2 in) wide at the surface and extending to depths of more than 127 cm (50 in).

Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 24 degrees C (72 To 75 degrees F).
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 41 to 137 cm (16 to 54 in)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Coy (TX) series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Cranell (TX), Dacosta (TX), Grail (ND), and Laparita (TX) series.  (The Cranell and Laparita series would compete in the same family once these soils have been updated to the current keys to soil taxonomy.)

Coy soils: are calcareous throughout .
Cranell soils: do not contain gypsum crystals. 
Dacosta soils: are in the udic moisture regime and have a mollic epipedon that is less than 20 inches.
Grail soils: are in the frigid temperature regime and formed in local alluvium from soft siltstone or shale.
Laparita soils: have higher salinity values in the argillic horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous, clayey residuum weathered from shale
Landform: microlows in complex soils areas.  In areas where slopes are greater than 1 percent, these soils occur as valleys in a complex surface of valleys and swells that are perpendicular to the slope contours.
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 73 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation range: 652 to 918 cm (26 to 36 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation falls mostly during the months of April through June and October through November.  July through September and January through March are the driest months.
Frost-free period: 270 to 290 days
Elevation:  46 to 229 m (150 to 750 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 40 to 50

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Clareville, Coy, Denhawken, Laparita, Marcelinas, and Monteola series.

Clareville and Laparita soils occur at lower elevations.  
Coy, Denhawken, Marcelinas, and Monteola soils occur on similar surfaces.  
Denhawken soils lack mollic epipedons and usually occur on micro ridges or knolls in a complex with Elmendorf soils. 
Monteola soils are clayey throughout and have intersecting slickensides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is slow on 0 to 1 percent slopes, medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and high on 3 to 5 percent slopes.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for crop production and livestock grazing.  Main crops are grain sorghum, cotton, corn, and small grains. Livestock grazing areas are mostly improved bermudagrass.  Native vegetation consists of mainly mesquite, cacti, live oak, little bluestem, tricloris, sideoats grama, lovegrass, Arizona cottontop, and vine-mesquite.
