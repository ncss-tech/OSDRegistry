ENERGY SERIES

The Energy series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium.  These soils
are on nearly level flood plains of small streams.  Slopes range
from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Energy fine sandy loam--pasture.
       (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 8 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine
sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard,
friable; common fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; strong effervescence, moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to
18 inches thick)

     C1--8 to 28 inches; stratified brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam and fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm; few fine roots and very fine pores; violent effervescence, moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 24 inches thick)

     C2--28 to 38 inches; stratified brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, and clay loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm; few fine roots and very fine pores; violent effervescence, moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10
to 30 inches thick)

     C3--38 to 44 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; violent effervescence, moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to
10 inches thick)

     C4--44 to 62 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard firm; stratified; violent effervescence, moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Comanche County, Texas; from County Courthouse in Comanche, Texas, 5 miles north on Texas Highway 16 to intersection with Farm Road 2861; then east on Farm Road 2861 0.1 mile; then
north on paved road 0.55 mile; then 70 yards east in pasture.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or
clay loamy with thin strata of loamy sand.  Clay content of 10- to 40-inch control section is 18 to 30 percent, and sand coarser than very fine sand comprises more than 15 percent.  Degree
stratification varies.

The A horizon is light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), pale brown
(10YR 6/3), light gray (10YR 7/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3), very pale brown (10YR 7/3), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  Where the A horizon has moist colors of 3.5 or less, it is less than 10 inches thick.
It is dominantly fine sandy loam, but ranges to sandy clay loam or loam.

The C horizons are brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2), pale
brown (10YR 6/3), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), very pale brown (10YR
7/3, 7/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  Few thin strata of very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or dark brown also occur in the
C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Bosque, Bunyan, Clairemont, Colorado, Loire, Mangum, Varro, Weswood and Yahola series.  Bosque soils have mollic epipedons.  Bunyan soils are noncalcareous in
the upper part.  Clairemont and Weswood soils have fine-silty
control sections and in addition, Weswood soils have a cambic horizon.  Colorado soils have colors with hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Loire soils have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 72 degrees F.  Mangum soils are fine textured.  Varro soils have udic moisture regimes, and Yahola soils are coarse-loamy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Energy soils are on nearly level flood plains
of small streams.  Flooding occurs at intervals of once or twice a year to once each 5 to 20 years.  Slopes range from 0 to 2
percent.  The soil formed in stratified calcareous alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 70 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation from 28 to 40 inches; and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices from 40 to 64.

Geograhically Associated Soils:  These are the competing Bosque, Bunyan, and Weswood series, and the Deleon, Frio, and Lamkin
series.  Deleon and Frio soils have mollic epipedons and have more than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.
Lamkin soils have mollic epipedons and have fine-silty control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for bermuda pastures and pecan orchards.  Some areas are farmed to forage sorghums, peanuts, or alfalfa.  Native vegetation consists of big bluestem, indiangrass, little bluestem, switch grass, and Texas wintergrass with an overstory of pecan and elm trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly along small streams in central Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.
