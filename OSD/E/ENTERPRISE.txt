ENTERPRISE SERIES

The Enterprise series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sediments. These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep plains on terrace pediments in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Enterprise very fine sandy loam, in cropland, at an elevation of 457 m (1,500 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; structureless; soft, very friable; common fine roots; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. 

  A--25 to 46 cm (10 to 18 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky and granular structure; soft, very friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 91 cm [7 to 36 in])

  Bk--46 to 102 cm (18 to 40 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; common white threads and films of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent, moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bk horizon is 31 to 91 cm [12 to 36 in])

  BCk--102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine pores; few faint films and threads of calcium carbonate in upper part; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hardeman (TX), Jester (OK), Miles (TX), and Springer (TX) series. 
Hardeman soils: have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and are on similar positons 
Miles and Springer soils: have an argillic horizon and are on slightly higher positions
Jester soils: have textures coarser than loamy very fine sand throughout and are on slightly lower positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Well drained 
Permeability: moderately rapid 
Runoff: negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 20 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for cropland; sorghum, cotton, and wheat are the main crops. Native vegetation is mainly grama and bluestem grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR H; Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C) and Rolling Limestone Prairie (MLRA 78D) of Texas and Oklahoma adjacent to large streams. The soil is extensive.
