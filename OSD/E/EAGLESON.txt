EAGLESON SERIES

The Eagleson series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and rhyolite. Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Eagleson fine gravelly sandy loam, forested -- on a southeast-facing slope of 56 percent at 6,320 feet elevation. When described on September 13, 2000, the soil was moist to 9 inches and dry below. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.

   A1--1 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium, common coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular and tubular pores; 25 percent fine gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

   A2--10 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium, few coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 30 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 12 inches thick)

   Bw--16 to 27 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine, fine and medium tubular pores; 15 percent stones, 55 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick)

   R--27 inches; slightly weathered granodiorite.

TYPE LOCATION: Boise County, Idaho; about 1.5 miles south of Bogus Basin Ski Area; 2,300 feet south and 1,600 feet east of the northwest corner of section 28, T.5 N., R.3 E.; USGS Robie Creek Quadrangle; Latitude - 43 degrees, 44 minutes, 31 seconds N. and Longitude - 116 degrees, 06 minutes, 31 seconds W.; NAD 83.

C horizons occur in some pedons

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Grousecreek, Patio, Rogger, Sutkin, Terracecreek and Zeb series. Grousecreek, Sutkin and Zeb soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock. Patio and Terracecreek soils have more than 12 percent clay in the particle-size control section. In addition, Terracecreek soils are dry for 90 to 120 consecutive days after the summer solstice. Rogger soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eagleson soils are on strongly sloping to very steep mountain slopes and canyon walls at elevations of 2,800 to 7,600 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and rhyolite. Slopes range from 25 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is 22 to 36 inches. The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Charters, Crumley and Kosh soils. Charters and Crumley soils are very deep to bedrock and occur on similar geomorphic positions. Kosh soils are shallow to bedrock and occur on convex positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Eagleson soils are used mainly for timber production and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, mallow ninebark, Geyers (elk) sedge and mountain snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43. Eagleson soils are moderately extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
Mollic epipedon - zone from the mineral soil surface to 16 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - zone from 11 to 27 inches
Lithic contact - at 27 inches (R)
Soil moisture regime - xeric

All depths related to diagnostic horizons and features listed in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.
