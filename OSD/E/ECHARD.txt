ECHARD SERIES

The Echard series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans and benches.  They formed in soft rhyolitic tuff or strongly cemented ash.  Slope ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 530 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Echard loam--forested (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; aspen and conifer litter.

    A--3 to 16 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine ganular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; few fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt1--16 to 41 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine interstitial and tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble-sized angular fragments of soft tuff or weakly cemented ash; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--41 to 54 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble-size fragments of soft tuff or weakly cemented ash; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt3--54 to 67 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) cobbly clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common medium and few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel and 15 percent cobble-size fragments of soft tuff or weakly cemented ash; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons - 40 to 75 cm)

    BC--67 to 156 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and medium roots; few thin clay films in pores; 10 percent gravel and 15 percent cobble-sized fragments of soft tuff or weakly cemented ash; slightly acid (pH 6.5).

Mean annual temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean summer temperature--11 to 14 degrees C
Frost free period--60 to 65 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Timber and wildlife.  Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, limber pine, aspen, prostrate juniper, Oregon grape, mountain brome, needleandthread grass, slender wheatgrass, squirreltail, and lupine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Echard soils are of small extent in southcentral Utah; MLRA 47.
