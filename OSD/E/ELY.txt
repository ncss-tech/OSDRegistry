Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.3 and 1.0 meter during March to June in years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iowa County, Iowa, 1965

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (BA, Bg1, and Bg2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, BA, Bg1, Bg2, BCg, and Cg horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 81 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, and BA horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 81 to 147 centimeters (Bg1, Bg2, and BCg horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Field experience suggests that these soils are not saturated with water enough of the time to be classified as Aquolls, even though redoximorphic features in the mollic epipedon and the gray colors of the silt and very fine sand coats in the cambic horizon might be interpreted by some as evidence of poor drainage. The typical pedon lacks clear evidence of an erratic organic matter decrease with depth or a content of organic matter in excess of 0.5 percent at a depth of 125 centimeters below the surface, but other evidence suggests that the series is best classified in a Cumulic subgroup.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample 02IA003001, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory.

Some pedons have a Btg horizon but these do not have the clay increase to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.
