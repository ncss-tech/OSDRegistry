ESSEXVILLE SERIES

The Essexville series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy material overlying loamy drift on lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Essexville loamy sand, on a 1 percent slope in an idle field on a lake plain. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 28 cm (11 inches); black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; few fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [28 to 36 cm (11 to 14 inches) thick]

 Bg--28 to 41 cm (11 to 16 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; few fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual irregular boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 C--41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and few fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 46 cm (18 inches) thick]

 2Cg1--66 to 117 cm (26 to 46 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; massive; friable; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; few fine faint gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 76 cm (30 inches) thick]

 2Cg2--117 to 152 cm (46 to 60 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) loam; massive; friable; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; few medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Bay County, Michigan; about 6 miles east and 1 mile south of Essexville; 300 feet north and 1,215 feet west of the center of sec. 25, T. 14 N., R. 6 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to a lithologic discontinuity (2C horizon): 46 to 89 cm (18 to 35 inches)

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 14 percent

A horizon, where present:
Hue: 10YR, or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3

Bg horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 5Y

Chroma: 1 to 4
Redoximorphic features: present in many pedons; chromas of 2 are a result of uncoated mineral grains in pedons that do not have redoximorphic features

2C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Rollersville series. Rollersville soils have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Essexville soils are on lake plains and till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in 46 to 102 cm (18 to 40 inches) of sandy material overlying loamy drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tappan, Kingsville, Belleville, and Wixom soils. The poorly drained Tappan soils are fine-loamy. The very poorly drained Kingsville soils are sandy and noncalcareous. Belleville soils are noncalcareous in the upper part. The somewhat poorly drained Wixom soils are noncalcareous and do not have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy horizons and moderately high in the 2C horizons. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy horizons and moderately slow in the 2C horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Beans, corn, sugar beets, potatoes, and small grain are the principal crops. A few areas of these soils are in idle land or woodland. Wooded areas are chiefly lowland hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in Saginaw Valley and Thumb Area of Lower Michigan and MLRA 103 in Minnesota. This series is of moderate extent.
