EDNA SERIES

The Edna series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on ancient meander ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent but most less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).

Edco and Telf soils: have mixed mineralogy; are derived from sediments of the Lissie Formation.
Texana soils: have a mollic epipedon.

Lake Charles and Laewest soils: clayey throughout on a similar landform

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high.  Water perches on top of the argillic horizon for periods of 2 to 4 weeks following extended heavy rain.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for growing rice and for native range for beef cattle.  Some is used for growing cotton and grain sorghum.  Native grasses are mainly prairie grasses of species of Andropogon, Paspalum, Panicum, and Sporobolus.  Oak, elm, and Hackberry trees have encroached in some areas. (Ecological site name: Tight Sandy Loam 25-35" PZ; Ecological site number: R150AY646TX)

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Prairie of Texas; LRR, MLRA 150A.  The series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Victoria County, Texas; 1910.

REMARKS:  The classification was changed from Vertic Albaqualfs to Vertic Hapludalfs based on the soil moisture study "ISCOM VIII, Classification and Management of Wet Soils, 1990."  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.  Classification change from Vertic Hapludalfs to Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs based on a study of associated soils where significant iron reduction and depletion has been measured in the A and, to a lesser extent, the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Aquic conditions occur for periods long enough in most years to cause iron reduction and mobility, as well as iron oxidation.  In addition, the majority of pedons have value moist of 4 or more and value dry of 6 or more, supporting the Chromic subgroup. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in) (Ap horizon)

Argillic horizon: 23 to 165 cm (9 to 65 in) (Bt and Btk horizons)

Aquertic feature: Cracks and/or wedge-shaped aggregates within the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Intermittent aquic conditions are expressed by value of 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 in the matrix of the upper part of the argillic horizon, in association with masses of oxidized iron in this zone.
