EIMARSH SERIES

The Eimarsh series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, shale, and quartzite.  Eimarsh soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  Lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, shale, and quartzite.

Landform:  Lake plains.

Slope:  0 to 1 percent

Elevation: 4,205 to 4,220 feet

Mean annual temperature:  48 to 52 degrees F.

Mean annual precipitation:  12 to 16 inches.

Wettest months:  October to May.

Driest months:  June to September.

Frost-free period:  140 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Payson, Pintailake, and Saltair soils.  Payson soils have natric horizons and do not have salic horizons.  Pintailake soils do not have salic horizons.  Saltair are fine-silty and have salic horizons within 10 inches of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; high surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 0.8 and 1.7 feet (shallow free water occurrence class) between March and October.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from March through September with water up to 0.5 feet deep.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Eimarsh soils are used for wildlife habitat and rangeland.  Some potential native plants are inland saltgrass, Nebraska sedge, alkali muhly, and alkali bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28A.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bz2 and Czg1 horizons and part of the Czg2 horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S02UT-003-003 (pedon # 02N0156).
