MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Halifax County, Virginia, 2003.

REMARKS: The Easthamlet soils were previously mapped with the Polkton series. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic soil temperature regime boundary necessitated the establishment of the Easthamlet series.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 5 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 5 to 30 inches below the surface (Btss1, Btss2 and Bt3 horizons)
Slickensides--presence of slickensides in the zone from 5 to 24 inches (Btss1 and Btss2 horizons)
Paralithic contact--bedrock contact at a depth of 30 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Linear extensibility--total of 6.0 centimeters or more between the mineral soil surface and paralithic contact
Base saturation by sum of cations--increases with depth and ranges from 35 to 60 percent immediately above the paralithic contact
Presence of hard bedrock at 41 inches (R horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 40 inches
