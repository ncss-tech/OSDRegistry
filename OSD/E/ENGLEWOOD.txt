ENGLEWOOD SERIES

The Englewood series consists of deep, well to moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvial parent materials weathered from adjacent sedimentary bedrock.  They are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Torrertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Englewood clay loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/2) clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    B1--5 to 9 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granules; very hard, friable, plastic; few thin glossy patches on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2) clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 5 inches thick)

    B21t--9 to 21 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay; black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium angular blocks; extremely hard, friable, very plastic; many wax-like patches and seams on faces of peds; wax-like coating in root channels; few shiny slickensides; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    B22t--21 to 28 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay; black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium angular blocky; very hard, friable, very plastic; peds are very hard; may thin wax-like patches and seams on faces of peds; wax-like coatings on root channels and pores; few shiny slickensides; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    B3ca--28 to 34 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium angular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very plastic; few glossy patches on faces of peds; thin glossy coatings in some pores; few shiny slickensides; some visible calcium carbonate occurring as concretions; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4) gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Cca--34 to 60 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) heavy clay loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive, very hard, friable, plastic; some visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions, and in thin seams and streaks; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Colorado; 2,000 feet west of the east 1/4 corner of Sec. 27, T. 7 S., R. 66 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Content of coarse fragments is typically less than 5 percent and ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mottling ranges from none to a few small weak mottles with chroma of more than 2.  The solum and the C horizons are uniform with only minor stratification.

The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.

The B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 7 dry, 2 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and has 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 60 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.   This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay and has 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 60 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.   This horizon is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline and contains 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons lack at C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Denver, Kutch, and Pleasant series.  Denver and Kutch soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Pleasant soils have sola greater than 50 inches thick to the base of the argillic and are noncalcareous in the lower part of the solum and C horizon and lack continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Englewood soils are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slopes usually range from 0 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial parent materials weathered from adjacent sedimentary bedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer months.  The average annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 63 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Sampson and Satanta soils.  Sampson soils are coarse textured Satanta soils are coarser textured and lack thick mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well to moderately well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as native pastureland, although they may be tilled in some areas.  Principal native plants are western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, spike muhly, sideoats grama, blue grama, and little bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Colorado and Wyoming.  The series is of moderate extent.
