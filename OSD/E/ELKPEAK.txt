ELKPEAK SERIES

The Elkpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, or igneous rock. These soils are on escarpments, mountain slopes or landslides. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Elkpeak gravelly fine sandy loam in shrubland on a 12 percent slope at about 2317 meters elevation (colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated).

 A--0 to 22 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak, very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick)  

 Bt1--22 to 37 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent faint clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  

 Bt2--37 to 63 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 45 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  

 Bt3--63 to 87 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 60 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of Bt horizons is 40 to 100 cm thick) 

 BC--87 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).
