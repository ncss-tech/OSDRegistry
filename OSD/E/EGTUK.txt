EGTUK SERIES

The Egtuk series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in eolian deposits on plain talfs. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic Oxyaquic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Egtuk highly organic very fine sandy loam located on a plain with a slope of 5 percent and elevation of 40 meters; when described on August 1st, 2006 the soil was moist from 0 to 25 cm and wet throughout the rest of the profile (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oe--0 to 2 centimeters; moderately decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots and few coarse roots; very strongly acid, pH 4.6; clear wavy boundary

 A--2 to 4 centimeters; very dark gray (7.5YR 3/1) highly organic very fine sandy loam; 50 percent sand; 44 percent silt; 6 percent clay; weak fine granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and few coarse roots; moderately acid, pH 5.6; abrupt wavy boundary

 Bw--4 to 25 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) very fine sandy loam; 50 percent sand; 45 percent silt; 5 percent clay; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; moderately acid, pH 5.6; gradual wavy boundary  

 C--25 to 183 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very fine sandy loam; 50 percent sand; 45 percent silt; 5 percent clay; massive; nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; moderately acid, pH 5.6
