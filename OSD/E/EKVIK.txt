EKVIK SERIES

The Ekvik series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over gravelly colluvium and outwash on river bluffs. Slopes range from 30 to 96 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.4 degrees C.
