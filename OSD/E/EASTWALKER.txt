COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chamita, Cometcrik, Eagleton, Eastdale, Kerkhoven, Kovich, Lakepark, Lobe, Mannixlee, Marshbrook, Marshdale, Nythar, Parle, Sibannac and Welch series. 

Chamita, Cometcrik, Eagleton, Eastdale, Kerkhoven, Lakepark, Lobe, Marshbrook, Nythar, Parle, Sibannac and Welch soils lack sandy-skeletal unconformable layers within 100 to 150 cm depth. Kovich soils have unconformable skeletal layers within depths of 60 to 97 cm.  Mannixlee soils have a cambic horizon.  Marshdale soils have silica cemented Bq horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eastwalker soils are on river terraces and stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,960 to 2,000 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Floatybog, Goodbye and Squishy series.  Floatybog soils have organic surface layers more than 40 cm thick.  Goodbye soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.  Squishy soils have organic surface layers 20 to 40 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 30 cm (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence classes) from November through June. Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent. Some areas of these soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and September.

USE AND VEGETATION: Eastwalker soils are used for pastureland, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly sedges and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
