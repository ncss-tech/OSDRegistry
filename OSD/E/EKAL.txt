EKAL SERIES

The Ekal series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable saline soils formed in intermittent clayey lakebed deposits derived from limestone.  These nearly level depressional and playa soils occur on depressions on dissected plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm (18 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, thermic Vertic Epiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ekal clay--0.5 percent slopes in a dry lakebed.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described, the soil was moist throughout.)

    An--20 to 38 cm (8 to 15 in); gray (10YR 5/1) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 50 cm [10 to 20 in].)

    Bn1--38 to 56 cm (15 to 22 in); light gray (10YR 6/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; vertical cracks filled with soil from above are one-third inch wide; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bn3--91 to 122 cm (36 to 48 in); gray (10YR 6/1) clay, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few white masses of salts one-eighth to one-fourth inch across; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bn horizons is 50 to 127 cm (20 to 50 in].)

    Cn--122 to 145 cm (48 to 57 in); light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (Thickness of the Cn horizons is 51 to 103 cm [20 to 40 in].)

    Cny--145 to 203 cm (57 to 80 in); pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) clay loam, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) moist; extremely hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; 15 percent gypsum crystals; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

Ector soils: are shallow to lithic contact that occurs on ridges and sidelsopes  
Hollomex and Reeves soils: formed in aeolian gypsiferous materials and occupy slightly higher positions
Reagan soils: are in higher positions and have developed in light colored loamy materials
Tobosa soils: are in higher positions and have wedge-shaped peds and slickensides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
