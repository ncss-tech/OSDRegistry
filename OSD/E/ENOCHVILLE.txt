ENOCHVILLE SERIES

The Enochville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. Enochville soils are found on slopes of 0 to 4 percent on floodplains and terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive Cumulic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Enochville silt loam, in rangeland at an elevation of 1,971 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 18 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; few medium distinct brown (10YR 5/3) iron concentrations in matrix; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary

 A2--18 to 33 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine and medium tubular pores; few fine distinct brown (10YR 5/3) iron concentrations in matrix; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary

 Bg1--33 to 64 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium and coarse granular; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse tubular pores; common medium faint brown (10YR 5/3) iron concentrations and few fine distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) iron depletions in matrix; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual smooth boundary

 Bg2--64 to 104 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) crushed, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium and coarse granular; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine and medium tubular pores; common medium faint brown (10YR 5/3) iron concentrations and few fine distinct very dark gray (10YR 3/1) iron depletions in matrix; neutral (pH 6.9); gradual smooth boundary

 Bg3--104 to 135 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) crushed, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine, few medium, and coarse tubular pores; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron concentrations in matrix; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary

 2Cg--135 to 150 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; many medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron concentrations and few fine grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and light gray (2.5Y 7/2) iron depletions in matrix; neutral (pH 7.0)
