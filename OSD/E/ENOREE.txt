ENOREE SERIES

The Enoree series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable loamy soils that formed in fluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, thermic Aeric Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Enoree loam--pasture. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam; many fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; 1 percent pebbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

     Cg1--7 to 15 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sandy loam; many medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) and few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; massive; friable; many fine roots and pores; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

     Cg2--15 to 27 inches; mottled light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam; massive; very friable; many fine roots and pores; thin strata of sandy clay loam and loamy coarse sand; 4 percent pebbles; many fine flakes of mica; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 inches thick)

     Cg3--27 to 50 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sandy loam; massive; very friable; few fine roots; few brown and black stains around old root channels; thin strata of sandy loam and sandy clay loam; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Laurens County, South Carolina; 650 feet east
of South Carolina Highway 56, 450 feet south of Duncan Creek.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral throughout the profile; however, some portion of the 10 to 40 inch control section has a pH of 5.5 or higher.  Flakes of mica range from none to many throughout the profile.  Content of coarse fragments range to as much as 2 percent in the A horizon and to as much as 7 percent throughout the rest of the profile.

The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  When the hue is less than 3.5, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  It is silty clay loam, loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.

The Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  Between the base of the A horizon and 30 inches, the material with chroma of 2 or less totals less than 60 percent of the matrix.
The Cg horizon commonly is stratified sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand with the particle-size control section averaging 10 to 18 percent clay. Below a depth of 30 inches, some pedons have buried horizons  with variable textures, and some pedons have 2C horizons withvariable textures.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Lilbourn series is the only other known series in this family.  Similar soils in other families are Bibb, Cartecay, Chewacla, Convent, Mantachie, and Wehadkee series.  Lilbourn soils are not as wet, flood less frequently, and have a 2Bb horizon.  Bibb soils have more acid and have siliceous mineralogy.  Cartecay and Chewacla soils have dominant colors with chroma of 3 or more.  Convent soils contain less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Mantachie and Wehadkee soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Enoree soils are on nearly level flood plains.  The soils formed in sandy or loamy alluvium.  Near thetype location the mean annual precipitation is 47 inches, mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F, and the frost-free season is 229 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Cartecay, Chewacla, and Wehadkee series, and the Buncombe and Taccoa series.  Buncombe soils are sand or loamy sand to depths exceeding 40 inches. Toccoa soils have dominant chroma of 3 or more between the A horizon and 30 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.  These soils are flooded several times most years.  The water table is at or near the surface for as much as 6 months in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Dominantly used for pasture and forest.  Principal trees are ash, willow, and gum with some pine, cottonwood, and sycamore.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.  The series is of moderate extent.
