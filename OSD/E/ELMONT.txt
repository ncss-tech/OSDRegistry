ELMONT SERIES

The Elmont series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from noncalcareous silty shales. These soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Elmont silt loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes - in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable slightly sticky and slightly plastic; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 centimeters thick) 

  BA--20 to 36 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable sticky and plastic; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to20 centimeters thick) 

  Bt1--36 to 46 centimeters; dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard friable sticky and plastic; thin discontinuous clay films; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

  Bt2--46 to 66 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard firm sticky and plastic; common fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 5/4) iron accumulations; thin, nearly continuous clay films; few fine black concretions; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

  Bt3--66 to 122 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard firm sticky and plastic; coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron accumulations; thin patchy clay films; common fine black concretions; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is (38 to 127 centimeters) 

  Cr--122 to 152 centimeters; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) soft shale. 

TYPE LOCATION: Shawnee County, Kansas; 1.9 miles south of Auburn, Kansas; 2,390 feet south and 25 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 35, T. 13 S., R. 14 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 76 to 152 centimeters. Depth to a paralithic contact with shale ranges from 102 to 152 centimeters  or more. The mollic epipedon is 25 to 61 centimeters thick. The solum ranges from strongly acid to neutral. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 80 or more of the 120 days following the summer solstice in 20 percent or more of the years.

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry  
Chroma: 1 to 3 
Texture:  Silt loam, clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam
Clay content: 22 to 32 percent

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR 
Value: 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry 
Chroma: 2 to 4 
Many pedons have mottles with higher chroma, redder hue, or both, below the mollic epipedon.
Texture: clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay 
Clay content: averages 27 to 35 percent 
Sand content: in the lower part is less than 50 percent. 
Some pedons have a C horizon. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashdale,   Broadwell,    Dinsdale, Douglas, Elkhart,   Healing,  Lycurgus, Malcolm, Meadowbank, Mendota, Mickle, Ogle, Osco, Parkway, Plano, Proctor,  Richwood, Ripon,  Sibley, Sidell, Tama, Tecumseh, Toddville,  Wakenda, and Waupecan series. Similar soils are the Martin, Morrill, and Sibleyville series. 
All of these soils except Malcolm are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 80 out of the 120 days following the summer solstice in 80 percent or more of the years. 
Ashdale soils average more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.
Broadwell, Meadowbank and Waupecan soils average more than 50 percent sand in the lower part of the control section.
Dinsdale, Douglas, Plano, Proctor, Richwood, Sidell, Tama, Toddville, and Waupecan soils average less than 27 percent clay in the lowest part of the control section.
Elkhart and Mendota soils have free calcium carbonate within depths of 102 centimeters.
Healing soils have hue of 5YR or redder in at least some subhorizon in the control section.
Lycurgus and Sibley  soils have a mollic epipedon more than 51 centimeters  thick.
Malcolm soils average less than 27 percent clay in the lowest part of the control section. 
Mickle, Osco, and Parkway soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 centimeters..
Ogle soils are more than 152 centimeters  to the base of the argillic horizon. 
Ripon soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 centimeters. 
Tecumseh soils are more than 152 centimeters to the base of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material:  Residuum weathered from noncalcareous silty shales that can contain thin strata of fine grained sandstone
Landform:  Upland, usually on sideslopes
Slopes:  1 to 12 percent
Mean annual temperature:  10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  76 to 97 centimeters
Thornthwaites Annual P E Index:  Ranges from 50 to 70

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Martin, Pawnee, Sibleyville, Sogn and Vinland soils. Martin soils are on lower positions. Sibleyville, Sogn, and Vinland soils are on similar positions as Elmont soils. Sogn soils have limestone bedrock at depths of less than 51 centimeters. Pawnee soils are on higher positions and have more clay in the argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage:  Well drained
Runoff:  medium or rapid
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:  moderately slow

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Elmont soils are cultivated. Winter wheat, grain sorghums, soybeans, and alfalfa are the principal crops. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses with some scattered deciduous trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Kansas; moderate extent.
