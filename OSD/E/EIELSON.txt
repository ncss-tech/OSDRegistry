TYPE LOCATION: Fort Wainwright Area, Alaska; about 11 miles south east of Fairbanks; in the NW 1/4 of the SE 1/4, section 17, T. 4 S., R. 5 W.; Fairbanks (C-2) 1:63,360 quad; Fairbanks Meridian; UTM north 7179644 and UTM east 452704, zone 6

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the organic mat: 1 to 6 inches (2 to 15 cm)
Depth to sand and gravel: greater than 40 inches (102 cm)
Organic carbon: decreases irregularly with depth
Texture of the control section: stratified silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam and very fine sand
Particle size control section: weighted average of more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 18 percent clay
Mica content: has significant amounts of mica but less than 25 percent
Thin buried organic horizons: may occur throughout the profile

O horizon:
Hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 to 5; and chroma of 1 to 4
Reaction class: strongly acid to neutral

C horizon:
Hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 to 6; and chroma 2 or 3
Texture: stratified with textures including very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, and fine sand
Reaction class: slightly acid or neutral.

Ob horizon:
Hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture: slightly to strongly decomposed plant material
Reaction class: slightly acid or neutral

Bw horizon:
Hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: stratified textures that include silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam
Reaction class: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

C' horizon:
Hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma 2 or 3

Coarse fragments: less than 5 percent
Reaction class: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

Cg horizon:
Hue of 10YR, 2.5Y and N, value of 3 to 6, and chroma 1 or 2
Texture: stratified with textures including very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sand, and may have stratified black organic material
Coarse fragments: less than 5 percent
Reaction class: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

2C horizon (where present):

COMPETING SERIES: none in the same family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: somewhat poorly
Parent material: stratified silty and sandy alluvium
Landform: floodplains
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Climate: is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers
Mean annual temperature: 25 to 28 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chena, Piledriver, Stratify, and Salchaket. Chena and Stratify soils are less than 20 inches (50 cm)to sand and gravel. Piledriver soils are less than 40 inches (100 cm) to sand and gravel. Chena and Salchaket soils are on higher terraces and do not have low chroma redoximorphic depletions within 20 inches (50 cm) of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. A water table is present at a depth of 3 to 6 feet for some period in most summers, allowing capillary rise of water into the soil profile. Runoff is slow. Permeability is moderate in the control section. Subject to rare to occasional flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in native forest consisting of white spruce, cottonwood and quaking aspen with alder shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229 Interior Alaska Lowlands. The series is of minor extent

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Greater Fairbanks Area, Alaska 2002

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: low chroma redoximorphic depletions from 7 to 65 inches; and irregular decrease in organic carbon.

If undisturbed for a long period, buildup of the O horizon reduces soil temperatures and can lead to permafrost formation. Gray soil matrix colors in the lower part of the profile are due to saturation by groundwater.
