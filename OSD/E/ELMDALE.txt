ELMDALE SERIES

The Elmdale series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in fine sandy loam till on ground and recessional moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Elmdale fine sandy loam, on a convex, 3 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; about 3 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 BA--23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loamy fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; very few traces of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy coatings on peds; about 3 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 Bt1--41 to 69 cm (16 to 27 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 3 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--69 to 94 cm (27 to 37 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; about 3 percent rock fragments; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt3--94 to 137 cm (37 to 54 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; few medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; about 3 percent rock fragments; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches).]

 C--137 to 152 cm (54 to 60 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; massive; friable; about 5 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Branch County, Michigan; 240 feet south and 1,570 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 34, T. 5 S., R. 8 W.

Rock fragment content: 0 to 20 percent

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5; 6 or more, dry
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam

A horizon, where present:

Reaction: very strongly acid to neutral

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: fine sandy loam or sandy loam with pockets of loamy sand in some pedons
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dryden and Perrin series. Dryden and Perrin soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Elmdale soils are on ground and recessional moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The Elmdale soils formed in fine sandy loam till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 889 mm (29 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.6 degrees C (47 to 51 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Hillsdale, the somewhat poorly drained Teasdale, and the poorly drained Barry soils form a drainage sequence with Elmdale. The well drained Oshtemo and Spinks soils are also associated in some areas on similar landscape positions. Spinks soils have lamellae and are in a sandy family.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 91 cm (2 to 3 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on the slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation. Small grain, corn, beans, and grass-legume hay are the principal crops. Some areas are idle cropland or have forest vegetation. Common tree species include oak, soft maple, and basswood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 98 in southern Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.
