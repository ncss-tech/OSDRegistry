ESCARLO SERIES

The Escarlo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in uplifted lacustrine and alluvial deposits on hills with a deposit of ash on the surface.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Escarlo soils have slopes of 4 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic Vitrandic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Escarlo gravelly ashy loam - on an 8 percent west by southwest- facing slope at 7,150 feet elevation in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on June 1, 1981, the soil was moist throughout.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    AB--7 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) ashy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    2Bk1--11 to 16 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent fine pebbles; violently effervescent; (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

    2Bk2--16 to 32 inches; white (10YR 8/2) gravelly clay, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent fine pebbles; violently effervescent; (50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bk3--32 to 48 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial pores; 25 percent fine pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; (50 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bk4--48 to 60 inches; white (10YR 8/2) gravelly clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong very thin lamella; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; (63 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); about 2 percent shell fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Escarlo soils are on hills and have slopes of 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 7,500 feet.  The soils formed in uplifted lacustrine and alluvial deposits with a component of ash in the upper part.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer. Average annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches, and average annual temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brabas, Chamberlain, Oxhead, and Heathcoat soils.  Brabas and Oxhead soils are on hills and have ochric epipedons.  Chamberlain soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have loamy-skeletal control sections. Heathcoat soils are on hills and are fine textured with smectitic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lemhi County, Idaho, 1999.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches

Calcic horizon - the zone from 11 to 60 inches

This soil would classify as Vitrandic if such a subgroup existed.

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches

A decrease in carbonates occurs at depths greater than 60 inches
