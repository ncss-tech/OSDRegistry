ECKLEY SERIES

The Eckley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in Tertiary pedisediments.  Eckley soils are on the upland hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eckley gravelly loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; 20 percent pebbles; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

  Bt--4 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak to moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, very friable; common distinct clay films on peds; 20 percent pebbles; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

  BC--12 to 15 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few faint clay films on horizontal and vertical faces of peds, and some clay bridging between sand grains; 30 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

  2C--15 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very gravelly sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; 40 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline.  (Several feet thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Phillips County, Colorado,; 270 feet south and 55 feet east of the north quarter corner of Sec. 17, T. 7 N., R. 47 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature: 49 to 52 degrees F
Depth to contrasting gravelly or very gravelly sand: 12 to 20 inches
Depth to argillic horizon: 4 to 7 inches
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: generally noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches, but may be calcareous below a depth of 30 inches and have some weak accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate in some pedons
Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon: ranges from .7 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly as depth increases

COMPETING SERIES: 
Altvan (NE): are deeper than 20 inches to the coarse textured 2C material and the depth to the base of their argillic horizon
Tuthill (SD): have 2C substratums of loamy sand or fine sand below a depth of 20 inches
Wolfvar (WY): are deeper than 15 inches to the coarse textured 2C material and the depth to the base of their argillic horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: formed in Tertiary pedisediments either in place or slightly reworked
Landform: on the crests of low ridges, shoulders, plains, hills, and valley side slopes 
Slopes: 1 to 30 percent
Elevation: 4200 to 6200 feet
Mean annual temperature: 47 to 52 degrees F, the mean summer temperature is 72 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 19 inches
Precipitation pattern: 10 inches falls during April through August 
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Ascalon: have no contrasting horizon above depth of 40 inches
Blueridge: lack argillic horizon and are sandy throught the control section
Dix: have a sandy-skeletal control section
Platner: have a fine, montmorillonitic control section
Altvan: are deeper than 20 inches to the coarse textured 2C material and the depth to the base of their argillic horizon
Satanta: have no contrasting horizon above depth of 40 inches

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: well drained 
Permeability: moderate
Runoff; low to high

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as dry or irrigated croplands, or as native pastureland.  Typical native vegetation is short grasses, of which blue grama predominates.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Colorado, western Nebraska, eastern Wyoming and southwestern South Dakota.  The series is of moderate extent.
