EMBAL SERIES

The Embal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and volcanic rocks. Embal soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Borobey soils have firm, brittle horizons within 100 cm and have regular decrease in organic matter with depth. Emamount soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have endosaturation between 150 and 180 cm from the soil surface. Frentera, Stookmoor, and Wegert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Gardone soils have mollic epipedons 25 to 38 cm thick, have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, and have regular decrease in organic matter with depth. Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils have buried argillic horizons within 100 cm and buried duripans within 150 cm of the soil surface. Picturerock soils have mollic epipedons 18 to 28 cm thick and have regular decrease in organic matter with depth. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Embal soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, and drainageways. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic ash and volcanic rocks. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,495 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 250 to 360 mm but may range down to 200 mm in some areas in Lake County, Oregon. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, mean January temperatures are -3 to -2 degrees C, and mean July temperatures are 15 to 16 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fertaline and Ninemile soils.  Fertaline soils are moderately deep to a duripan. Ninemile soils are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low surface runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Some phases of these soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between October and May. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Embal soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly is basin big sagebrush, basin wildrye, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 2,500 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
