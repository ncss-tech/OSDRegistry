ELIHILL SERIES

The Elihill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock and calcareous conglomerate. These soils are on hillslopes and fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Elihill sandy clay loam in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 7 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, and few medium roots throughout; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 cm thick)

 Bt1--7 to 26 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots throughout; common fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; 15 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

 Bt2--26 to 40 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; 18 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.

 Btk--40 to 97 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine roots throughout; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; 20 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 20 percent carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments and 5 percent fine carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (50 to 62 cm thick)

 Bk--97 to 145 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; 40 percent carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments and 5 percent fine carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (45 to 52 cm thick)
