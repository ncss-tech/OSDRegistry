EKAH SERIES

The Ekah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium from tertiary aged sediments. These soils  are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.
