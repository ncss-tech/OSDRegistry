EKUK SERIES

The Ekuk series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in loess over fluviomarine deposits on rises of coastal plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 610 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Ekuk silt loam, located on a rise on a coastal plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 5 meters; when described on September 17th, 2007 the soil was moist throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 AC--0 to 11 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; 45 percent sand; 52 percent silt; 3 percent clay; weak fine granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and few coarse roots; 1 percent nonflat 2 to 76 millimeter fragments; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary

 2C--11 to 183 cm; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) very gravelly coarse sand; 90 percent sand; 8 percent silt; 2 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots, many medium roots, and few coarse roots; 54 percent nonflat 5 to 76 millimeter fragments; 1 percent nonflat 2 to 5 millimeter fragments; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8)

TYPE LOCATION: Dillingham Census Area, Alaska; Located in the Village of Ekuk; 58.8075 degrees north latitude and 158.563333 degrees west longitude.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alflack, Canlodore, Castlepeak, Chena, Cryomont, Dagget, Eklutna, Freelpeak, Graylock, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Perfecto, Ragamuffin, Sofgran, Stecum, Studebaker, and Whittell series. Alflack, Dagget, Freelpeak, Graylock, Ragamuffin, Stecum, and Whittell are moderately deep to deep soils formed in residuum or colluvium on mountain slopes with slope gradients that range up to 20 to 75 percent. Castlepeak, Chena, and Eklutna are all excessively drained soils formed in alluvium and/or glacial outwash. Cryomont, Nataga, and Nizina all are formed in alluvium and have slopes that range up to 20 to 40 percent. Canlordore is a well drained soil formed in glacial deposits on mountainsides with slopes from 15 to 40 percent. Perfecto and Sofgran are mountain slope soils formed in colluvium, residuum, or slope alluvium with slopes that range from 8 to 65 percent.  Obscurity is formed in mud flow material and Studebaker is formed in avalanche debris.
