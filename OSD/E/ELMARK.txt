ELMARK SERIES 

The Elmark series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Elmark sandy clay loam, bouldery, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 5 cm; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. (1 to 5 cm thick) 

    A--5 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 13 cm thick) 

    E--13 to 23 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick) 

    Bt--23 to 53 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films bridging sand grains and ped faces; 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 58 cm thick) 

    BC--53 to 81 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 30 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear irregular boundary. (0 to 50 cm thick) 

    Cr--81 to 150 cm; olive (5Y 5/3) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) which crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots in upper 3 to 5 cm of horizon; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (38 to 76 cm thick) 

    R--150 cm; hard granite bedrock.
