ETOE SERIES

The Etoe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial-colluvial material from sandstone and shale. Etoe soils are on steep and very steep slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Palecryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Etoe loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

    Oe--3 to 6 cm; moderately decomposed forest litter.

    E1--6 to 14 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak, very fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; less than 5 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    E2--14 to 34 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grained and weak very fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly plastic; many few fine coarse and medium roots; many fine pores; less than 10 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    E/B--34 to 67 cm; 85 percent (E) pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; and 15 percent (B) strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) cobbly fine sandy loam, dry and moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine, few coarse and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 25 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    B/E--67 to 97 cm; 25 percent (B) strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) dry and moist, very cobbly fine sandy loam and 75 percent (E) pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few coarse and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 40 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt1--97 to 138 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky and moderate fine granular structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine pores; thick, patchy clay films; 60 percent rock fragments; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (30 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt2--138 to 191 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many fine pores; thick patchy clay films; 70 percent rock fragments; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Colfax County, New Mexico; about 19 km south of Eagle Nest, about 2 km north-northwest of point where U. S. Highway 64 leaves the Morino Valley
