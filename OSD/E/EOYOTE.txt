EOYOTE SERIES

The Eoyote series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Eoyote soils are on terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Eoyote fine sandy loam--cropland. On a 1 percent slope, 4,210 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on August 13, 1997, the soil was moist throughout.

	Ap--0 to 8 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick)

	Bk1--8 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak moderate subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

	Bk2--18 to 36 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0; abrupt smooth boundary. (14 to 22 inches thick)

	Bk3--36 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). 

TYPE LOCATION: Minidoka County, Idaho; about 3 miles northwest of Paul, Idaho; in the southwest 1/4 southwest 1/4 southeast 1/4 of section 18, T.9S., R.23E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Average annual soil temperature - 49 to 51 degrees F.
Depth to bedrock - more than 60 inches
Depth to the calcic horizon - 8 to 12 inches
Control section - averages 8 to 14 percent clay

A horizon 
Value - 4 or 5 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3

Bk horizon
Value - 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma 2 or 3
Reaction - moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline
Effervescence - strong or violent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Declo, Escalante, Palisade, Somsen and Strevell series. Declo, Palisade and Strevell soils have particle-size control section textures of silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam. Strevell soils are moderately deep to loamy-skeletal horizons. Somsen soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Escalante soils receive brief periods of intermittent summer precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eoyote soils are on terraces. They formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,140 to 4,175 feet. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches. The average annual temperature is 49 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is  130 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Woozle soil. Woozle soils have fine-loamy control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Eoyote soils are used for irrigated cropland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This soil is of small extent in south central Idaho.
