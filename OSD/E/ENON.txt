REMARKS:
The May 2006 revision was to clean up text only. No major revisions. (RHB)
The April 2022 revision removed an offensive series name replaced with Hallsummit (RBT). The September 2025 revision changed the format.  No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 20 to 84 centimeters (8 and 33 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Ultic feature--the base saturation of 35 to 60 percent at a depth 1.25 m below the top of the argillic horizon.
