ESTHERVILLE SERIES 

The Estherville series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loamy sediments over sandy and gravelly outwash. These soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, valley trains, and kames on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Estherville sandy loam, on a plane slope of about 1 percent, on a glacial outwash plain, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 327 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)
