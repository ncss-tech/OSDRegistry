ECHOCREEK SERIES

The Echocreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and shale.  Echocreek soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Echocreek loam, on a northwest facing, linear, 4 percent slope in alfalfa at an elevation of 5395 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on May 27, 1975, the soil was moist throughout.

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary (0 to 8 inches thick).

    A1--7 to 18 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary (8 to 20 inches thick).

    A2--18 to 26 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick).

    Bk1--26 to 38 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak and moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary (10 to 20 inches thick).

    Bk2--38 to 45 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bk3--45 to 60 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Summit County, UT; about 1 mile southeast of Henefer; located about 1,800 feet east and 300 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 10, T. 3 N., R. 4 E.; Henefer, Utah USGS quad; lat. 41 degrees 00 minutes 08 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 29 minutes 32 seconds W., NAD 1927

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime:  Xeric moisture regime bordering on Aridic; the soil moisture control section is dry for 60 or more consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 47 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature:  58 to 65 degrees F.
Surface rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent gravels
Depth to lithic contact:  Greater than 60 inches
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate:  20 to 30 inches
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  20 to 30 inches

Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry
Chroma:  2 or 3 moist and dry
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 3 percent
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline

Bk horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR
Value:  3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry
Chroma:  2 to 4 moist or dry
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  3 to 15 percent
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Koosharem, Roschene, Toehead, and Zola series.
Koosharem: have igneous rock fragments in the particle-size control section 
Roschene:  has redox concentrations from 30 to 60 inches and is moderately well drained.
Toehead:  has 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Zola:  has redox concentrations from 36 to 54 inches and is moderately well drained; has 27 to 33 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Echocreek soils
Parent material:  Alluvium derived from sandstone, quartzite, and shale.
Landform:  Stream terraces
Slopes:  2 to 10 percent
Elevation: 5,200 to 8,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 18 inches.
  Wettest months:  March through May.
  Driest months:  July through September.
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ant Flat, Heiners, Kovich, and Richsum.  
  Ant flat soils are fine textured soils on higher fan remnants.
  Heiners soils are shallow to bedrock and occur on hillslopes.
  Kovich soils occur on poorly drained flood plains.
  Richsum soils are medium textured soils on hillslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to medium runoff, moderate permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major use is livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is basin big sagebrush, wheatgrass, bluegrass and basin wildrye.  In Utah this series is correlated with Upland Loam (Basin Big Sagebrush) ecological sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Utah  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Summit County, Utah, 1998 .  The name is a creek in Summit County.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 27 inches (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons).
Irregular decrease in organic carbon (Cumulic feature): inferred from the landform position and the thick mollic epipedon.
Cambic horizon: from 27 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons).
