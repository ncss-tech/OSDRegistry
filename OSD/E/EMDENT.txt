SERIES ESTABLISHED: Adams County, Washington; 1965

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from surface to a depth of 41 cm
*Aquic conditions--zone from 41 to 150 cm
*Effervescence--all parts of zone from 25 to 100 cm
*Exchangeable sodium percentage--more than 15 percent in upper 50 cm, decreases as depth increases
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

The classification was changed from ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Typic Vitriaquands to ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Aquandic Endoaquolls based on laboratory data. The ash in the Emdent soils is from the eruption of Mount Mazama. The content of ash is very high, but because of the sustained water table it is not weathered enough to meet the acid oxalate Al plus 1/2 Fe criteria for andic soil properties.

6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The PLSS details place the location of the pedon in an area of Anders silt loam, 0 to 5 percent slopes. The type location should be investigated and potentially moved to a more appropriate location. The formatting of this OSD was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
