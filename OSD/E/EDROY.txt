EDROY SERIES

The Edroy series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey over loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are in enclosed depressions.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 cm (27 in).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Banquete (TX), Eastall (OK), Hansford (TX), Ness (KS), Ranco (TX), Randall (TX), Rosston (OK), and Ustibuck (OK) series.
Banquete soils: are Udic Haplusterts and do not pond water for long periods.
Eastall soils: are in a thermic temperature regime and have colors redder than 10YR in the subsoil.
Hansford and Ness soils: are in a mesic temperature regime
Ranco, Randall, Rosston, Ustibuck soils: are in a thermic temperature regime
Ustibuck soils: are in a thermic temperature regime and have colors redder than 10YR throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: clayey over loamy fluviomarine deposits of late Pleistocene age
Landform: enclosed depressions on the coastal plain
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 21.7 to 22.8 degrees C (71 to 73 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 in)
Precipitation Pattern: The wettest months are September and October and from April through June. The driest months are January to March.
Frost-free period: 301 to 365 days
Elevation: 4.6 to 30.5 m (15 to 100 ft) 
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 31 to 44 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Banquete, Cranell, Calallen, and Victoria series.
Banquete soils: are in shallow depressions and swales on flats, and are moderately well drained
Cranell soils: are on flats and have a loamy surface
Calallen soils: are on flats and have a loamy surface and subsoil
Victoria soils: are on flats and are well drained

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is negligible.  The soil is ponded for very long periods during the spring and fall months in normal years.  These soils are saturated throughout during the ponded periods and have reducing conditions..

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are mostly used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  A few areas are planted to crops during dry years.  Grain sorghum and cotton are the main crops.  Hydrophytic vegetation dominates these soils in native areas.  The ecological site is Lakebed, PE, 25-35 (R150AY641TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Prairies (MLRA 150A in LRR T) on the Coastal Bend of southern Texas.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Welder Wildlife Refuge, San Patricio County, Texas, 1971.

REMARKS:  Classification changed from Vertic Haplaquolls to Ustic Epiaquerts 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  The series geomorphic setting was revised as a result of the update of MLRA 150A and the initial soil survey of Kenedy and Kleberg counties, Texas.  Originally, the series was mapped as two phases, a depressional phase and a relict drainage phase.  The soils of the two geomorphic positions classify differently.  The revised concept is having the Edroy series in enclosed depressions, while the relict drainage areas will be identified as the Banquete series as originally mapped in the 1965 soil survey of Nueces County, TX.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 104 cm (0 to 41 in). (A, Bw, and Bss1)
Vertic features: pressure faces and slickensides 18 to 178 cm (7 to 70 in). (Bw, Bss1, Bss2, and Bkss horizons)
Aquic feature: ponding and reducing conditions in most years
