ESPA SERIES

The Espa series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated beach and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. Espa soils are on hills and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

UTM Zone 10 411041mE 4575503mN, NAD83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  The soil is usually moist in all parts in the soil moisture control section in most years, but becomes nearly dry in the upper part from about September 15 to October 15 in most years. The soils have an udic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  The mean annual soil temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F). The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 2 to 4 degrees C. The soils have an isomesic temperature regime.

Organic Matter: There is 12 to 25 kg per square meter of organic carbon to a depth of one meter.

Reaction is moderately to very strongly acid throughout. Base saturation is 5 to 35 percent between depths of 25 to 200 centimeters.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ladybird, Ossagon and Stonehill series. Ladybird soils have angular rock fragments throughout. Ossagon soils do not have the clay mineral halloysite in the clay mineral fraction. Stonehill soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Espa soils occur on broad ridgetops, upper hillslopes and dissected marine terrace remnants. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6 to 245 meters (15 to 805 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated beach and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 2285 millimeters (35 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 12 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 280 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ossagon, Squashan, Surpur, Candymountain, and the Lepoil soils. Ossagon soils have rounded rock fragments throughout. Squashan soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Surpur soils have an ochric epipedon and are found on broad ridge tops at higher elevations, farther inland. Candymountain soils are course loamy and have a cambic epipedon.  Lepoil soils have an argillic horizon that does not have a clay decrease of 20 percent or more (relative) from the maximum clay content with in 150cm of the mineral soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber and is used for wildlife recreation, and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of redwood, Sitka spruce, red alder, Douglas fir, western hemlock, tanoak, cascara, western thimbleberry, salmonberry, salal, and swordfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt Del Norte Area, California 2007. Source of name is from Espa Creek north of the town of Orick.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 7 to 41 centimeters (A, and ABt horizons). 
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 41 to 156 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).
3. Ultisol feature - base saturation of 20 percent at the critical depth, 125 centimeters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon
4. Haplohumult features - Clay does not remain at least 80 percent of its maximum to a depth of 150 centimeters
5. Particle-size control section - the zone from 41 to 91 centimeters, averages 28 percent clay, and 44 percent fine sand and coarser (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).
