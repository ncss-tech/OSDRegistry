ELLA SERIES

The Ella series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 102 to 203 centimeters of silty alluvium, or a combination of loess and silty alluvium, and in the underlying stratified slackwater deposits. These soils are on treads and low risers on dissected stream terraces in valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.
