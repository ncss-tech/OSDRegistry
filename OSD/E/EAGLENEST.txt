EAGLENEST SERIES

The Eaglenest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 309 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Mean annual precipitation - 250 to 360 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 6 to 8 degrees C
Frost-free period - 110 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None Listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow to rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Eaglenest soils are primarily used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat but are also used for growing alfalfa and grass hay mixtures. Native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, and needleandthread. Sites are susceptible to drought or misuse, deteriorating into a threadleaf sedge dominated community.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eaglenest soils are of small extent in northwestern Wyoming. MLRA 32.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Park County, Wyoming, 2015. The name is taken, in part, from the USGS quadrangle in which it's located.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric Epipedon - from 0 to 8 cm (A horizon)
Argillic Horizon - from 8 to 68 cm (Bt and Btk horizons)
