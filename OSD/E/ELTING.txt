COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mirror Lake, Priestlake, and Tolby soils. Mirror Lake, Priestlake, and Tolby soils have a presumed mean annual soil temperature greater than 36 degrees F (2 degrees C.).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly outwash
Elevation: 2,244 to 3,294 feet (684 to 1,004 m)
Slope: 2 to 48 percent
Annual precipitation: 28 to 35 inches (700 to 894 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degree F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 60 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Basaltlake and Sonderna soils. Basaltlake soils are well drained, very deep and occur on mountains. Sonderna soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loamy part of the solum and high to very high in the sandy-skeletal part of the profile.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is white spruce/green alder forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
