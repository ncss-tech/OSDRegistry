COMPETING SERIES:
Hurricane soils-- have a spodic horizon at a depth of more than 50 inches
Mandarin soils-- have a Bh horizon within 30 inches of the surface 
Melvina soils-have a spodic horizon at a depth of 12 to 30 inches and have an argillic horizon below the spodic
Ridgeland soils-- do not have an E horizon above the Bh horizon 
Rigdon soils-- have an argillic horizon at a depth of 24 to 40 inches 

  These are the Hurricane, Mandarin, and Ridgeland series in the same family.  Hurricane soils have a spodic horizon at a depth of more than 50 inches.  Mandarin soils have a Bh horizon within 30 inches of the surface.  Ridgeland soils do not have an E horizon above the Bh horizon.  The Chipley, Leon, Rimini, Scranton, and Seewee series are similar soils in related families.  Chipley and Scranton soils do not have a Bh horizon.  Leon and Seewee soils have a Bh horizon at a depth of less than 30 inches, and in addition have a seasonal high water table above a depth of 2.5 feet.  Rimini soils have uncoated grains of sand in the E horizon and depth to the Bh horizon ranges from 50 to 80 inches.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Berkeley County, South Carolina; 1974.

REMARKS:  In the spodic horizon the C+Fe+A1 ratio to clay is 0.22. The organic carbon content is 0.34.  This data is by Beltsville Laboratory for one pedon.  These soils were studied as series C in the Classification of Soils in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina of September 1968.

Decision made that this soil typically has saturation within 40 inches of the soil surface for a duration long enough to support the Oxyaquic subgroup. Reclassified accordingly in 2000.

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 40 inches (A, E1, E2 and E3 horizons).
Albic horizon - the zone from 27 to 40 inches (E3 horizon).
Spodic horizon - the zone from 40 to 50 inches (Bh horizon).
