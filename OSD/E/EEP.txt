EEP SERIES

The Eep series consists of well drained, very deep soils that formed in colluvium from volcanic ash and welded tuff.  They are on breaks and scarps.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 6 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eep very cobbly sandy loam - on a west facing slope of 25 percent under rangeland vegetation at 1,850 meter elevation.  When described on April 15, 1981, the soil was slightly moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(10 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt1--23 to 43 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many roots; many very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 40 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.

(20 to 64 cm thick)

    BC--66 to 97 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly sandy ashy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine to medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 36 cm thick)

    C--97 to 193 cm; white (10YR 8/1) unconsolidated ashy loamy sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (76 to 152 cm thick)

    Cr--193 to 198 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) consolidated ash, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adamatt, Chesebro, Crazybird, Dawgbuffer, Epvip, Lyonman, Monasterio, Rancheria, Tourn, Vetash, Warnermount, and Willowak series. 
Adamatt, Crazybird, Epvip, Rancheria soils are shallow. 
Chesebro soils have an argillic horizon with a depth to the base of 114 to 150 cm. 
Crazybird, Dawgbuffer soils are very shallow. 
Lyonman, Monasterio, Tourn, Warnermount, and Willowak soils are moderately deep. 
Vetash soils average less than 65 percent volcanic glass content throughout and receives less than 400 millimeters precipitation annually. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Eep soils are on breaks, hillslopes, and scarps.  The slope ranges from 6 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from welded tuff.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,075 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 560 mm.  The average annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost free season is 60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amboat, Brose, Dehana, Howcree, Keman, and Mug soils.  Amboat soils are clayey-skeletal and occur on summits. Brose soils are shallow to bedrock and occur on summits.  Dehana soils are not skeletal, are cryic, and occur on the same landscape, but on wetter exposures.  Keman soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on summits. Mug soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Howcree and Mug soils occur on terraces.  Howcree soils are clayey-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, medium or rapid runoff; moderate permeability, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Eep soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, needleandthread, Idaho fescue, lupine, and stoneseed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eep soils are of moderate extent in south central Idaho. MLRA 25.
