ENBAR SERIES 

The Enbar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, drainageways, and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fergus County, Montana, 1979. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 22 inches (A1, A2, A3 horizons)
Gleying - the zone from 30 to 51 inches (Cg1, Cg2 horizons)
Discontinuity - the zone from 51 to 61 inches (2C horizon)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (A2, A3, C, Cg1 horizons).  

Enbar soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

Soil interpretation record:  MT0357, MT0821.

C and Cg1 horizon should be investigated in the future to determine if they would be better described as Bw and Bg1 horizons.
