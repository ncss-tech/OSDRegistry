SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Greenville County, South Carolina, 1972

REMARKS:  The 1/98 revision places Evard series in a parasesquic mineralogy family.  Evard soils were formerly in an oxidic mineralogy.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 cm, 0 to 5 inches (A and E horizons)
b. Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 58 cm, 5 to 29 inches (Bt horizons)c. Parasesquic mineralogy class - total iron oxide, by weight (DCB Fe multiplied by 1.43) plus percent, by weight, gibbsite of more than 10 in the fine-earth fraction.
d. Series control section--the zone from 10 to 64 cm, 5 to 25 inches.
