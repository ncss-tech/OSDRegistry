ENDLICH SERIES

The Endlich series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium from granite, breccia, rhyolite, andesite, or tuff.  Endlich soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Typic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Endlich very stony loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed organic material, principally needles, bark, twigs, and leaves.

     Oe--1 to 2 inches; partially decomposed organic material like that of the horizon above.

     E--2 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel, 40 percent stones; extremely acid; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

     Bw--9 to 24 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very stony loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel, 40 percent stones; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 36 inches thick)

     R--24 inches; granite bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Endlich soils are on hills, ridges, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from granite, breccia, tuff, andesite, or rhyolite.  Mean annual temperature is 30 to 34 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 33 to 50 inches.  Elevation is 10,000 to 12,000 feet.   Frost-free season is 50 days or less.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Grenadier and the Leal soils.  Grenadier soils do not have bedrock above a depth of 40 inches.  Leal soils are coarser textured and do not have bedrock above a depth of 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for summer wildlife habitat, limited forestry, and recreation.  Native vegetation consists of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir with understory of common snowberry, dwarf blueberry, elk sedge, Myrtle boxleaf, and kinnikinnick.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  MLRA 48A.  The series is of moderate extent.
