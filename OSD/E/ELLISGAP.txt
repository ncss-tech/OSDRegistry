COMPETING SERIES: Thes are the Apun (AK), Chakina (AK), Crosswind (AK), Foggypass (AK), Pupcreek (AK), Saintelias (AK), Slatka (AK), and Tulebagh (AK) soils.
Apun soils are poorly drained, do not have a till in the lower horizons, and occur on river valley terraces
Chakina soils have permafrost starting below 100 cm (39 in) and occur on mountain slopes.
Crosswind soils are poorly drained, have a mollic epipedon, are shallower to permafrost, and occur on river valleys and bluffs in lake plains.
Domeworld soils are poorly drained and occur on turf hummocks in mountains.
Foggypass soils have coarse fragments in the subsurface horizons.
Pupcreek soils are poorly drained, have colluvium as its parent material, and occur on hills.
Saintelias soils are poorly drained, forms over lacustrine sediments, and occur on terraces and in river valleys.
Slatka soils are somewhat poorly drained, shallower to permafrost, and occur on mountain slopes.
Tulebagh soils are poorly drained and occur on stream terraces and interdunes on alluvial plains.
