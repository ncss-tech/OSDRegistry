ESLENDO SERIES

The Eslendo series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. Eslendo soils are on ridges, hills, mesas, and backslopes of escarpments. Slopes are 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Eslendo clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic few fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

 C--3 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 16 inches thick)

  Cr--10 inches; soft shale bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Sandoval County, New Mexico. 16 miles south of Lybrook, 1,760 feet south and 2,400 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 29 T. 21 N., R. 7 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Usually dry, moist in some parts periodically from July 1 through October and January through March. Driest during May and June. Ustic aridic moisture regime.

Soil depth: 4 to 20 inches to soft shale

Soil temperature: 48 to 56 degrees F.

Calcium carbonate: less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent

Particle-size control section - clay content: 18 to 35 percent

Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent dominantly gravel

A horizon 
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Texture: loam, silt loam, clay loam, very channery fine sandy loam, silty clay loam

C horizon 
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR, 5Y, 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 8, dry or moist
Texture: loam, clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Canyon (NE), Epping (NE), Gerst (UT), Picante (CO), Quarteles (NM), Redarrow (WY), Remorris (UT), Sandoval (NM), Shingle (WY), Simel (UT), Taluce (WY), Tesihim AZ) and Tassel (NE) series. Gerst soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Taluce and Tassel soils have less than 18 percent clay. Epping soils contain significant amounts of glass shards. Quarteles soils have significant amounts of mica. Remorris and Redarrow soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder. Picante soils are dry for a shorter period of time before July 15 and are moist for a longer period following the winter solstice. Sandoval soils are moist for shorter periods of time during January through March. In addition, Canyon, Epping, Redarrow, Tassel, Shingle, and Taluce soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June. Simel soils have a lithic contact underlaying the paralithic contact. Tesihim soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eslendo soils are on ridges, hills, mesas, and backslopes of escarpments. Slopes are 1 to 70 percent. Elevations are 4,900 to 7,000 feet. The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale, sandstone and siltstone. The mean annual precipitation is typically 9 to 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 46 to  54 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 100 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Councelor and Mespun soils. Councelor soils are deep, and Mespun soils are deep and sandy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium to very high runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Eslendo soils are used for livestock grazing. The native vegetation is Indian ricegrass, galleta, blue grama, and Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northcentral New Mexico and northeast Arizona. MLRA 35, LRR-D. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)
Paralithic contact - the boundary at 10 inches (Cr horizon)
Entisol feature - lack of diagnostic subsurface horizons (C1, C2 horizons)
