EGUAJE SERIES 

The Eguaje series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt. Eguaje soils are on rolling basalt mesas and lava plateaus. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Calcidic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Eguaje cobbly clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(3 to 7 inches)

(7 to 12 inches) 

    Btk1-- 14 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few distinct clay films on ped faces; 30 percent pebbles; 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; common fine masses of calcium carbonate; 17 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 9 inches) 

    Btk2-- 19 to 28 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; 35 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; common fine masses of calcium carbonate; 34 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches) 

    Bk--28 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles; 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  A closely similar soil is the Delenbaw (AZ) series. 
Delenbaw soils: do not have a calcic horizon and have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: colluvium and residuum from basalt
Landform: undulating basalt capped mesas and lava plateaus. 
Slopes: 1 to 15 percent
Elevation: 5,500 to 7,000 feet
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 17 inches

Mean annual temperature: 50 to 53 degrees F. 
The frost-free period: 125 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Apache, Ayon, Demayo, and Torreon soils. 

Apache and Demayo soils: have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches and are on summits and shoulders.
Ayon soils: do not have an argillic horizon and are on backslopes and summits
Torreon soils: average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on nearly level areas. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes and high on 5 to 15 percent slopes; permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Eguaje soils are used primarily for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is mainly blue grama, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, little and big bluestems, and small amounts of shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Colorado. LRR G, MLRA 70. The series is of small extent.
