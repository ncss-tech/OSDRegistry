ELAERO SERIES

The Elaero series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Elaero soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Elaero very gravelly loamy coarse sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered with 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 7 percent stones.

    Cr--53 to 79 cm; weathered granodiorite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mono County, California; on the Toiyabe National Forest about 1 mile west of Huntoon Valley; approximately 400 feet north and 1,600 feet east of the southwest corner of section 9, T. 5 N., R. 24 E.; USGS Mount Jackson 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 38 degrees 18 minutes 5.5 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 20 minutes 7.4 seconds west longitude, NAD27; UTM Zone 11; 295788e, 4241851n.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section during late fall, winter, and spring; dry from July through early October; xeric moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 50 cm; includes the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons.
Depth to bedrock - 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 12 to 18 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 mm diameter) gravel.  Lithology of fragments is granitic rocks such as granodiorite.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clanalpine, Devaul, Heechee, Heenlake, Holmes, Horrocks, Hoskin, Howcan, Longday, Pequop, Moreypeak, Suak, Valmar, Vitale, and Wambolt series.

Clanalpine and Moreypeak soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Devaul soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Heechee, Holmes, Howcan, Longday, Pequop, and Wambolt soils are very deep.  Heenlake soils average 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have rock fragments that are volcanic rocks, and have paralithic material of weathered volcanic rock in the series control section.  Horrocks soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Hoskin, Suak, Valmar, and Vitale soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elaero soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.   Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,150 to 2,600 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Granhogany, Granidry, and Lockgate soils.  Granhogany soils are sandy-skeletal, shallow to paralithic contacts, and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Granidry soils are shallow to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils have thick mollic epipedons and are deep to paralithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Elaero soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, western needlegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, and Indian ricegrass. This pedon is correlated to R022AY043NV, South Slope 14-16" P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California and western Nevada, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,600 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRAS 22A AND 26.
