COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Eastrange soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are from 1,900 to 3,600 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm moist winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but a significant portion is received between July and September following convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 7 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Dime, Fortirwin, Owlshead, and Crackerjack soils. Arizo soils are on alluvial fans and on inset fans, and do not have a calcic or sodic horizon. Dime soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section. Fortirwin soils have a loamy particle-size control section and are shallow to an indurated duripan. Owlshead and Crackerjack soils have loamy-skeletal and loamy particle-size control sections, respectively, and are shallow to a cambidic duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very low to medium runoff; moderate over rapid or very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Eastrange soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage, desert senna, and fluffgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.
