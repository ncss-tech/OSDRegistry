ESTRADA SERIES

The Estrada series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Estrada soils are on footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

Albinas, Farnum, Funmar, Haxtun, Renner, and Tracylee have hues more yellow than Estrada.  Farnum, Funmar, Keya, and Wetterdon do not have visible carbonates within 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Estrada soils are on toeslopes of valley sides. They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,400 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. Mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altezita, Esquila, Herrada, Sabroso and Verona soils.  Altezita soils are very shallow, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on beveled summits.  Esquila soils are clayey, do not have a mollic epipedon, have smecitic mineralogy, and occur on toeslopes of plateaus. Herrada soils are fine-loamy, do not have a mollic epipedon, and occur on summits and footslopes of undulating plateaus.  Sabroso soils are clayey-skeletal, do not have a mollic epipedon, and occur on south-facing backslopes of mesas.  Verono soils are clayey-skeletal and are on north-facing backslopes of mesas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Estrada soils are used for livestock grazing, woodland production, and recreation. Present vegetation is mountain muhly, penstemon, twoneedle pion, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, and oneseed juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Estrada soils are of small extent on the northern Glorieta Slope part of the Pecos Valley section of the Great Plains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 70A.

SERIES PROPOSED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update;
1996. Estrada is a Spanish surname. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - 0 to 55 inches. (A, AB, Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, Btk2, and Bt1 horizons) 

Argillic horizon - 4 to 104 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, Btk2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)
