EYAK SERIES

The Eyak series consists of poorly drained fine silty soils formed in alluvial and deltaic deposits.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 130 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, nonacid Typic Cryaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Eyak silt loam, sedges. (Colors are for moist soil).

     01--1 to 0 inch; undecomposed litter.

     A1--0 to 2 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam with admixture of partially decomposed sedge leaves; medium coarse subangular blocky structure; firm, slightly sticky, plastic; common roots; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

     B21g--2 to 28 inches; dark gray (5YR 4/1) silt loam with admixture of partially decomposed sedge leaves; common medium distinct mottles of yellowish red (5YR 4/6); medium coarse subangular blocky structure, firm, slightly sticky, plastic; few roots; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

     B22e--28 to 40 inches; dark grey (N4/ ) fine sandy loam with admixture of partially decomposed sedge leaves; massive; slightly sticky, plastic; no roots; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Copper-Bering River Area, Alaska.  Near Tiedeman Slough, about 12 miles southeast of Cordova, in the SW1/4 SW1/4, Sec. 6, T.17S., R.1W, Copper River Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Texture of the soil ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam, and sandy lenses are common at any depth.  Colors range in hue from 5Y to 5YR, in value from 4 to 5, and in chroma from neutral to 1.  Mottling may or may not be present.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Reedy series of the same family, and the Bartlett, Funter, Kaskulu, Kriwoi, Sumdum, and Ustay series.  The Reedy soils have stratified upper horizons over a fine-silty substratum.  The Bartlett soils have a sandy substratum and are calcareous.  The Funter and Kriwoi soils consist of moderately thick organic materials over a stratified substratum.  The Kaskulu soils are acid in reaction.  The Sumdum soils are acid, have no stratification, and have fine texture throughout.  The Ustay soils have a coarse loamy texture

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Eyak soils occupy portions of large deltas adjacent to streams within the delta.  The climate is cool maritime with mean annual precipitation of 80 to 130 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. and average summer air temperature is about 52 degrees F. The soils are seldom frozen.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Funter, Kriwoi, and Ustay series and the Kushtaka series. The Kushtaka soils occupy recent dunes composed of stratified sandy and silty materials.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The vegetation consists dominantly of sedges, willow, and alder.  The soils are useful only as wildlife habitat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The soil occupies portions of deltas and glacial outwash plains bordering the north coast of the Gulf of Alaska.  It is of moderate extent.
