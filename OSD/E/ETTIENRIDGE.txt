ETTIENRIDGE SERIES  

The Ettienridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from limestone.  These soils occur on mountain slopes, hillslopes, canyons, and structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Ustic Calcicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Ettienridge very gravelly loam, in forest on a 45 percent north slope at an elevation of 1842 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oi--0 to 8 cm; Moss and slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 cm thick)

 A--8 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick) 

 Bk1--20 to 42 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; continuous prominent calcium carbonate casts on bottoms of rock fragments and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.   

 Bk2--42 to 74 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; continuous prominent calcium carbonate casts on bottoms of rock fragments and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bk horizons - 30 to 80 cm thick) 

 R--74 to 152 cm; hard limestone bedrock.
