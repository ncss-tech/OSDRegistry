EXETTE SERIES

The Exette series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on short, convex to linear side slopes and head slopes on uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fayette County, Iowa, 1975.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (BA, Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (60 inches) (Ap, BA, Bw1, Bw2, BC, C1 and C2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (Ap horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 15 to 104 centimeters (6 to 41 inches) (BA, Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomy version--second edition, 1999.

The gray colors described in this pedon were not used in the classification of this soil as they are considered to be inherited from a relict deoxidized and leached weathering zone
