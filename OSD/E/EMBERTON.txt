EMBERTON SERIES

The Emberton series consists of soils that are somewhat excessively drained and moderately deep to bedrock, that formed in wind modified alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Emberton loamy fine sand - on a slope of 2 percent under rangeland vegetation at 3,800 feet elevation.  When described on May 5, 1980, the soil profile was slightly moist from 0 to 34 inches and moist below. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose; common roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--8 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; loose; common roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 29 inches thick)

    C2--32 to 39 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    3R--39 inches; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Feltham and Tindahay series.  Feltham and Tindahay soils are deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Emberton soils are on terraces.  The slope ranges from 1 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in wind modified alluvium from mixed sources. Elevations are 3,500 to 4,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 10 inches.  The average annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost free season is 130 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Banbury, Harsan, Kecko, and Paulville soils.  Banbury soils occur on lower terraces, and are shallow to bedrock.  Harsan soils occur on the same landscape, are deep, and fine-loamy.  Kecko soils occur on higher terraces are deep, and coarse-loamy. Paulville soils occur on lower terraces, are deep, and fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Emberton soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is Indian ricegrass, needleandthread and basin big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Emberton soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.
