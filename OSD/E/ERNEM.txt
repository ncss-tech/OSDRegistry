ERNEM SERIES

The Ernem series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from consolidated sandstone.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ernem very stony loam, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky, plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; 10 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, 5 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 or 4 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very stony heavy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong very fine blocky; hard, friable, sticky, very plastic; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; many fine roots; many fine pores; 25 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt2--7 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony heavy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong very fine blocky; hard, friable, sticky, very plastic; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; many fine roots; many fine pores; 25 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt irregular boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 15 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very stony clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to very fine blocky; hard, friable, sticky, plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; 25 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles; common fine and medium soft masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    R--15 inches; indurated sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cascade County, Montana; 100 feet west and 10 feet south of the NE corner of sec. 36, T. 22 N., R. 1 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature:  42 to 47 degrees F. Mollic epipedon thickness:  7 to 14 inches Moisture control section:  approximately between the depths of 4 and 12 inches Control section:  35 to 50 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments Depth to Bk horizon:  9 to 18 inches Depth to bedrock:  10 to 20 inches Phases:  nonstony NOTE:  Mollic epipedon includes all or part of the Bt1 horizon.

A horizon - Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist Chroma:  2 or 3 Texture, less than 2 mm:  loam or clay loam Clay content:  15 to 40 percent Rock fragments:  5 to 60 percent - stones and cobbles, 0 to 40 percent; pebbles, 5 to 25 percent Reaction:  pH 6.6 to 7.8

Bt1 horizon - Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist Chroma:  2 or 3 Texture, less than 2 mm:  clay loam or clay Clay content:  35 to 50 percent Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent - stones and cobbles, 5 to 45 percent; pebbles, 5 to 35 percent Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4

Bt2 horizon - Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y Value:  5, 6, or 7 dry; 4 or 5 moist Chroma:  2 or 3 Texture, less than 2 mm:  clay loam or clay Clay content:  35 to 50 percent Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent - stones and cobbles, 5 to 45 percent; pebbles, 5 to 35 percent Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4 NOTE:  This horizon may be lacking in some profiles.

Bk horizon - Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y Value:  5, 6, or 7 dry; 4 or 5 moist Chroma:  2 or 3 Texture, less than 2 mm:  clay loam or clay Clay content:  35 to 50 percent Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent - stones and cobbles, 5 to 45 percent; pebbles, 5 to 35 percent Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Raton and Sinnigam series.  The Raton soils have formed in materials derived from basalt and have influence from ash, cinders, and other volcanic materials.  They have a neutral reaction throughout the profile and have 15 to 20 inches of precipitation.  The Sinnigam soils do not have a Bk horizon and are extremely stony in the Bt2 horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ernem soils are on uplands.  Elevations are 3,000 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in material derived from consolidated sandstone.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Ernem soils are used mainly as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, needleandthread, Sandberg bluegrass, and fringed sagewort

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ernem soils are of limited extent in north-central Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cascade County, Montana, 1975.
REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0037, MT0140.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from soil surface to 7 inches (A, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 3 to 12 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a lithic contact at 15 inches; a particle-size control section from 4 to 12 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).  Lithic Argiborolls feature a mollic epipedon more than 7 inches thick, an argillic horizon at least 3 inches thick, a lithic contact between 10 and 20 inches.  Ernem soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic and have a frigid temperature regime.
