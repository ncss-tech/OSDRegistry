EASTVAL SERIES


The Eastval series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Eastval soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aquinas, Boulflat, Cherry Spring, Spasprey, Yody, Zaidy and Zoda series.  

Aquinas, Boulflat, Cherry Spring, Spasprey, Yody, Zaidy and Zoda soils lack a subhorizon within the argillic horizon that has more than 35 percent clay.  In addition Boulflat, Cherry Springs, Spasprey, Yody, Zaidy and Zoda soils have carbonate accumulations above the duripan.  Boulflat and Deerlodge soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in their control section.  Cherry Springs soils have less than 35 percent sand in their argillic horizons.  Yody soils have less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Eastval soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,465 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Reno and Saralegui series.  Reno soils have an abrupt A-B boundary and have an indurated duripan.  Saralegui soils lack a duripan and do not have a Bt subhorizon with greater than 35 percent clay.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; index surface runoff is high or very high; very low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Eastval soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, bottlebrush squirreltail and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
