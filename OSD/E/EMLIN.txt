EMLIN SERIES

The Emlin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium derived from limestone, quartzite and sandstone. Emlin soils are on piedmont slopes, structural benches, mountains, plateaus, and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Colorado and northeastern Utah; LRR E, MLRA 47 in Utah and LRR D, MLRA 34 in Colorado.  This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Moffat county, Colorado, Moffat County soil survey area, 1991.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 11 to 19 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 11 inches. (A1, A2, and AB horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 11 to 19 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 19 to 60 inches. (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)

Remarks: This soil was proposed in Teton County, Montana. The type location was moved to Moffat County, Colorado, in 1985.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

The classification was changed from Aridic Argiborolls to frigid Calcidic Argiustolls 12/98.
