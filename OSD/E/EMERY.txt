EMERY SERIES

The Emery series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on concave backslopes and sideslopes on dissected till plains.  They formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy pedisediments which overlie a strongly weathered paleosol in the Pre-Illinoian till.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).

Atterberry and Bethalto soils average less than 8 percent sand in the lower part of the control section.  Canoe soils have a sand content more than 8 percent in the upper half of the series control section. Curran soils have a sand content of  of more than 70 percent in the lower third of the series control section.

Mulvey soils have more than 14 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section.  Wauconda soils have free carbonates above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Emery soils are on concave backslopes and side slopes on till plains.  Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Emery soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess and the underlying silty and loamy pedisediments.  The loess is late-Wisconsinan Peoria loess, and the underlying silty or loamy water-worked sediments are early-Wisconsinan Roxana silt and Cretacious sediments.  Emery soils are underlain at a depth of about 2.1 to 3 meters (7 to 10 feet) by a strongly weathered paleosol in the Pre-Illinoian till.  They are formed in areas of transition between prairie grass and deciduous forest.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 yo 13.9 degrees C (46 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1143 mm (29 to 45 inches), frost free days ranges from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 feet to 1020 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atterberry, Blair, Clarksdale, Downs, El Dara, Fishhook, Ipava, Keller, Keomah, and Rozetta soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Atterberry and Clarksdale soils are on similar nearby landform positions and average less than 8 percent sand in the series control section.  Blair and El Dara soils are downslope.  They have a thinner loess mantle and average more than 25 percent sand in the control section.  Fishhook and Keller soils are on similar landform positions and contain more than 35 percent clay in the lower one-half of the control section, and formed partly in Sangamon paleosols.  The moderately well drained Downs and Rozetta soils are on similar and more sloping landform positions. Ipava and Keomah soils are on nearby summits and form a biosequence with Emery soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. Surface runoff is medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate.  The seasonal high water table is 15 cm to 46 cm (0.5 foot to 1.5 feet) below the surface in spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are used to grow corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay.  Natural vegetation is grass and deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 108B and 115C in central and western Illinois. Extent is small.
