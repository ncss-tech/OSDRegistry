ESCRITO SERIES

The Escrito series consists of shallow, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability overlying very slowly permeable sandstone bedrock. This soil formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. Escrito soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 3 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 cm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Escrito very fine sandy loam, on a west facing, planar 5 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 2,500 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 25, 1989 the soil was dry throughout.

    Oi--0 to 1 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter.  (0 to 3 cm thick)

    A1--1 to 3 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine vesicular pores; 5 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear smooth boundary.  

    A2--3 to 15 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of A1, A2 - 4 to 18 cm)

    Bw--15 to 41 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, common fine medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    R--41 cm; sandstone bedrock

Present in some pedons
Cr layer, 3 to 8 cm thick, overlying the R layer

COMPETING SERIES: 
Modo (UT) - have pH reactions greater than 7.3 (alkaline) throughout
Stout (NM) - are wetter in April through June

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - hillslopes, mountain slopes
Elevation - 2,100 to 2,620 meters
Slopes - 3 to 55 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale
Mean annual air temperature - 5.5 to 7.2 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation - 406 to 508 cm
Precipitation pattern - Precipitation falls mostly during the months of November through March and July through October. June is the driest month. Total snowfall averages about 1.2 to 1.5 meters with snowmelt lasting into April.
Frost-free period - 80 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing, commercial woodland, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is ponderosa pine with an understory of Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, pine dropseed, and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern New Mexico and southern Colorado; LRR D and E; MLRA 36 and 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, Jicarilla Apache Reservation, Parts of Rio Arriba and Sandoval Counties Soil Survey, 2000. The name is taken from a local canyon.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Cambic horizon: 15 to 41 cm (Bw horizon)
Lithic contact: 41 cm to hard sandstone bedrock (R layer)
Particle-size control section: 25 to 41 cm (part of the Bw horizon) 
Series control section: 0 to 41 cm (A1, A2, Bw horizons)

Escrito soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.
