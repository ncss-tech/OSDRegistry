EPITAPH SERIES

The Epitaph series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt.  Epitaph soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, thermic Petrocalcic Calcitorrerts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Epitaph very cobbly clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 40 to 50 percent of the surface is covered with gravel and cobble.

    A--0 to 1 inch; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very cobbly clay loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common vertical cracks .25 to 1 inch wide; 15 percent gravel and 30 percent cobble; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt--1 to 6 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) moist; weak medium wedge shaped peds parting to strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots and few medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; common vertical cracks .25 to 1 inch wide; common distinct clay films on ped faces and lining pores; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Btss--6 to 27 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) moist; weak medium wedge shaped peds parting to strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces and lining pores; few intersecting slickensides; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    2Bkm--27 to 38 inches; indurated hardpan; extremely hard, cemented by calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    3R--38 inches; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Epitaph soils are on hills and volcanic flows at elevations of 3,800 to 4,900 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from basalt, cinders, bombs and volcanic rock.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lampshire and Graham soils.  These soils are shallow or very shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists of sideoats grama, plains lovegrass, blue and black grama, curlymesquite, cane beardgrass, and shrubby buckwheat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  The soils are of limited extent.  MLRA is 41.  Name derived from the historical Tombstone Epitaph newspaper.
