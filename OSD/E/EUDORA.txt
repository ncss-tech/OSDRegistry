EUDORA SERIES

 The Eudora series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty or loamy alluvium. These soils are on flood plain steps. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Eudora silt loam-in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 7 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--7 to 14 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (10 to 24 inches thick)

 C1--14 to 40 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.
 (0 to 40 inches thick)

 C2--40 to 48 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 24 inches thick)

 C3--48 to 80 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Johnson County, Kansas; 2 miles east and 1/2 mile south of Bonner Springs; 200 feet north of center, sec. 34, T. 11 S., R. 23 E. USGS Topographic quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 3 minutes 8 seconds N and long. 94 degrees 50 minutes 58 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blyburg series. Blyburg soils contain free
carbonates within a depth of 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: coarse silty alluvium
Landform:  flood plain step
Flooding: occasional to rare
Duration: brief
Slopes:  0 to 2 percent
Elevation:  780 to 1070 feet
Mean annual temperature: 52 to 55 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 34 to 40 inches 
Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is 4 to 12 inches; udic moisture regime.
Precipitation pattern: udic
Frost-free period: 170 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belvue, Bismarckgrove, Bourbonais, Kimo, Kiro, Stonehouse and Zeandale soils. 
The Belvue soils are coarse-silty and have carbonates below 20 inches.
The fine-silty Bismarckgrove soils are on similar and somewhat lower positions. 
The coarse-silty over sandy Bourbonais soils occur on similar landscape positions. 
The clayey over loamy Kimo soils are generally on lower positions. 
Kiro soils are fine textured and in depressions.
The sandy textured Stonehouse soils are generally on somewhat higher positions. 
The Zeandale soils are coarse-silty and have carbonates throughout.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Well
Runoff: negligible to low 
Permeability: moderate 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Eudora soils are cultivated. Common cultivated crops are corn, grain, sorghum, soybeans, wheat, and alfalfa. Native vegetation is tall grasses and a few deciduous trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR M; MLRA 106; North-central and northeastern Kansas, Missouri along the length of the Missouri River, and southeastern Nebraska. The soils of this series are of moderate extent.
