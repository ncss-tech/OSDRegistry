EXIRA SERIES

The Exira series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on side slopes and head slopes on dissected till plains and risers on stream terraces.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches) (A, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons).
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (59 inches) (Ap, A, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, BC, and C horizons).
Mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches) (Ap, and A horizons).
Cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 107 centimeters (11 to 42 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons).
Udic moisture regime.

The gray colors and redoximorphic features are relict features related to a previous deoxidized and leached geological weathering zone. These colors are not indicative of present drainage conditions. These features were not considered in the classification of these soils.

Depth to relict gray colors decrease with increasing gradient on convex slopes.
