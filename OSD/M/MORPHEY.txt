MORPHEY SERIES

The Morphey series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from lacustrine sediments.  Morphey soils are on dissected stream terraces.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, frigid Xerertic Argialbolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Morphey silt loam -- on a 3 percent, south-facing slope at 4,950 feet elevation in pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on August 25, 1988, the soil was dry from 0 to 19 inches and moist below this depth.)

	A1--0 to 1 inch; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

	A2--1 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

	A3--4 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 10 to 15 inches)

	E--11 to 19 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots, many very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint redox concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

	Bt--19 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots, many very fine and fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

	Btkz--27 to 38 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; common filaments of lime and other soluble salts; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

	Bkz--38 to 55 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong fine and medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine tubular pores; filaments and splotches of lime and other soluble salts; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

	Bz--55 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong fine and medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine tubular pores; filaments and splotches of soluble salts; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cowsly and Wilkins series.  Cowsly and Wilkins soils lack secondary carbonates above 40 inches and lack a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Morphey soils are on dissected stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium from lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and dry in summer.   The average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches; average annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 75 to 100 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dawtonia, Pattee, Perreau, and Yearian soils.  Dawtonia soils are on foothills and have ochric epipedons and loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Pattee soils are on dissected stream terraces and have ochric epipedons and cambic horizons.  Perreau soils are on foothills and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Yearian soils are on valley flats and have aquic soil moisture regimes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Slow and medium runoff.   Very slow permeability.  A perched water table is at 1 to 2 feet from April to June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated hayland and pasture.  Natural vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-centrol Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
