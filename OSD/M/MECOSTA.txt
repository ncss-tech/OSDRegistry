MECOSTA SERIES

The Mecosta series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sand and gravel deposits. These soils are on outwash plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Mecosta sand, on a 1 percent slope in a pine plantation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 25 cm (10 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bw1--25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [13 to 56 cm (5 to 22 inches) thick]

 Bw2--38 to 51 cm (15 to 20 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) gravelly sand; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 36 cm (14 inches) thick]

 Bw3--51 to 56 cm (20 to 22 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine roots; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [2 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 2C1--56 to 84 cm (22 to 33 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; 50 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [0 to102 cm (40 inches) thick]

 2C2--84 to 152 cm (33 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; few very fine roots; 65 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Mecosta County, Michigan; about 5 miles south and 1 mile west of Big Rapids; 1,815 feet north and 230 feet west of center of sec. 15, T. 14 N., R. 10 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 inches)
Rock fragment content: 1 to 25 percent gravel in the upper part of the solum and 25 to 50 percent in the lower part
Particle-size control section: averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral in the solum

Ap horizon:
Value: 3 or 4, 6 dry
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: commonly sand, but the range includes loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand

A horizon, where present:
Thickness: (2 to 8 inches)
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: commonly sand, but the range includes loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 4 to 8
Texture: sand, coarse sand, or loamy sand, or their very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogs

2C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sand, or extremely gravelly coarse sand
Rock fragment content: 35 to 65 percent gravel
Reaction: commonly moderately alkaline but some pedons are neutral or slightly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bonaparte, Hinckley, Manchester, Multorpor, Otisville, Quonset, and Rikers series. Bonaparte soils compete closely on soil properties but are not commonly sand in the upper part of the series control section. Hinckley, Manchester, Otisville, and Quonset soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Multorpor soils receive more than 889 (35 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Rikers soils contain carboliths in the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mecosta soils are on outwash plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in calcareous sand and gravel. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 889 mm (28 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coloma, Covert, and Riverdale soils. Coloma soils lack a calcareous 2C horizon, and are on similar topographic positions as Mecosta soils. The moderately well drained Covert and somewhat poorly drained Riverdale soils are on lower positions than the Mecosta soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low depending on the slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in red pine plantations or idle grassland. Some areas are used for urban development. Native vegetation was oak, aspen, and maple forests.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 95A and 98 in central Michigan and central Wisconsin. The series is of moderate extent.
