MULGON SERIES

The Mulgon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium.  Mulgon soils are on mountains and alluvial fans along mountain fronts.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Washakie county, Wyoming, 1976. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 15 to 31 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 2 to 5 inches.  (A horizon)
Albic horizon:  The zone from 5 to 10 inches.  (E horizon)
Glossic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 17 inches.  (Bt/E horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 17 to 33 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)

Remarks:
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
Percent base saturation for assignment to the mollic subgroup is estimated.
Glossic horizon is assumed to exist based on the presence of the Bt/E but cannot be confirmed since the description lacks percentages of Bt vs. E.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil formally classified as Mollic Cryoboralfs prior to the 1996 Keys.  Classification according to the 1996 Keys was Glossic Cryoboralf, loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive.
