MIRASOL SERIES

The Mirasol series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to indurated or strongly cemented duripans. They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed from tuffaceous sandstone of Miocene age. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 594 mm (24 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic, shallow Typic Durustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Mirasol very gravelly sandy loam, on a north facing, 8 percent slope in rangeland; elevation is 162 meters (533 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(thickness of the A horizon is 5 to 20 cm [2 to 8 in]) 

 Bw--15 to 41 cm (6 to 16 in); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; about 45 percent noncalcareous sandstone fragments ranging in size from 3 to 13 cm (1 to 5 in) in diameter; about 5 percent calcrete fragments less than 8 cm (3 in) in diameter; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (thickness of the Bw horizon is 13 to 30 cm [5 to 12 in]) 

 Bkqm--41 to 48 cm (16 to 19 in); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) strongly cemented duripan, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; with plates 12 to 25 mm (1/4 to 1 in) thick that have patchy coating of calcium carbonate; extremely hard, extremely firm; many fine and medium roots matted on top of laminar cap; laminar cap is 6 to 12 mm (1/4 to 1/2 in) thick; many fine and very fine roots matted on top of laminar cap; violently effervescent along laminar cap; duripan material is noneffervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (thickness of the Bkqm horizon is 5 to 10 cm [2 to 4 in]) 

 Bqm--48 to 203 cm (19 to 80 in); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) srongly cemented duripan, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; few fine and medium roots along cracks and fractures; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (thickness of the Bqm horizon is 76 to 140 cm [60 to 71 in])
