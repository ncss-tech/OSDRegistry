MONOLAKE SERIES

The Monolake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and tuff breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Monolake soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy-skeletal, glassy, mesic Vitritorrandic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Monolake gravelly ashy sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is covered with 35 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 15 percent stones, and 5 percent boulders.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mono County, California; in the Bodie Hills about 2.9 kilometers southeast of Mount Biedeman; in a nonsectionized township; USGS Bodie 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 08 minutes 09.1 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 02 minutes 36.1 seconds W; WGS84 38.13585 latitude, -119.043369 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section during winter and spring; usually dry July through early October; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 41 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent;
Rock fragments: Averages 60 to 80 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles.  Lithology of rock fragments is volcanic rock such as andesite or andesitic tuff.

A horizons
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.

Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.
Volcanic glass content: 40 to 70 percent in coarse silt through fine sand fractions.

Bw horizons

Volcanic glass content: 30 to 50 percent in very fine sand and fine sand fractions.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Donica and Searscanyon series.

Donica and Searscanyon soils are very deep and greater than 152 cm to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monolake soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and tuff breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,700 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beartracker and Roadside soils.  Beartracker soils are shallow to lithic contacts and do not have cambic horizons.  Roadside soils are shallow to paralithic contacts and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Monolake soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, desert needlegrass, singleleaf pinyon, antelope bitterbrush, and Eriogonum sp.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, in the western part of the Great Basin.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
