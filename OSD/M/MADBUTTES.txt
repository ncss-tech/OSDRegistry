MADBUTTES SERIES

The Madbuttes series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 2540 millimeters (100 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st. This soil has a xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F). The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature is greater than 6 degrees C.  This soil has a frigid soil temperature regime.

Soil reaction: very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil profile. 

Base saturation: (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent 125 centimeters below the top of the argillic horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountain summits and upper mountain slopes with slopes of 9 to 50 percent.  They are on convex slope positions at elevations of 992 to 1646 meters (3254 to 5400 feet). These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2032 to 2794 millimeters (80 to 110 inches). Mean January temperature is about 3 degrees C (37 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F); and the mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F). The frost free period is about 75 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Laketwin series. The Laketwin soils are on convex slope positions and are loamy-skeletal with greater than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is white fir, grand fir, incense cedar and Douglas-fir with an understory of snowberry, whitethorn ceanothus and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. These soils are of small extent.

1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 29 centimeters (Oi, A1, A2 & A3 horizons)
2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 29 to 138 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, & Bt3 horizons)
3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 29 to 79 centimeters, averages 28 percent clay, by weight, and 30 percent gravel, by volume.
4. Palehumult feature:  clay decreases from 28 to 26 percent in the argillic, which is less than 20 percent or more (relative) from the maximum clay content.
