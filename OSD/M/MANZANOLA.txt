MANZANOLA SERIES

The Manzanola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial materials derived from sedimentary rock.  Manzanola soils are on fans, valley side slopes, drainageways, plains, and stream terraces.  Slope gradients are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Manzanola clay loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) light clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; calcareous; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    BA--5 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels and pores; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--8 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine angular blocky; slightly hard, friable, sticky, plastic; few faint continuous clay films on peds and in root channels and pores; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 24 inches thick)

    Btk--20 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few faint clay films on peds and in root channels and pores; secondary calcium carbonate masses; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk--30 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) light clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; calcium carbonate masses; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Crowley County, Colorado; 0.1 mile south of the east 1/4 corner of Sec. 7, T. 20 S., R. 55 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: moist in some part May and June and intermittently July and August. Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.
Mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F.  
Depth to uniformly calcareous material: commonly at the surface, but ranges from 0 to 10 inches and is not leached in the argillic horizon.  
Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  

Particle size control section:
Clay content: 35 to 50 percent
Sand content: 15 to 25 percent, with less than 15 fine or coarser sand
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above depth of 40 inches and are mainly 1/4 to 3 inches in diameter.

A horizon:
Hue:  5Y to 7.5YR

Reaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.

Bt and Btk horizons: 
Hue:  5Y to 7.5YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  1 to 6
Texture: clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay
Clay content: 35 to 50 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 15 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline, and nonsaline or slightly saline.

Bk horizon: 
Hue:  5Y to 7.5YR
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: of 2 to 4
Texture: clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or loam
Reaction: moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 35 percent  . Horizons exceeding 15 percent are typically below a depth of 40 inches.
It is nonsaline or slightly saline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aqua Fria, Arp, Bacid, Bessemer, Falfa, Mughouse, Rencalson, Renohill, Ulm, Winklo, and Wyarno series.  
Aqua Fria soils: have gravel and cobble at depths of 18 to 36 inches and have noncalcareous A and Bt horizons.  
Arp soils: are moderately deep to paralithic contact
Bacid soils: are leached in the upper part of the Bt horizon, from 8 to 20 inches deep
Bessemer soils: average greater than 35 percent rock fragments below the argillic horizon
Falfa soils: have hues of 2.5YR or redder in the argillic horizon
Mughouse soils: have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches
Rencalson soils: are moderately deep to paralithic contact
Renohill soils: are moderately deep to paralithic contact
Ulm soils: are noncalcareous to depths of 12 to 30 inches, have neutral or slightly alkaline Bt horizons
Winklo soils: are moderately deep to paralithic contact
Wyarno soils: are less than 10 inches thick to the base of the Bt horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: plains, alluvial fans, drainageways, valley side slopes, plains, or stream terraces.  
Slopes:  0 to 25 percent
Parent material: alluvial materials derived principally from sedimentary rock
Elevation: 3,600 to 6,000 feet
Mean annual precipitation: 11 to 15 inches, at the type location approximately 13 inches
    Wettest periods:  spring and early summer months.
Mean annual air temperature: 49 to 54 degrees F.
Frost free period: 110 to 165 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bacid series and the Limon series. Limon soils do not have an argillic horizon and are mapped below Manzanola soils on flood plains..

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to slow runoff; moderately slow to slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as rangeland and for nonirrigated and irrigated crops.  Native vegetation is principally blue grama, galleta, and western wheatgrass.  Dryland crops are principally wheat; alfalfa, small grains, wheat, and row crops that are grown under irrigation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Colorado; LRR G, MLRA 69.  The series is of large extent.
