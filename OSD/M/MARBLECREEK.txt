MARBLECREEK SERIES 

The Marblecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in material weathered from schist and quartzite bedrock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slope ranges from 15 to 80 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C and the average annual precipitation is about 950 mm.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pasturecreek series. 

Paturecreek (OR) - formed in volcanic ash and loess over colluvium from argillite, metavolcanic rocks or rhyolite

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marblecreek soils are on east, west, and south aspects of mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 80 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from schist and quartzite bedrock, with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Elevations range from 610 to 1585 meters.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.8 degrees C, and average annual precipitation is 750 to 1600 mm.  The average frost-free period is from 50 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackprince, Bouldercreek, Jacot, and Nakarna soils.  Blackprince soils are on south-facing foothills and have paralithic bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Bouldercreek soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and are ashy over loamy-skeletal.  Jacot soils are on north-facing foothills and are ashy over loamy.  Nakarna soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and are ashy over loamy. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the volcanic as mantle, and high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, western white pine, and ponderosa pine, with an understory of queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, myrtle pachystima, goldthread, common snowberry, piper anemone, Columbia brome, American trailplant, and sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  MLRA 43A. This soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Shoshone County, Idaho, 1993. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 cm (Oi, Oe and A horizons) 
Cambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 68 cm (Bw1 and 2Bw2 horizon) 
Volcanic ash mantle - the zone from 4 to 33 cm (A and Bw1 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 29 to 104 cm (part of the Bw1, 2Bw2, and part of the 2BC horizon)

10/2012 Marblecreek is reclassified from Dystrudepts to Eutrudepts great group.  This reflects the preponderance of lab data regarding base saturation in soils sampled on similar parent materials in the MLRA.
