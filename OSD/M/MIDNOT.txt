MIDNOT SERIES

The Midnot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium over residuum from semi-consolidated shale, siltstone or mudstone. These soils are on eroded fan remnants, eroded fan remnant side slopes, and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Midnot clay loam, in Rangeland on an 11 percent slope at an elevation of 1,430 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

       A--0 to 9 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate very fine platy and weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and coarse roots; common very fine and coarse irregular and tubular pores; 6 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 cm thick)                                        

       Bk1--9 to 23 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly silty clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and coarse roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 10 percent fine calcium carbonate masses on faces of peds; 18 percent gravel and 12 percent paragravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. 

       Bk2--23 to 43 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) gravelly silty clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular and irregular pores; 20 percent fine and medium calcium carbonate masses on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel and 15 percent paragravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bk horizons is 25 to 60 cm)                             

       BCk--43 to 78 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular and irregular pores; finely disseminated carbonates and 2 percent medium calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; 17 percent gravel and 20 percent paragravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 40 cm thick)            

       Cr--78 to 150 cm; moderately cemented, semi-consolidated cretaceous shale; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7)
