MAHOGANY SERIES

The Mahogany series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from black slate. These soils are on mountain slopes and scarp slopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 425 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1.0 degree C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Vertic Haplocryalfs

    Btk--46 to 92 cm; gray (5Y 5/1), clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1), moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; moderately hard, firm, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent fine irregular carbonate masses; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (40 to 60 cm thick)

    BCk--92 to 120 cm; gray (5Y 5/1), clay loam, very dark gray (5Y 3/1), moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 5 percent fine irregular carbonate masses; 5 percent channers; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (20 to 35 cm thick)

    R--120 cm; indurated black slate bedrock.
