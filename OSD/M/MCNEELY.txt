MCNEELY SERIES

The McNeely series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in sandy deposits of the Deweyville Formation of late-Pleistocene to early Holocene age.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  McNeely sand--woodland.(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm, (0 to 5 in); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; many very fine, medium, and few coarse roots; many fine and medium pores; 15 percent of the total volume is a mixture of very pale brown (10YR 7/4), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sand throughout; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 28 cm [3 to 11 in] thick)

    C1--13 to 56 cm, (5 to 22 in); brown (10YR 5/3) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; many very fine, medium, and few coarse roots; 15 percent coarse root channels filled with very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sand; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

    C2--56 to 94 cm, (22 to 37 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; many very fine, fine, and common medium roots; 2 percent fine light gray (10YR 7/1) clean sand masses along root channels; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  

    C3--94 to 114 cm, (37 to 45 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/4) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; 2 percent grayish brown burned out root channels; 1 percent fine and medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron stains with sharp boundaries on sand grains; 2 percent fine light gray (10YR 7/1) clean sand masses along root channels and in pores; strongly acid; diffuse wavy boundary.

    C4--114 to 183 cm, (45 to 72 in); very pale brown (10YR 8/3) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; common very fine, and few fine and medium roots; few thin brown (10YR 5/3) lamellae; 1 percent fine and medium prominent yellow (10YR 7/6) iron stains with sharp boundaries on sand grains; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary.  (combined thickness of the C layers is 175 to 196 cm [69 to 77 in])

    C5--183 to 203 cm, (72 to 80 in); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; few very fine roots; 1 percent prominent very pale brown (10YR 7/4) iron stains on sand grains; strongly acid.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  excessively drained.  Runoff is negligible.  Permeability is very rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for wildlife habitat.  Some areas are in timber production.  Native vegetation is sandjack and blackjack oak, longleaf pine, sweetgum, yaupon, highbush blueberry, bull nettle, horsemint, threeawns, panicums and bluestems.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods of southeast Texas and possibly Louisiana; LRR T; MLRA 152B; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hardin County, Texas; 1998.

REMARKS:  The McNeely soils were formerly included with the Tonkawa series.  It is named for McNeely Creek. The latitude and longitude was changed in 2011 because the original coordinates were not at the series type location. 
Horizon designation was changed to better reflect the entisols classification. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (A Horizon)

Coated feature: The fine-earth fraction contains 5 to 10 percent by weight silt plus clay.
