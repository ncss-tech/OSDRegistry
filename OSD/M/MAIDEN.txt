MAIDEN SERIES

The Maiden series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from limestone.  These soils are on are on sedimentary plains, escarpments, ridges, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maiden very gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; disseminated lime; few faint coatings of lime on undersides of fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.

    Ak--4 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 15 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; disseminated lime; common fine masses of light gray (10YR 7/2) lime; few faint lime coatings on surface of fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 4 to 8 inches.)

    Bk1--7 to 18 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 25 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; disseminated lime; many medium masses and threads of very pale brown (10YR 8/2) lime; common distinct lime casts on surface of fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2--18 to 26 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few to common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; disseminated lime; many medium masses and threads of very pale brown (10YR 8/2) lime; many prominent lime casts on surface of fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 15 to 25 inches.)

    R--26 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) hard limestone.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Maiden soils are used primarily for rangeland, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Western wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, rubber rabbitbrush, Rocky Mountain juniper, and black sagebrush.  Areas in woodland have an overstory of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, or limber pine and an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, and Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Maiden soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.  MLRAs 43B, 44B and 46.
