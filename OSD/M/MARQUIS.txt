MARQUIS SERIES

The Marquis series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters.

Tripoli--are at lower elevations in flat to concave drainageways and are frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest periods of normal years

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at a depth of 0.6 meter during April to June in normal years and both perched and apparent saturation can occur on this soil based on the season and intensity of rainfall during a given period of time
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10.0 micrometers per second in the silty or loamy sediments and 0.01 to 1.0 micrometers per second in the till
Surface runoff potential--negligible to medium

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A, Bw1, 2Bw2 and 2Bw3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A, Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, 2Bw4, and 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 137 centimeters (Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, and 2Bw4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on a zone of saturation within 100 centimeters for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years.
