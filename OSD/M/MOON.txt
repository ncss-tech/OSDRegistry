COMPETING SERIES: This is the Seward series. Seward soils have a densic contact within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moon soils are on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Moon soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of wind or water laid sandy material and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 466 meters (600 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aubbeenaubbee, Barry, Brookston, Chelsea, Crosier, Markton, Metea, Miami, Owosso, Plainfield, Rensselaer, Riddles, Selfridge, Spinks, and Wawasee soils. The somewhat poorly drained Aubbeenaubbee, Crosier, Markton, and Selfridge soils are on footslopes of glaciated uplands. The poorly drained Barry and Brookston soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Rensselaer soils are in depressions of glaciated uplands. The excessively drained Chelsea and Plainfield soils, and the well drained Spinks soils are on summits and backslopes of glaciated uplands and are sandier in the lower part of the series control section. The well drained Metea, Owosso, Riddles, and Wawasee soils, and the moderately well drained Miami soils are on summits and backslopes of glaciated uplands.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 107 cm (1.5 to 3.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy material and moderately high in the underlying loamy till. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy material and moderate or moderately slow in the underlying loamy till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are used for growing corn, hay, soybeans, and wheat. A few small areas are forested or used for pasture. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 155031 represents the typical pedon in complex with Metea soils in northern Indiana.
NASIS Data Mapunit ID 401788 represents Moon soils in complex with Williamstown soils in northern Indiana.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S98IN-131-012) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T98IN-131-096) for the typical pedon is on file in the MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 80 percent Moon and similar soils and 20 percent Metea and similar soils.
