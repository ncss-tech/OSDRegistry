MERCEDES SERIES

The Mercedes series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands of the South Texas Coastal Plain. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.

Harlingen, Texas USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 26 degrees, 12 minutes, 51 seconds N., Longitude: 97 degrees, 37 minutes, 59 seconds W.; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: An Ustic moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section (SMCS) is dry in some or all parts for more than 90, but less than 150 cumulative days in normal years.  The SMCS is also either moist in some or all parts for 180 cumulative days or more, or moist for 90 or more consecutive days in normal years.  November through April are the driest months, with a second low in July, while September is the wettest.

Solum thickness: 60 to more than 80 inches.
Slickensides: 10 to 30 inches below the surface.
Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR); 13 or more within 25 inches of the surface.
Soil salinity: nonsaline to moderately saline and increases with depth;  electrical conductivity is 1 to about 12 dS/m. 
Clay content of the particle size control section: 45 to 60 percent. 
Siliceous pebbles comprise 0 to about 10 percent of any horizon. 
The amplitude or waviness in the boundary between the A and B horizons is about 4 to 12 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arroyada (TX), Catarina (TX), Coquat (TX), Cotulla (TX), Duvert (TX), Lasalle (TX), Montell (TX), Victine (TX), and Victoria (TX) series in the same family.

Arroyada and Coquat soils: are somewhat poorly drained, have an ochric epipedon, and formed in Holocene alluvium on flood plains.
Catarina soils: have an ochric epipedon, and formed in clayey alluvium and colluvium derived from sediments of Eocene age. 
Cotulla soils: have an ochric epipedon, formed in thick beds of calcareous, saline, clayey sediments that are, in places, interbedded with shale and sandstone, and occur in areas with mean annual precipitation ranging from 19 to 26 inches.
Duvert soils: have an ochric epipedon and a paralithic contact within 20 to 40 inches of the soil surface.
Lasalle soils: have an ochric epipedon, and have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the B horizons.
Montell soils: have an ochric epipedon and a gypsic horizon.
Victoria and Victine soils: Victoria soils are well drained and depth to SAR of more than 13 ranges from 28 to 39 inches.  Victine soils are somewhat poorly drained and have higher SAR in the upper 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Harlingen, Hidalgo, Lozano, Lyford, Racombes, Raymondville, and Tiocano series.

Harlingen soils: have moist chromas of 1.5 or more in some part of the upper 12 inches in more than half of each pedon and   are on a slightly higher landform.
Hidalgo soils: are in a fine-loamy particle size family, have a calcic horizon within 40 inches and are on a higher landform.
Lozano and Lyford soils: are in a fine-loamy particle size family, have an ochric epipedon, and are on a higher landform.
Racombes soils: are in a fine-loamy particle size family, have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick, and are on a higher landform.
Raymondville soils: have calcic horizons at depths of less than 40 inches and do not have gilgai microrelief.
Tiocano soils: are in depressions and have cracks that remain open less than 150 days in most years.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly irrigated cropland.  Cotton and grain sorghum are the major crops.  Few small areas are in rangeland and wildlife habitat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lower Rio Grande Plain, Texas; Land Resource Region I-Southwest Plateaus and Plains; MLRA 83D; the series is moderate in extent.
