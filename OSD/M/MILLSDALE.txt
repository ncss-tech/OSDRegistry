MILLSDALE SERIES

The Millsdale series consists of moderately deep, very poorly drained soils formed in till overlying limestone or dolostone. They are on till plains, lake plains, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Pewamo series. Pewamo soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Millsdale soils are on till plains, lake plains, and low terraces of late Wisconsin age. In some areas, they are on monadnocks on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Millsdale soils formed in till overlying limestone or dolostone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Milton soils and the somewhat poorly drained Randolph soils that form a toposequence with the Millsdale soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas are used as permanent pasture or as woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, primarily ash, beech, elm, and maple, or was wet prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Millsdale soils occur primarily in MLRA 111B in western and central Ohio and in central and northern Indiana, and to a lesser extent in MLRA 99 in northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan and in MLRAs 108A and 110 in northern Illinois. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Will County, Illinois, 1912.

REMARKS: In the past, Millsdale soils have ranged to include soils that are outside the current concept represented by the type location description. In Illinois, soils lacking argillic horizons have been included in the series; in Indiana, the series has ranged to include soils that are in the fine-loamy particle-size family.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 89 cm (Btg horizon).
Lithic contact: at 89 cm (top of the 2R layer).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in lower part of the mollic epipedon and throughout the argillic horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for HK-40, the previous typical pedon.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 130016 in MO 11.
