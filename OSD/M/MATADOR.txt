MATADOR SERIES

The Matador series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in coarse-loamy, gypsiferous alluvium and coarse-loamy gypsiferous eolian deposits. These nearly level soils are on drainageways and small coalescent fans within drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Matador soils are on drainages and small coalescent fans on drainages. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed from coarse-loamy, gypsiferous alluvium and coarse-loamy gypsiferous eolian deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,970 to 4,280 ft. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bomber, Corvus, Nasa, Tornado and Yesum soils. Bomber soils are non salic and are in drainages. Corvus soils have petrogypsic horizons between 5 and 20 inches and are on relict dunes and fan piedmonts. Tornado soils are greater than 40 percent clay in the particle size control section, have mixed mineralogy and are in drainages. Nasa soils have petrogypsic horizons between 20 and 40 inches and are on fan piedmonts. Tornado soils are greater than 40 percent clay in the particle size control section, have mixed mineralogy and are in drainages. Yesum soils have a gypsic horizon within 7 inches from the surface (Leptic) and are on fan piedmonts.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff very low; moderate to rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military activities and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is fourwing saltbush, iodine bush and seepweed. The ecological site is Salt Flat (R042XB036NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin and surrounding piedmonts. MLRA 42-2. Limited extent.
