MARMOT SERIES

The Marmot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and till over residuum derived from metamorphic rock. The Marmot soils are on structural benches of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bindle (MLRA 6) and the Mineralking soils. Bindle soils have mafic volcanic bedrock between 50 and 100 cm, and are dry for less than 80 days. Mineralking soils do not have a lithic contact within 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Marmot soils are on convex backslopes of structural benches on glacial-valley walls. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and till over residuum derived from metasedimentary and metavolcanic rock. Elevation is 1825 to 3175 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 730 to 1180 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 2 to 9 degrees C. The frost free season is 65 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Mineralking soils. The Mineralking soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes and do not have a lithic contact within 150 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is Sierra juniper, Jeffrey pine, greenleaf manzanita, mountain big sagebrush, oceanspray, and threadleaf sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
