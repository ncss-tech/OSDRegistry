MONTEOLA SERIES

The Monteola series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in clays and clays interbedded with sandstone and claystone of the Oakville and Fleming Formation. These gently to moderately sloping soils occur on hillslopes on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).

Clareville soils; have a loamy surface and occur in draws of hills
Coy soils: have a loamy surface and occur on similar landforms
Pernitas and Weesatche soils: are loamy throughout and occur on similar landforms

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is very slow.  Runoff is high on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on slopes greater than 1 percent. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is cracked and dry and very slowly when it is moist.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Monteola soils are in cropland and are used for cotton and grain sorghums.  Principal native plants are mesquite, spiny hackberry, catclaw, and agarito.  Native grasses are buffalograss, curlymesquite grass, and alkali sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern, Central, and Western Rio Grande Plains (MLRA 83A); LRR I. The series is of large extent.
