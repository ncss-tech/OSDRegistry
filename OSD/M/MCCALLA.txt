MCCALLA SERIES

The McCalla series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on inset fans and in drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: McCalla loam, in irrigated hayland on 1 percent slope at 1,100 meters elevation (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 36 cm; black (10YR 2/1) moist, cobbly loam; dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable, hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 5 percent medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) moist redox concentrations; 5 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 38 cm thick)

    Bw--36 to 56 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist, very cobbly loam; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common medium irregular pores; 20 percent medium prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) moist redox concentrations; 15 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 32 cm thick)

    C1--56 to 81 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist, very cobbly sandy loam; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; common medium irregular pores; 40 percent medium prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) moist redox concentrations; 25 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--81 to 152 cm; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist, very gravelly loamy sand; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many medium irregular pores; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).
