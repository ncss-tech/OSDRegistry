MARFA SERIES

The Marfa series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium derived from Tascotal tuffaceous sandstone, Perdiz igneous conglomerate, and eolian material.  Marfa soils are on valley floors and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Argiustolls

NAD83;  UTM coordinates 593298 m E, 3354564 m N, Zone 13.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Moisture - Usually dry in some or all parts for sixth tenth or more of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Some part of the epipedon is moist for more than 90 cumulative days in most years when the soil temperature exceed 41 degrees F. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 62 to 69 degrees F.

Solum thickness ranges from - 60 inches to greater than 80 inches in the majority of pedons. 

Thickness of mollic epipedon - 0 to 41 inches

Particle size control section - Clay content: 35 to 55 percent 

Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  

Coarse fragments in the solum: less than 5 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abilene (TX), Blanket (TX), McLain (OK), and Roark (OK)(T)series. 

Abilene, Blanket, Roark, and Mclain soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods and the precipitation ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  

Abilene soils contain 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonates. 

Blanket soils have secondary carbonates above 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Marfa soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils on valley floors and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils developed in loamy and clayey alluvium derived from Tascotal tuffaceous sandstone, Perdiz igneous conglomerate, and eolian material.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches, occurring mainly during May through October. Run off from adjacent mountains, noncalcareous felsic parent material, and a relatively stable landscape contribute to the development of an argillic horizon.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 180 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,695 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Musquiz, Murray, Phantom, Fort Russell (T), and Eppenauer series.  Musquiz and Murray soils have mollic epipedons that are less than 20 inches deep. In addition Murray soils contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Phantom soils have mollic epipedon less than 20 inches deep and do not have an argillic horizon.  Fort Russell soils are coarse-loamy and shallow to a paralithic contact.  Eppenauer soils are fine loamy and moderately deep to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is low. This soil receives additional run on moisture from higher adjacent areas.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major use is livestock grazing. Vegetation is of the mixed prairie type consisting of blue grama, cane bluestem, sideoats grama, perennial threeawn, plains bristlegrass, and buffalo grass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Texas. MLRA 42. The series is of moderate extent.
