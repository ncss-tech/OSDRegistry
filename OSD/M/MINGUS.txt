MINGUS SERIES

The Mingus series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well drained soils formed in mixed fan alluvium.  Mingus soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Abruptic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mingus extremely gravelly clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 70 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

   Bt--3 to 12 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; common pressure faces; 20 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick)

    Btk--12 to 24 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; few fine calcium carbonate threads and soft masses; few faint clay films on ped faces; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (12 to 18 inches thick)

    2Bkqm1--24 to 30 inches; pinkish white (5YR 8/2) indurated silica and calcium carbonate cemented hardpan with thin laminar surface, pink (7.5YR 8/4) moist; massive; extremely hard; violently effervescent; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bkqm2--30 to 70 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) calcium carbonate cemented sand, gravel and cobble, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard; about 80 to 85 percent gravel and cobble; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Yavapai County, Arizona; located about 725 feet north and 605 feet east of the SW corner Section 10, T. 15 N., R. 3 E.; Latitude 34 degrees 42 minutes 18.7 seconds N, Longitude 112 degrees 01 minute 30.6 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  The epipedon is moist in some part less than 90 days (cumulative) when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. in 7 out of 10 years.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature - 62 to 65 degrees F.

Clay content - Averages 30 to 55 percent in the particle-size control section

Rock fragments - Averages 5 to 25 percent in the particle-size control section

Depth to duripan - 20 to 40 inches

Organic matter content - Less than 1 percent in the surface

Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mingus soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,900 to 5,000 feet.  They formed in fan alluvium from basalt, ash and tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tapco and White House soils.  White House soils do not have a duripan.  Tapco soils have a duripan at depths less than 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and home sites.  Vegetation is tobosa, prickly pear, mesquite, catclaw acacia, turpentinebush and annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Arizona.  The Mingus soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA is 38.
