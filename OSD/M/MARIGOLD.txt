MARIGOLD SERIES

The Marigold series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  These soils are on pediments. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Inceptic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Marigold loam. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, non-plastic; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--4 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, friable, sticky, plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bk1--9 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky, slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    Bk2--13 to 35 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, non-plastic; strongly effervescent; common fine calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk3--35 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, non-plastic; strongly effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline.  (combined thickness of the Bk horizons: 44 to 53 inches)

TYPE LOCATION:  Fremont County, Colorado; located about 2,200 feet south and 600 feet east of the northwest corner of section 22, T. 16 S., R. 70 W.; 4276810m N., 480900m E., Zone 13; lat. 39 degrees 38 minutes 30 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees 13 minutes 12 seconds W., NAD 1983.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium
Landform:  pediments
Slopes:  3 to 15 percent
Elevation:  6600 to 7500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  42 to 47 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 16 inches
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period:  80 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cathedral and Pendant series.  The Cathedral soils are shallow and are on mountains.  The Pendant soils are shallow and are on pediments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing.  Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, blue grama, prairie junegrass, needleandthread, little bluestem, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Teller-Park soil survey area, 2010. The typical pedon is in the Fremont County Area, Colorado. The name is from an old townsite in Teller County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 4 to 9 inches. (Bt horizon)
Ochric epipedon: from 0 to 4 inches. (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: from 4 to 9 inches. (Bt horizon)
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulation: from 9 to 60 inches. (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)

This series was developed to replace the Fort Collins Variant soil that was correlated in Fremont County.

The 2/2006 revision changes the subgroup classification from Typic to Inceptic.
