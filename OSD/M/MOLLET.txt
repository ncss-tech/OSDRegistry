MOLLET SERIES

The Mollet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from fine grained igneous rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mollet loam, 4 to 15 percent slopes, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--7 to 12 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 7 to 16 inches.)

    Bt1--12 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--16 to 29 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine, few fine and medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 10 to 26 inches thick)

    Bt3--29 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, few fine and medium tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.
