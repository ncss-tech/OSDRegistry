MEAUFUN SERIES

The Meaufun series consists of deep, well drained soils on backslopes of mountains.  Meaufun soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium overlying clay-producing tuffs or olivine basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Meaufun ashy loam - woodland, on a 28 percent southwest-facing slope at an elevation of 3,980 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Andic soil materials are apparent field textures.)

  Oi--0 to 1 inches; slightly decomposed twigs and needles.

  A--1 to 14 inches; black (7.5YR 2.5/1) ashy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots throughout; common very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 14 inches thick)

  E--14 to 19 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots throughout; common very fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.
