MILLPOCKET SERIES

The Millpocket series consists of very deep, well drained, sodium affected soils on lake plains and terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  Slope is 2 to 8 percent.  Elevation is 2,800 to 3,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.
