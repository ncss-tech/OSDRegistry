MILLPOCKET SERIES

The Millpocket series consists of very deep, well drained, sodium affected soils on lake plains and terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  Slope is 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Typic Natrixeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Millpocket silty clay loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; undecomposed and partially decomposed forest litter.

    E--3 to 21 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many fine and medium and few coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    E/Bt--21 to 31 cm; E part (60 percent) is light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; Bt part (40 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silty clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine and common medium tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.
