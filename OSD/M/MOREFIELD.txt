MOREFIELD SERIES

The Morefield series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone.  Morefield soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Morefield loam, on a south facing, 1 percent slope in pinyon-juniper woodland at an elevation of 6,840 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.   (1 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 8 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots throughout; common very fine discontinuous tubular pores; clay bridging between sand grains; neutral (pH 6.8) abrupt smooth boundary.   (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--8 to 12 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; common very fine discontinuous tubular pores; clay bridging between sand grains; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.   (2 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt3--12 to 24 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; clay bridging between sand grains; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.   (0 to 18 inches thick)

    Btk1--24 to 58 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; many faint continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common fine irregular carbonate threads; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.   (10 to 40 inches thick)

    Btk2--58 to 67 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots throughout; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; many faint continuous clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few fine irregular carbonate threads; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)
