MASCARENAS SERIES

The Mascarenas series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Mascarenas soils are on sides of mountains and have slopes of 15 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Palecryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mascarenas cobbly sandy loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0i--3 inches to 0; forest litter in various stages of decomposition.

    A--0 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, friable; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; 15 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    E--4 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; very weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granules; soft, friable, slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear irregular boundary.  (25 to 35 inches thick)

    Bt1--30 to 58 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy clay, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; tongues of very pale brown E material in the upper part; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and on rock fragments; few very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; 50 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (25 to 35 inches thick)

    Bt2--58 to 70 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely stony heavy sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many moderately thick clay films on rock fragments; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 30 percent stones; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Taos County, New Mexico; SE1/4 SE1/4 section 12, T.23N., R.13E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 30 to 40 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The solum is more than 60 inches thick.  Rock fragments are angular pebbles, cobbles, or stones of sandstone.  The solum is neutral or slightly alkaline.

A horizon:
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3
Texture (fine earth):  sandy loam or loam
Rock fragment content:  20 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles

E horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture (fine earth):  sandy loam or loam
Rock fragment content:  20 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles

Bt horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist
Texture (fine earth):  sandy clay, sandy clay loam, or clay
Rock fragment content:  30 to 80 percent gravel, 10 to 15 percent cobbles, 5 to 30 percent stones

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Diamante series.  Diamante soils have a frigid temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mascarenas soils are on strongly sloping to steep, smooth mountain slopes at elevations of 9,000 to 11,000 feet.  These soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and shales of the Pennsylvania Formation.  Precipitation is 25 to 40 inches per year and comes as winter snow and rain and late summer rain.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F., and average summer soil temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost free season is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Angostura, Derecho, Jaroso and Maes soils.  All these soils have argillic horizons at depths of less than 24 inches.  Also Angostura soils are loamy, skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The Mascarenas soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation and watershed.  Vegetation is Douglas fir, Engelmann spruce, white fir, aspen, some kinnickkinnick, whortleberry, and a few grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern New Mexico.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  The tonguing of the E horizon into the Bt1 horizon needs to be studied more thoroughly.
