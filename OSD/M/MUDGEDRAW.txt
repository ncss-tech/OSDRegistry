MUDGEDRAW SERIES

The Mudgedraw series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in slope alluvium derived from limestone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on footslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kerr County, Texas, 2017, Kerr County soil survey area, Texas, 2017. The name is from a USGS topographic quadrangle name Mudge Draw, Texas.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Barbarosa series. The series was separated based on the presence of slickensides.

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 89 cm (0 to 35 in). (A, Bss1, and Bss2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 14 to 120 cm (5.5 to 47.2 in). (Btss1, Btss2, and Btss3 horizons) 
Slickensides: 15 to 119 cm (6 to 47 in). (Bss1, Bss2, and Bss3 horizons)
