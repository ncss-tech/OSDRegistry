MANTEO SERIES

Soils of the Manteo series are shallow and somewhat excessively drained.  They formed in material weathered from very strongly acid serecite schist.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, thermic Lithic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Manteo channery silt loam - in a hardwood woodland.  (Colors are for moist soil.)

    Oi--0 to 3 inch; loose leave, twigs of deciduous trees, black (10YR 2/1) and very dark gray (10YR 3/1) slightly decomposed organic matter.

    A--3 to 4 inch; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) channery silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 25 percent channers; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    AB--4 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) channery silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 35 percent channers; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 18 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; 65 percent channers; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

    R--18 inches; serecite schist; partly fragmented, but hard; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Orange County, Virginia; 100 yards south of junction of VA-612 and VA-631, west of Church Run bridge.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments of schist with some quartz, slate or granite, range from 3 to 60 percent in the A and E horizons and from 35 to 80 percent in the Bw and C horizons.  Finely divided flakes of mica are common in some pedons.  Reaction in the solum ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid unless limed.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4.  The Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 6.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.

The AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 6.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.

The Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam or clay loam.

The C horizon, where present, is multicolored silt loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Pickens series is the only series in the same family.  Pickens soils have rock fragments of shale.

The Bremo, Briery, Catlett, Goldston, Hazel, Klinesville, Lousia, Louisburg, Manor, Mt. Airy, Sherando, Watt and Weikert series are in related families.  Bremo, Briery, Goldston, Hazel, Louisburg, Manor, Mt.  Airy, Sherando and Watt soils are deeper than 20 inches to bedrock.  Catlett, Klinesville and Weikert soils have temperature less than 59 degrees F.  Louisa soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Manteo soils typically are in gently sloping to very steep uplands.  Slopes are irregular with gradients typically between 10 to 35 percent but ranging from about 2 to 60 percent.  The soils developed in materials weathered from brown, pink, yellow, and reddish yellow very strongly acid serecite schist.  Rock outcrops of quartz are in some areas and granite in others.  Many rounded quartz gravel, which are remnants of old alluvial deposits, are on the surface in a few areas.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degree F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Badin, Gerorgeville, Lignum, Nason, Tatum, and York series.  All of these soils have argillic horizons, are non-skeletal, and are deeper to a lithic contact than Manteo.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained with high surface runoff and moderate rapid internal drainage.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Approximately 90 to 95 percent is used for woodland.  The remainder is used for pasture and crops.  Corn, small grain, and hay are the principal crops grown.  Vegetation consists of chestnut, scarlet, and white oaks, hickory, Virginia pine, dogwood, sourwood, and shortleaf pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and North Central portion of Piedmont Plateau in Virginia; small areas in North Carolina, South Carolina, and possibly Georgia and Alabama.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Culpeper County, Virginia, 1943.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic Horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric Epipedon :  the zone from 0 to 9 inches (A and AB horizons)
Cambic Horizon:  the zone between 9 and 18 inches (Bw horizon).
Lithic contact:  Hard bedrock at 18 inches.
Soil horizon depths were modified 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.
