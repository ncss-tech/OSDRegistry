MESQUITO SERIES

The Mesquito series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on narrow flood plains of a lava plateau.  These soils formed in alluvium from pumice over colluvium from basalt.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy-skeletal, glassy, nonacid Typic Cryaquands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mesquito supporting the ponderosa pine/common snowberry-flood plain plant association (CPS5-11) on a 6 percent slope with southwest aspect at 4665 feet.  When described on 7 September 1999 the soil was moist from 0 to 20 inches and wet from 20 to 30 inches (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

	A--0 to 1 inch; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) mucky ashy sandy loam, black (7.5YR 2.5/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; trace stones and boulders; few fine distinct black (2.5Y 2.5/1) manganese masses in matrix, faint black (2.5Y 2.5/1) moist; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1/2  to 4 inches thick)

	Ac1--1 to 10 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) paragravelly ashy sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, non-sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent paragravel, trace cobbles, 5 percent stones and boulders; common fine distinct black (2.5Y 2.5/1) manganese nodules and masses in matrix, faint black (2.5Y 2.5/1) moist; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 10 inches thick)

	Ac2--10 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very paragravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, non-sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots, few coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent paragravel, trace cobbles and 10 percent stones and boulders; common fine and medium distinct brown (7.5YR 4/3) iron-manganese nodules in matrix, faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; common fine prominent black (2.5Y 2.5/1) manganese nodules in matrix, faint black (2.5Y 2.5/1) moist; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron masses in matrix, absent moist and freshly exposed, prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) dried and remoistened; slightly acid (pH 6.4).  (4 to 20 inches thick)

	2Ac3--16 to 30 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely stony ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; common very fine roots, few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 40 percent stones and boulders; common fine and medium brown (7.5YR 4/3) iron-manganese nodules in matrix, distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; many fine prominent black (2.5Y 2.5/1) manganese nodules in matrix, faint black (2.5Y 2.5/1) moist; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron masses in matrix, absent moist and freshly exposed, prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) dried and remoistened; slightly acid (pH 6.4).  Based on landscape position and parent material, it is assumed this horizon extends to a depth of over 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - poorly drained

Permeability - moderately slow

Runoff - high

Flooding - frequent with long duration

Ponding - none

Water table - an apparent water table is at its uppermost limit from February to July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mesquito soils are used for wildlife habitat, watershed and recreation.  The potential natural plant community is the ponderosa pine/common snowberry-floodplain plant association (CPS5-11). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Klamath County, Oregon; MLRA 6.  Series is of small extent.
