MERKLEY SERIES

The Merkley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and mixed alluvium. They are on stream terraces. Permeability is moderate. Merkley soils have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Iphil series. Iphil soils are well drained with no redox features above 60 inches, and do not have a discontinuity in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Merkley soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 5,800 to 6,200 feet. The soil formed in loess and mixed alluvium. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, average annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F., the frost free period is 65 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Iphil (T) soil and the  Lago (T) and  Ream (T) soils. Lago soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections and are somewhat poorly drained. Ream soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and very gravelly to extremely gravelly substratums. Iphil soils are on loess covered uplands and terraces above Merkley soils. Lago soils are on silty alluvium covered flood plains lower on the landscape than Merkley soils. Ream soils are on similar landscapes as Merkley, but are on concave slopes when associated with Merkley soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Merkley soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland and hayland and pastureland. Typical crops consist of small grains. The potential native vegetation is Basin big sagebrush and mixed grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The soils of this series are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Franklin County, Idaho, 1997.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (the Ap1 and Ap2 horizons).

Calcic horizon - the zone from 12 to 36 inches (the Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 12 inches to 40 inches (part of the Ap2, the Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 and the Bk4 horizons. The particle-size control section will be 10 to 40 inches in pedons where the Ap horizon is 10 inches or less thick.)
