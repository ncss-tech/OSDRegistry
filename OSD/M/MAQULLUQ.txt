TYPE LOCATION: Western Interior Rivers Area, Alaska; UTM north 6846829 and UTM east 593265, zone 4.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture regime: udic
Mean annual soil temperature: * to * degrees F, * C.

Depth to sandy-skeletal material: 20 to 40 inches, 51 to 102 cm 

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 5; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: moderately decomposed plant material or slightly decomposed plant material
Reaction class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

E horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 1 or 2
Texture: Hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 1 or 2
Reaction class: very strongly acid or strongly acid

Bs horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 10R to 7.5YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: very strongly acid or strongly acid

BC horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

2C horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: fine sand, gravelly loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand 
Coarse fragments: 0 to 20 percent gravel
Reaction class: moderately acid or slightly acid

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Clarena series. Clarena series have stratified textures in the solum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: well drained
Landforms: sand sheets and terraces
Parent material: coarse-loamy eolian deposits over eolian sands
Elevation: 50 to 75 m
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Annual precipitation: 383 to 448 mm
Annual temperature: -2 to -1 degrees C
Frost-free period: 95 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ulesqiirluni and Ulet soils.  Ulesqiirluni soils are deep silty soils on floodplains.  Ulet soils have sandy strata and are on more frequently flooded positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solumn and high or very in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and water shed. Native vegetation is shrub birch and ericaceous shrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 230, Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands Alaska. The series is of small extent.
