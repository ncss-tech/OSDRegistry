MINERAL SERIES

The Mineral series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and glacial till from granitic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  Mineral soils are on mountainsides and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 535 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buhrig, Canteen, Capoose, Centralpeak, Manley, Merkel, Nevine, Skanid, Stepstone, Vanbrunt, and competing Bearspring soils.  Canteen, Manley, Merkel, Nevine, and Stepstone soils are deeper than 100 cm to bedrock.  Also, the upper sola of these soils are dominated by volcanic ash.  Buhrig and Manley soils are cryic.  Buhrig soils are on mountain slopes and knobs.  Canteen soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  Manley soils are on upper slopes of foothills and mountains.  Nevine and Stepstone soils are on moraines, foothills and mountains.  Capoose soils have a volcanic ash mantle greater than 36 cm thick.  Centralpeak soils are coarse-loamy and have a volcanic ash mantle 18 to 36 cm thick.   Skanid and Vanbrunt soils have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Merkel and Skanid soils are on mountains.  Capoose, Centralpeak, and Vanbrunt soils are on shoulders and backslopes of mountains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used primarily for timber production, grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and scattered western larch at higher elevations, and an understory of pinegrass, kinnikinnick, common snowberry, rose, pachystima, Oregon-grape, creambush oceanspray, and white spirea.
