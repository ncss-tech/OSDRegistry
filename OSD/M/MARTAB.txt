MARTAB SERIES

The Martab series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandstone colluvium.  These soils are on mountains and escarpments.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive Ustollic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Martab loam, forested (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; moderately decomposed leaves, needles, and twigs.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--2 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium and coarse roots; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    E--6 to 17 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 11 inches thick)

    Bt1--17 to 35 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2--35 to 50 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 15 percent soft siltstone chips; slightly effervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk--50 to 60 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent soft siltstone chips; common fine masses and seams of lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records: MT1422, MT1605. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a dark colored horizon from 2 to 6 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 17 to 50 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation from 50 to 60 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 17 to 37 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).  Martab soils have an ustic moisture regime and a cryic temperature regime.
