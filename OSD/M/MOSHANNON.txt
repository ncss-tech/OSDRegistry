MOSHANNON SERIES

MLRAs: 126 (Central Allegheny Plateau)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Dystric Fluventic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Moshannon silt loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes, occasionally flooded, in a meadow. (Colors are for moist soil.)

    Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silty clay loam; weak coarse granular
    structure; friable; common fine and very fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

    Bw1--23 to 43 cm (9 to 17 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; weak medium
    and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and very fine roots; slightly acid; clear
    wavy boundary.

    Bw2--43 to 81 cm (17 to 32 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate coarse and
    medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and very fine roots; moderately acid;
    clear wavy boundary.

    Bw3--81 to 135 cm (32 to 53 inches); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) silty clay loam; moderate
    medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt
    wavy boundary.

    C1--135 to 168 cm (53 to 66 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam; massive; friable; 5
    percent shale fragments; few fine pockets of yellowish red (2.5YR 4/6) iron concentrations
    surrounded by thin manganese coatings; common fine manganese concentrations; moderately
    acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

    C2--168 to 203 cm (66 to 80 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) fine sandy loam; massive;
    very friable; 5 percent shale fragments; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Jackson County, West Virginia; about 400 feet south of the intersection of State Routes 5/12 and 34/1; USGS Ripley, West Virginia, 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; lat. 38 degrees 47 minutes 21 seconds N. and long. 81 degrees 39 minutes 16 seconds W. NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Solum Thickness: 81 to 152 cm (32 to 60 inches)
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 165 cm (65 inches)
Rock Fragment Content: Less than 5 percent in the solum ranging to 20 percent, by volume, in the substratum
Fine-Earth Fraction: 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section
Soil Reaction: Moderately acid to neutral in the Ap horizon, moderately acid or slightly acid in the Bw horizon, and moderately acid to neutral in the C horizon, except where limed

Range in individual horizons:
Ap or A horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 3 or 4
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--silty clay loam or silt loam

BA horizon (if present):
Color--hue of 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 3 or 4
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--silty clay loam or silt loam

Bw horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR or 2.5YR; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 3 through 6

BC horizon (if present):
Color--hue of 5YR or 2.5YR; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 2 through 6

C horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR or 2.5YR; value of 3 through 5; and chroma of 2 through 4
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. Stratification occurs in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:
Nolin soils--do not have hues of 5YR or redder
Kinnick soils--do not have hues of 5YR or redder and have a water table between 3.5 to 6 feet

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Valley
Landform: Flood plain
Parent Material: Alluvium which has its source in areas with a significant portion of the upland soils being derived from the shales and siltstones that weather into reddish soils
Depth Class: Very Deep
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Elevation: 165 to 335 meters (541 to 1099 feet)
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C. (52 to 57 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 1016 to 1270 mm (40 to 50 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Lobdell soils--occur on flood plains that are moderately well drained
Senecaville soils--occur on flood plains that are somewhat poorly drained
Hackers soils--occur on low terraces with an argillic horizon and reddish hues
Upshur soils--occur on uplands with an argillic horizon and reddish hues
Vandalia soils--occur on footslopes with an argillic horizon and reddish hues
Vincent soils--occur on high terraces with an argillic horizon and reddish hues
Woodsfield soils--occur on uplands with an argillic horizon and reddish hues

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class (Agricultural): Well drained
Flooding Frequency and Duration: Occasional, very brief
Ponding Frequency and Duration: None
Index Surface Runoff: Low

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Southeastern Ohio and West Virginia
Extent: Moderate, about 50,000 acres at the time of this revision
