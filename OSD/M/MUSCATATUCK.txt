MUSCATATUCK SERIES

The Muscatatuck series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess, pedisediment, drift and the underlying residuum from limestone. These soils are on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cornwall and Sowcoon series. Cornwall soils do not have rock fragments of mixed lithology in the series control section. Sowcoon soils are deeper than 91 cm (36 inches) to a layer with fragic soil properties. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muscatatuck soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of dissected till plains and in sinkholes. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Muscatatuck soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess, pedisediment, drift and the underlying residuum from limestone. The till is considered to be from the Illinoian or pre-Illinioian stage. Indurated limestone bedrock is typically within a depth of 39 to 49 meters (12 to 15 feet). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days.  Elevation is 107 to 259 meters (350 to 850 feet). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caneyville, Cincinnati, Grayford, Nabb and Ryker soils. The moderately deep, fine Caneyville soils are typically on backslopes of hills underlain with limestone. The well drained Cincinnati and the moderately well drained Nabb soils are on slightly higher lying shoulders and backslopes of till plains. The deep, well drained Grayford soils and the very deep, well drained Ryker soils are generally on similar landform positions as Muscatatuck soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained.  Potential for surface water runoff is low or moderate. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and low or moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of nearly level and gently sloping. Muscatatuck soils are used for growing corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. The steeper slopes generally are in pasture or forest. Native vegetation is deciduous mixed hardwoods. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 114A in Indiana. The series is of small extent.
