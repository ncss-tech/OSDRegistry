Doroshin soils lack sapric soil material and have a clay content range of less than 3 percent
Hewitt soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the mineral substratum and have a mean annual air temperature of -1 to 4 degrees C (30 to 40 degrees F)
Runkelscreek soils are very poorly drained, have ponding,  and occur at elevations below 550 m (1805 ft).
Tacaes soils have dark grey (N 4/) matrix in mineral substratum and occur on glaciolacustrine deposits.
Tepete soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the mineral substratum and have a mean annual air temperature of 1 to 6 degrees C (33.8 to 42.8 degrees F)
