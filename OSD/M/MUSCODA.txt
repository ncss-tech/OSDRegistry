MUSCODA SERIES

The Muscoda series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in re-worked (by wind or water, or both) sandy outwash over loamy alluvium over loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone.  These soils are on strath terraces.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy outwash, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy alluvium and the loamy residuum, and slow to moderate in the sandstone.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.   Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.   

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lamellic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Muscoda loamy fine sand, on a convex, southeast-facing slope of 5 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 715 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) The surface is covered by 1 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles.  The fragments are igneous.

    Ap--0 to 9 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loamy fine sand; brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; about 2 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick)

    E--9 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loamy fine sand; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; about 1 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    E and Bt--16 to 32 inches; about 75 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sand (E); weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 25 percent brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy fine sand lamellae (Bt) (1/4 to 1 inch thick; <6 inches total) moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few faint brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay bridges between sand grains; few very fine and fine roots; about 3 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bt1--32 to 40 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) gravelly sandy loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine and fine roots; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; about 25 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    3Bt2--40 to 50 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) fine sandy loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; few distinct olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 7 percent glauconitic channers; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    3Cr--50 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) and grayish green (5G 4/2) weakly cemented fine-grained glauconitic sandstone; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Brice series.  The Brice soils do not have a paralithic contact in the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: re-worked (by wind or water, or both) sandy outwash over loamy alluvium over loamy residuum from the underlying fine-grained glauconitic sandstone
Landform: strath terrace
Geologic formation: typically the Tunnel City sandstone that is identified, in part by it's high content of glauconitic minerals
Elevation: 700 to 750 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 48 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 30 to 34 inches
Frost-free period: 135 to 165 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Near the type location, these are Balmoral and Nuxmaruhanixete soils.  These soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  The Balmoral and Nuxmaruhanixete soils do not have a paralithic contact with sandstone bedrock within 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well drained
Permeability: rapid in the sandy outwash, moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy alluvium and the loamy residuum, and slow to moderate in the sandstone
Runoff: Very low to low

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Muscoda soils are used for cropland. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay are the principal crops.  A few small areas remain in native vegetation or are used for pastureland.  Native vegetation is a mixture of deciduous forest and prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Wisconsin.  MLRA 105.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-10 (La Crosse, Wisconsin).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richland County, Wisconsin, 2002.  Source of the name is a village along the Wisconsin River in Grant County.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 10 inches.(Ap); 
Albic horizon: the zone from 9 to 16 inches (E);
Argillic horizon: the zone from 32 to 50 inches (2Bt1,3Bt2);
Lamellic subgroup: lamellae with total thickness of less than 6 inches in the series control section;
Paralithic contact: the contact with glauconitic sandstone at 50 inches (3Cr).

The source of the chert, dolostone, and sandstone in the sandy outwash and loamy alluvium is from nearby hills that have been eroded from the river.

An Abstract titled, Geology of the Pre-Illinoian Sediment in the Bridgeport Terrace, Lower Wisconsin River Valley, Wisconsin by James C. Knox and John W. Attig explains the sediments found over a rock bench.  It is thought to be a pre-Illinoian sediment with an eastward-sloping depositional surface.  This was laid down when the flow of the Wisconsin River was to the east as a result from an ice blockage along the Mississippi River.
