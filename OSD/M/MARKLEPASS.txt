MARKLEPASS SERIES

The Marklepass series consists of very deep, well drained, sodium affected soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from lake sediments.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Natrixeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Marklepass silty clay loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap1--0 to 4 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate coarse platy structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots and common fine roots; many fine vesicular pores and common very fine vesicular pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.

    Ap2--4 to 9 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular, slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots and common fine roots; common fine discontinuous tubular pores and few very fine and medium discontinuous tubular pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 5 to 9 inches.)

    Btn/E--9 to 14 inches; B part (60 percent) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and brown (10YR 4/3) moist; E part (40 percent) light gray (10YR 7/2) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist silty clay loam; strong coarse columnar structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine continuous tubular pores and common fine and medium continuous tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; common faint organic stains on faces of peds; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear irregular boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

(5 to 17 inches thick)

    Bkn--20 to 34 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine threads of lime; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); gradual wavy boundary.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT0750.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 9 inches (Ap1, Ap2 horizons); a Bt horizon from 9 to 20 inches (Btn/E, Btn horizons); a horizon of lime accumulation from 20 to 34 inches (Bkn horizon).  A particle-size control section from 9 to 20 inches (Btn/E, Btn horizon).  Marklepass soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime bordering on aridic.
