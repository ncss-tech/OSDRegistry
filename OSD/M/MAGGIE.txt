MAGGIE SERIES

The Maggie series consists of shallow over indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. They are on pediments and hills. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maggie very gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong very thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium vesicular pores; 55 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 8 cm thick)

    A2--3 to 8 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong very thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, and few fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); very abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

    Bt--8 to 20 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 50 percent gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Btk--20 to 36 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in pores; 40 percent gravel, common distinct carbonate pendants on rock fragments; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 33 cm thick)

    Bqkm--36 to 66 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly interlaminated duripan consisting of several continuous indurated 1.9 cm thick laminae and strongly and weakly silica-carbonate cemented strata, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; extremely hard, extremely firm; common very fine and fine roots matted on laminae; few very fine tubular pores; white (10YR 8/1) carbonate and many fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silica coats on gravel; abrupt wavy boundary. (23 to 56 cm thick)

    R--66 cm; extremely hard tuffaceous and rhyolitic bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Nye County, Nevada; about 3 miles northwest of the San Antonio Ranch; about 3,200 feet south and 820 feet west of the northeast corner of Section 2, T. 7 N., R. 41 E.; USGS San Antonio Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 29 minutes 36 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 20 minutes 11 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.4933333 latitude, -117.3363889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days in the upper part July through September following convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 13 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 25 to 40 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 90 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.
Other features: Calcareous is some pedons.

Particle-size control section:  Clay content:  18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments:  40 to 60 percent, mostly gravel.

A horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3.

Bt horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Clay percentage:  18 to 30 percent.
Rock fragments: 40 to 60 percent.
Texture: Fine sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.
Consistence: Slightly hard to hard dry.

Btk horizon  
Texture: Sandy loam or loamy sand.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lyda, Silverbow, Stingdorn, Tokoper and Tomel series. 

Lyda, Silverbow and Tomel soils lack bedrock within 100 cm. Also, Silverbow soils are dominantly clay loam or sandy clay loam with more than 30 percent clay. Stingdorn soils have bedrock at 20 to 50 cm. Tokoper soils have bedrock at 20 to 36cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maggie soils are on pediments and hills at elevations of 1,680 to 1,950 meters. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. They formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from basalt, rhyolite, and latite rocks. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluewing, Dobel, Pintwater, and the competing Lyda soils. Bluewing soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Dobel soils have a loamy argillic horizon. Pintwater soils have a lithic contact and lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing. The vegetation is sparse consisting of a few plants of Bailey greasewood, shadscale, and bud sagebrush with scattered galleta grass, King desertgrass and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Nevada. These soils are inextensive. MLRA 29.
