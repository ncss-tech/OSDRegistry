MUSSELSHELL SERIES 

The Musselshell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Musselshell loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bk1--3 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots and pores; few fine threads of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2--13 to 29 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent limestone gravel with pendants of lime; few threads of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bk horizons is 22 to 36 inches) 

    2C--29 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; few very fine roots; 50 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Musselshell soils are used mainly for rangeland; some areas are dry farmed to wheat or irrigated to hay and pasture. Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, needleandthread, blue grama, and threadleaf sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Musselshell soils are extensive in central and western Montana.  MLRAs 43B, 44B, 46, and 58A.
