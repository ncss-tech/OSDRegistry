MORRILL SERIES

The Morrill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy till. Morrill soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 94 centimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Burchard and 
Shelby soils and Aksarben, Grundy, Mayberry, Pawnee, Sharpsburg, Steinauer, and
Wymore soils.
Burchard, Shelby, and Steinauer soils are on similar topographic positions as Morrill soils.
Steinauer soils do not have a mollic epipedon.
Aksarben, Grundy, Mayberry, Pawnee, Sharpsburg, and Wymore soils are on somewhat 
higher topographic positions and are fine textured. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Well
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: Moderately high 

USE AND VEGETATION: The less sloping areas are cultivated. 
The principal crops are corn, grain sorghum, and winter wheat. 
The more sloping areas are used mainly for pasture or range. 
Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Kansas and eastern Nebraska; large 
extent.

LRR=M
03/29/95 - Added slightly sticky and slightly plastic to horizons and fine tubular to roots. 
Modified Competing Series and Geographically Associated Soils somewhat.
Added Remarks
10/06/94 - Changed gravels to percentage of gravel in Bt1, BC, and C horizons. Changed 
references throughout from gravels to gravel. Changed annual precipitation range to a 
high of 94 centimeters. Added "and udic moisture regime" to Remarks. 
03/29/95 - Changed type location.
05/00 -From Soil Interpretation Record added Clay Content to A and 2C horizons and 
Frost Free Period to Geographic Setting.
11/2005 JCR LM added metric conversion and saturated hydraulic conductivity. 
09/2008 GJJ added some more metric conversions, removed English units, and made 
some minor format changes.
