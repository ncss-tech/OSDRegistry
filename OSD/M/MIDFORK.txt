MIDFORK SERIES

The Midfork series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in stream and slope alluvium.  Midfork soils are on fan aprons and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Midfork very stony loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; 20 percent limestone and dolomite pebbles, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

      A2--4 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very stony loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium and fine granular; soft, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, many medium and coarse roots; 20 percent limestone and dolomite pebbles, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

      C1--10 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, many medium and coarse roots; 20 percent limestone and dolomite pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

      C2--15 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and fine roots; strongly effervescent, lime disseminated; 20 percent limestone and dolomite pebbles, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Teton County, Wyoming; 200 feet east of Middlefork cutoff--Moose Creek trail junction; unsectionized area.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material is 4 to 15 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 32 to 36 degrees F.  The control section is very cobbly loam, very 2 - Midfork Series

gravelly loam, very channery loam, or very cobbly clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 65 percent.
The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 14 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Antrobus, Broad Canyon, Farlow, Fairydell, Foxmount, Grafen, Greyback, Handran, Kamack, McCort, Maurice, Midelight, Parachute, Sebud, Supervisor, Teemat, Tiban, and Tineman series.  Antrobus soils formed in material from basalt and have many dark colored mineral grains in the sand and silt fraction.  Broad Canyon, Foxmount, Grafen, Handran, Kamack, McCort, Maurice, Sebud, and Supervisor soils are noncalcareous.  Fairydell soils have a horizon of silicate accumulation.  Farlow soils have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Greyback soils grade to sandy-skeletal material in the lower part.  Midelight soils have a very channery loam control section.  Parachute soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Teemat soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Tiban soils have a C2 horizon with hue of 2.5YR.  Tineman soils have a horizon of gravelly sand or loamy sand in the lower part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Midfork soils are on fans and mountainsides.  Slopes are 3 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium weathered from calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Elevation is 7,000 to 11,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 30 to 38 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kitchell, Starman, and Spearhead soils.  Kitchell and Spearhead soils are pachic.  Kitchell soils also have a calcic horizon.  Starman soils are shallow over sandstone and are neutral or slightly acid throughout.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is parsley, wild geranium, and wild flax.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of western Wyoming.  The series is of small extent.
