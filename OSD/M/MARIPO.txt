MARIPO SERIES

The Maripo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in recent stratified stream alluvium.  Maripo soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, hyperthermic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maripo sandy loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 14 inches thick)

    C1--13 to 34 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few calcium carbonate filaments in lower part; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 26 inches thick)

    C2--34 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Maricopa County, Arizona; 2,350 feet north and 1,140 feet east of the southwest corner of section 10, T. 2 N., R. 2 W.  Latitude 33 degrees, 31 minutes, 44 seconds N., Longitude 112 degrees, 27 minutes, 27 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section in July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Reaction - slightly to strongly alkaline

Salinity - nonsaline to strongly saline

Calcium carbonate - disseminated or as thin filaments or threads

Organic matter content - less than 1 percent

Rock fragments - The upper part has less than 35 percent gravel in any subhorizon and usually less than 15 percent; the lower part has less than 35 percent in any subhorizon, but individual subhorizons range from 5 to 60 percent.

Depth to sandy substratum - 20 to 40 inches

Texture - Upper part of particle-size control section - fine sandy loam, sandy loam (averages less than 18 percent clay) lower part of particle-size control section (2C) - loamy sand, sand with 5 to 60 percent gravel by volume.  Some pedons have a few thin strata of finer textured soil material

C horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5, 6 or 7 dry, 3, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2, 3, 4 or 6, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Antho (AZ) and Gilman (AZ) series.  Antho and Gilman soils do not have sandy textures in the lower part of the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maripo soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains at elevations of 300 to 2500 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 1 percent but range to 3 percent.  These soils formed in stratified stream alluvium.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 2 to 10 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days.  Precipitation falls as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Agualt, Antho, Brios, Carrizo, Gilman, Glenbar, Mohall and Vint soils.  Agualt soils are similar but are finer textured.  Antho and Gilman are moderately coarse textured throughout.  Brios, Carrizo and Vint soils are sandy throughout.  Glenbar soils are fine- silty.  Mohall soils are on slightly higher positions and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff ; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nonirrigated areas are used for livestock grazing when seasonal rains promote the growth of short-lived annual grasses.  Irrigated areas are used for growing cotton, grain sorghum, small grains, alfalfa and vegetables.  Native vegetation is creosotebush, triangle bursage, cacti, littleleaf paloverde, ironwood and annual grasses and weeds.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Maripo soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA is 40.
