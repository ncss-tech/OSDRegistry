MANTER SERIES

The Manter series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in thick, calcareous, eolian or outwash material.  Manter soils are on hills and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Manter sandy loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  Ap--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches) thick)

  A--20 to 33 centimeters (8 to 13 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; very weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocks; slightly hard, very friable; few faint clay films on some sand grains; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) thick)

  Bt1--33 to 46 centimeters (13 to 18 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, friable, few faint clay films on faces of peds and as coatings on sand grains and as bridges between sand grains; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) thick)

  Bt2--46 to 64 centimeters (18 to 25 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, very friable; few faint clay films on faces of peds, as coatings on sand grains and as bridges between sand grains; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches) thick)

  Bk1--64 to 86 centimeters (25 to 34 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) fine sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few faint clay films on faces of peds and clay films on individual sand grains; secondary calcium carbonate in finely divided and concretionary forms; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (18 to 25 centimeters (7 to 10 inches) thick)

  Bk2--86 to 152 centimeters (34 to 60 inches); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) loamy fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions, soft masses, and in thin seams and streaks; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

Some pedons have a C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Julesburg, Latierra, Mainter, Mawer, Torrington, Truckton and Vitrina series.  
Julesburg soils are noncalcareous, and have a coarse textured C horizon above a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches). 
Latierra soils have rock fragments that range from 10 to 50 percent, averaging 20 to 40 percent pebbles.
Mainter soils have mean annual moistures and temperatures that are a little lower and have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle size control section.  
Mawer soils have noncontrasting sand and gravel substratum at a depth of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  
Truckton soils are noncalcareous.  
Torrington soils have a paralithic contact at 74 centimeters (29 inches).
Vitrina soils are alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: hills and plains
Slopes: 0 to 30 percent
Parent Material: thick, calcareous, eolian or outwash material
Average annual precipitation: 38 to 43 centimeters (15 to 17 inches) with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer
Mean annual air temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C. (48 to 53 degrees F.)
Mean summer temperature: 20 to 22 degrees C. (68 to 71 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ascalon and Vona series. 
Ascalon soils have a fine-loamy control section.  
Vona soils have an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well to somewhat excessively drained

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for native pastureland or for dry or irrigated cropland.  
Native vegetation consists mainly of blue grama, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, bluestem, cactus, and sand sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wyoming.  The series is of large extent.
