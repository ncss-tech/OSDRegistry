MALPAISPRING SERIES

The Malpaispring series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in gypsiferous eolian deposits. These nearly level soils are on salt marshes. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Malpaispring soils are on salt marshes. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed from gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. Elevation ranges from 4,150 to 4,170 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Terrier, Pup, and Gyplaya series. Terrier soils have gypsic mineralogy, Pup soils are on broad drainageways and have vertic properties. Gyplaya soils are on playas and are coarse-gypseous.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; negligible runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton and inland salt grass

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Malpais Spring area of the Tularosa Basin. MLRA 42, Malpaispring is of limited extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: White Sands Missile Range, Otero County, New Mexico, 2014. The name Malpaispring is derived from Malpais Spring, a spring emitting from southwestern terminus of the Carrizozo Lava Flow.
