COMPETING SERIES: The Agueybana series is the only known soil in the same family. 
Agueybana soils--are on similar positions but have thicker argillic horizons and solums. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Humid Mountains and Valleys (MLRA 270).
Landform: Maricao soils are on summits and side slopes
Parent Material: Residuum from volcanic bedrock. 
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 18 to 23 degrees C. (64 to 73 degrees F.).
Mean Annual Precipitation: 2,032 to 2,794 millimeters (80 to 110 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Cuchillas, Los Guineos and Rubias series.
Cuchillas soils--have a cambic horizon, lack argillic horizons and are moderately deep to bedrock.
Los Guineos soils-- have an oxic horizon and much thicker subsoil horizons 
Rubias soils-are moderately deep to bedrock and lack argillic horizons 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: Moderately high to high  

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: Most areas of Maricao soils are used for naturalized pastureland, forestland, bananas, coffee, and plantains
Dominant vegetation: The vegetation consists of native and introduced grasses, shrubs, and trees

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Summits and side slopes of humid mountains of Puerto Rico (MLRA 270). 
The series is moderate extent.
