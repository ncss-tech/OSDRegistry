The Mahone series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in stratified loamy alluvium.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kaskan , Imano, Nickerson , Saxman , Willowbrook series. The well drained, fine-loamy, Kaskan soils have a mollic epipedon and cambic which contain more clay, and are on lower flood plain positions closer to streams. The somewhat poorly drained, fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, Imano and sandy Willowbrook soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower flood plain positions closer to streams. The moderately well drained, fine-loamy Nickerson soils have an argillic horizon and are on nearby terraces. The moderately well drained, sandy Saxman soils do not have buried loamy material above 40 inches (102 centimeters), and are on slightly lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, runoff is low. Permeability is moderate. A seasonal high water table occurs from February to June and ranges from a depth of 60 to 96 inches (152 to 244 centimeters). Mahone soils are rarely flooded for very brief durations.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cultivated crops such as wheat and grain sorghum. A few areas are in pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado
