METTAH SERIES

The Mettah series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, dune and estuarine deposits derived from mixed sources and subsequently uplifted. Mettah soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Notchko series.  Notchko soils have an ustic soil moisture regime.
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mettah soils occur on moderately broad ridges and upper slopes of mountains. Slopes are 9 to 30 percent. Elevations are 296 to 690 meters (970 to 2260 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, dune and estuarine deposits derived from mixed sources which have been uplifted. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2290 millimeters (70 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Surpur and the Ossagon soils. Surpur soils are fine-loamy. Ossagon soils have an umbric epipedon and are yellower than 7.5YR throughout. The Surpur soils are found on weakly consolidated sandy beach and dune deposits. The Ossagon soils are found at lower elevations and closer to the coast.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high runoff; moderately low to low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil has been used for commercial timber and is used for recreation, wildlife and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of redwood, Douglas-fir, western hemlock, tanoak, huckleberry, and rhododendron.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
