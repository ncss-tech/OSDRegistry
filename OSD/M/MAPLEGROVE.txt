MAPLEGROVE SERIES

The Maplegrove series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).. These soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess over a thin mantle of loess over clayey residium. Slope gradient ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Slope: level or nearly level (1 to 3 percent)
Landform:
Landscape: slightly convex broad uplands
Parent material: thin mantle of silty loess over clayey loess over clayey residium. 
Mean annual temperature: 56 to 58 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 38 to 42 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Eldorado soils: on gently sloping side slopes and are loamy skeletal.
Osage soils: on lower terrace positions and are poorly drained and have high shrink-swell potential.  
Newtonia soils: on similar landscape positions and are well drained and are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage: moderately well
Permeability: slow
Runoff:  medium
In undisturbed areas, the upper depth of to water saturation is 2.5 to 3.5 feet during December to February in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in cropland or pasture. A few areas are in native hayland. Principal crops are wheat, corn, milo, and soybeans. Native vegetation is prairie grasses, mainly big and little bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Missouri and possibly Southeast Kansas and Northeast Oklahoma. The soils are of minor extent.  The Maplegrove series is found on the Warsaw and Keokuk formations in the Mississippian geology.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jasper County, Missouri, 2000. The name is from a small community in the northeast part of Jasper County.

REMARKS:  Missouri Characterization Laboratory Sample M9609732.  These soils were formerly included in the Gerald and Creldon series.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 80 inches (2Bt, 3Bt, 4Bt horizons); redox depletions in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.
