MARTELLA SERIES

The Martella series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed volcanic ash over glacial lake sediments. Martella soils are on lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature - 6.7 to 8.3 degrees C
Soil moisture - soil is usually moist in all horizons but is dry in all parts between depths of 10 and 30 cm for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice
Base saturation (by sum of cations) - estimated less than 75 percent in one or more subhorizons within 75 cm (ultic feature).  Further lab data is needed to verify these estimates.

Aits, Clayton, Stapaloop and Waits soils are coarse-loamy.   Aits soils are on glaciated mountains. Cedonia soils are on lake terraces and terrace breaks.  Anglen and Hodgson soils are fine. Anglen soils are on glacial lake terraces and escarpments. Waits soils are on foothills and mountains. Bonner soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Eloika soils are medial over coarse- loamy. Karamin and Scrabblers soils are sandy. Louploup soils are ashy over loamy and are on till plains and mountains. Bonner, Clayton, Eloika, Hodgson, Karamin, Kewach, Scrabblers, and Stapaloop soils are on terraces. Newbell and Elbowlake soils are loamy-skeletal and are on mountain backslopes, footslopes and toeslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; very slow to rapid runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for timber production, grazing and wildlife habitat. Some areas are cultivated for the production of alfalfa, small grains and grasses. Native overstory vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, western larch, grand fir, ponderosa pine, and western redcedar. Understory vegetation is Saskatoon serviceberry, creambush oceanspray, mountain alder, willow, common snowberry, ribes, mallow ninebark, wild rose and Oregon grape. Ground vegetation is mostly white spirea, strawberry, pippsisewa, pachystima, kinnikinnick, meadow rue, and pinegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Valleys and some mountain areas in northcentral and northwestern Washington.  MLRA 43A.  Series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Stevens County, Washington, 1978.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Andic soil properties - from 6 to 39 cm (A, E horizons)
Argillic horizon - from 67 to 83 cm (2Bt horizon)

Additional Information: 
Some pedons have a thin (less than .5 cm) layer with high value and low chroma that are Mount Saint Helen  T or W volcanic ash.

Martella soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
