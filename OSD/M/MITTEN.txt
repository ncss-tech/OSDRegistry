MITTEN SERIES 

The Mitten series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite bedrock.  Mitten soils are on mountain slopes and escarpments.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Andic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mitten gravelly ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    Bw--2 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly ashy silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 15 percent angular gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick) 

    2E--11 to 18 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 45 percent angular gravel, 5 percent angular cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 25 inches thick) 

    2E and Bw--18 to 36 inches; E part (80 percent) is pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; B part (20 percent) is brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, lamellae, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; the lamellae are 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 50 percent angular gravel, 15 percent angular cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); diffuse irregular boundary.  (8 to 35 inches thick) 

    2BC--36 to 60 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; 50 percent angular gravel, 15 percent angular cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6).
