REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 30 to 80 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 30 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 30 to 102 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
