COMPETING SERIES: These are the Koyukuk, and Steese series. Koyukuk soils are formed in very deep silty materials. Steese soils are high in mica and overlie schist bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess mantle over moderately deep, partially weathered granite bedrock
Landform: backslopes, shoulders, and summits of hills and low mountains 
Slope: 0 to 45 percent
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 28 degrees F., -5 to -2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 15 inches, 250 to 380 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Angel, Gilmore and Steese series. Angel soils which are less than 20 inches thick over weathered granitic bedrock. Gilmore soils which are less than 20 inches thick over weathered schist bedrock. Steese soils which are 20 to 40 inches thick over weathered schist bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, moderate to rapid runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy surface mantle and very slow in the granitic bedrock.
. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for military training, roadfill, recreation, water supply, and wildlife habitat.  Most areas are in native forest consisting of paper birch, white spruce, black spruce, and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 231, Interior Alaska Highlands,, The series is of moderate extent.
