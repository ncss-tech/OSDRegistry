MENOMINEE SERIES

The Menominee series consists of very deep, well drained soils on ground moraines, end moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits over loamy till or lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 6 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, active, frigid Alfic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Menominee sand, on a northwest-facing, convex 16 percent slope in forest at an elevation of 277 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on August 30, 1994 the soil was dry in the upper 51 cm and moist below.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Menominee soils are on ground moraines, end moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 12 to 70 percent. These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits over loamy till or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation is 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 150 days. Elevation is 183 to 427 meters (600 to 1400 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Breckenridge, Brevort, Iosco, Kalkaska, Manistee, Rubicon, Ubly and Sims soils. The somewhat poorly drained Iosco and poorly drained or very poorly drained Brevort soils are on lower landscape positions on the landscape and form a drainage sequence with the Menominee soils. Rubicon and Kalkaska soils are sandy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. Manistee soils are clayey in the lower part and are on similar landscape positions. Ubly soils are loamy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Breckenridge and Sims soils are nearby in narrow drainageways on ground moraines in lower lying areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is very slow to medium, depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately high in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: A small part is used for the production of small grain, grass-legume hay, and potatoes. A large part is in permanent pasture or forest. A considerable proportion is idle cropland. Native vegetation is northern hardwoods and conifers, including sugar maple, red pine, yellow birch, and white ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 90A, 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, 96, and 98 in northern lower Michigan, upper Michigan, and northern Wisconsin. This series is of large extent.
