MAES SERIES

The Maes series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Maes soils are on slopes of mountains and have slopes of about 30 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maes cobbly loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; forest litter in various stages of decomposition.

    A1--5 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable; many very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium pores; 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 23 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many medium, few very fine and fine pores; 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear irregular boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    A&B--23 to 46 cm; (A2) very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; and (B2t) blocks of yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) cobbly sandy clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, friable; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many fine pores; 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 cm thick)

    B&A--46 to 94 cm; (B2t) yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) very cobbly sandy clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; and (A2) very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine pores; 30 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; moderately thick clay films on peds; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (38 to 51 cm thick)

    B21t--94 to 150 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) very cobbly sandy clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; thick clay films on peds and patchy clay films on rock fragments; few fine and medium roots; few fine pores; 35 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 51 cm thick)

    B22t--150 to 175 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) very cobbly sandy clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; thin patchy clay films on peds and rock fragments; few fine roots; 50 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2).
