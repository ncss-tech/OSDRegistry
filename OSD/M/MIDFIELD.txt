MIDFIELD SERIES

The Midfield series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on coastal prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1145 mm (49 in).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: A udic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is from 10 to 61 cm (4 to 24 in) in depth.  These soils remain moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 275 days in normal years, with rainfall being fairly uniform throughout the year. The winter months have slightly less rainfall, but soil moisture is highest due to decreased evapotranspiration. Soil moisture is lowest during the summer months when evapotranspiration is highest.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Matagorda County, Texas, 2016.

REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped as the Katy series. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 13 to 63 cm (5 to 25 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in). (Ap horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 13 to 203 cm (5 to 80 in). (Bt horizons)
Secondary carbonates: 101 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in) (2Btk1 and 2Btk2 horizons)
Lithologic Discontinuity: 101 to 203 cm (40 to 80 in) (2Btk1 and 2Btk2 horizons. 

Additional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity was determined by the ratio of very fine sand to fine sand which is markedly different than the overlying horizons and coincides where the horizon color is 5YR or redder and the presence of mica flakes. The reddish subsoil and mica flakes are considered to be a marker of Colorado River sediments.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil survey office lab data available on the typical pedon (NASIS user site id of S2015TX3212500).
