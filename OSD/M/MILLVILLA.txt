MILLVILLA SERIES

The Millvilla series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Millvilla soils are on hills and in canyons. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.
