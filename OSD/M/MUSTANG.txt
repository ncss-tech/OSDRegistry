SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nueces County, Texas, 1963

REMARKS:
Sand mineralogy changed from mixed to siliceous based on a study by USDA-NRCS of the mineralogy of the barrier island system in 2002. The series range of electrical conductivity in the control section was changed from 0 to 8, to 0 to 2 in 2004 during the Soil Survey of Kenedy and Kleberg Counties, Texas.

Typical pedon taxonomic features:
Aquic conditions: 28 to 200 centimeters (Cg horizons)
Endosaturation: 28 to 200 centimeters (Cg horizons)
Iron depletions or depleted matrix: 0 to 200 centimeters (A and Cg horizons)
Masses of oxidized iron: 0 to 200 centimeters (A and Cg horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 28 centimeters (A horizons)
Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (A2 and Cg horizons)
