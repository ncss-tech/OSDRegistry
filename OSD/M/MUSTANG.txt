MUSTANG SERIES

The Mustang series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian and storm washover sediments. These nearly level soils are on planar to concave barrier island flats. These soils are subject to occasional flooding by high storm surge from strong tropical storms and are ponded after periods of heavy rainfall. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 in),and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

The soil is rarely, if ever, at the wilting point below 25 cm (10 in) and it is saturated or ponded for periods of several days or weeks following heavy rains. Coarse fragments of marine shells and shell fragments comprise less than 15 percent by volume.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nueces County, Texas, Nueces County Soil Survey; 1963. The name is from Mustang Island. 

REMARKS: This is a Benchmark Series. 
Sand mineralogy changed from mixed to siliceous based on a study by USDA-NRCS of the mineralogy of the barrier island system in 2002. The series range of electrical conductivity in the control section was changed from 0 to 8, to 0 to 2 in 2004 during the Soil Survey of Kenedy and Kleberg Counties, Texas. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Aquic conditions: These soils remain saturated and have reducing conditions for at least one month in most years from 28 to 203 cm (11 to 80 in). (Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, Cg5 and Cg6 horizons) 
Particle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (A2, Cg1, Cg2 and Cg3 horizons) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in). (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Masses of oxidized iron: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (A1, A2, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, Cg5 and Cg6 horizons) 
Iron depletions or depleted matrix: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (A1, A2, Cg1, Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, Cg5 and Cg6 horizons)
