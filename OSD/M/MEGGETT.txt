SERIES ESTABLISHED: McIntosh County, Georgia; 1960.

REMARKS: 11/22/2005.  Concept of the series revised from high shrink-swell subsoil to moderate shrink-swell.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Abrupt textural change--the boundary between the E horizon and Btg1 horizon
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 8 inches (A, E, horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 5 to 8 inches (E horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 52 inches
COLE and linear extensibility--sufficient difference in the moist length and dry length of a soil aggregate to indicate moderate shrink-swell potential (the zone from 8 to 65 inches)
