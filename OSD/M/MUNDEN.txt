MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: City of Virginia Beach, Virginia, 1980.

REMARKS: 
1. In the past Munden soils have been included with the Altavista, Bertie, Dragston, and Tetotum soils.  The May 2007 revision removes MLRA regions 133A, 152A, and 153C.
2. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon -the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).
b. Argillic horizon -the zone between 8 and 32 inches (Bt horizon). 
c. Aquic feature -low chroma Fe depletions in the upper 24 inches of the 
argillic horizon (Bt3 horizon).
SIR = VA0162
MLRA = 153A, 153B
REVISED = 2/7/96, MHC; 5/07, DTA

ADDITIONAL DATA: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University soil survey lab data shows the typical pedon of the Munden series to have a base saturation of 19.48 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon. 
The particle-size control section has 15.6 percent clay and 29.8 percent silt as a weighted average. Pedon sample numbers are: S74VA76-18(1-9), S76VA76-31(1-9), S77VA76-40(1-8), S77VA76-41(1-6).
