MOYNIER SERIES

The Moynier series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Moynier soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Moynier loam, on a southeast facing, linear, 2 percent slope in riparian streambank vegetation at an elevation of 6,020 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on October 30, 1990 the soil was saturated to the surface.

Clunton:  has particle-size control section with less than 27 percent clay.

Fairbirch:  are loamy-skeletal at 25 to 40 inches.

Hayspur:  has manganese oxide concretions and are sandy-skeletal below 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Mean annual air temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  10 to 12 inches - evenly distributed throughout the year with a slight increase in late summer and fall.
Frost-free period:  90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gooseneck and the Wonsits series.

Gooseneck and Wonsits soils occur on flood plains and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained, low runoff, slow permeability.  These soils are occasionally flooded for long periods during the months of March to July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are wildlife habitat, rangeland, and recreation.  The potential native plant community is willow, slender wheatgrass, rush, sedge, goldenrod, and sunflower.  These soils have been correlated to Wet Fresh Streambank (Willow) - 034XY021UT in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah. 1998.  The name taken from a nearby geographic location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 18 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
Redoximorphic features:  The presence of redox concentrations and redox depletions from 8 to 60 inches. 
Endosaturation:  The presence of a saturated zone from 0 to 1.5 feet during the months of January to December.

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

This soil is at elevations typically associated with mesic temperature regimes, however, because of cool air drainage off of nearby mountains and the influence of cold mountain water it was placed in a frigid temperature regime.
