MACIVER SERIES 

The Maciver series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from calcareous metamorphic and sedimentary rock sources.  These soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, escarpments, hills, mountains or landslides.  Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Maciver loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 7 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bt--7 to 11 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bk1--11 to 23 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) very gravelly clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; many medium segregated masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--23 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) very gravely clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; many medium segregated masses of calcium carbonate; violent effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bk3--30 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravely loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; many medium segregated masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). (combined thickness of the Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons - 33 to 49 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Levengood, Tiban, and Tibson series. Levengood, Tiban, and Tibson soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Maciver soils are primarily used for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, rough fescue, and Richardsons needlegrass.  Some areas have widely spaced Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Maciver soils are of moderate extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.
