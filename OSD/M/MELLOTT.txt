Bowes and Luana soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Churchtown and Festina soils have less than 35 percent sand in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Deroin soils have hue redder than 10YR in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Downs, Ella, Greenbush, Newhouse and Oak Center soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Frankville and Nasset soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Gladek soils have less than 3 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Harvard, Knox, Mannon, Mt. Carroll, and Yutan soils average more than 50 percent silt in the lower part of the argillic horizon or solum. Hersey soils are deeper than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Massbach, Watkins, and Waubeek soils have more than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Myrtle soils have a subhorizon with hue redder than 7.5YR in the matrix or as ped faces in some part of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mellott soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying glaciofluvium and loamy till. The till is friable and contains strata of coarser textures in many places. In places, sandy and or gravelly layers more than 91 cm (36 inches) thick are at depths of 2.4 to 3.6 meters (8 to 12 feet). In most areas, this soil is on the lower lying portions of the till plains adjacent to terraces and floodplains. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Millbrook, Tecumseh and Toronto soils. The somewhat poorly drained Millbrook and Toronto soils are on lower lying landform positions. The well drained Tecumseh soils are on similar landform positions but have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Almost all areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. A few areas are used for hayland, pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed prairie grasses and scattered hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 110 and 111D in west-central Indiana. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of moderate extent.
