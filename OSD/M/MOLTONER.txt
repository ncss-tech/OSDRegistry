MOLTONER SERIES 

The Moltoner series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in saline and sodic alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1573.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the surface to 7 inches mixed (Az and Cz1 horizons); an accumulation of salt and sodium from the surface to 60 inches (All horizons); a particle size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Cz1, Cz2, Czg1 and Czg2 horizons).  Moltoner soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
