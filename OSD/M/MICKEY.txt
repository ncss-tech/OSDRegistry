MICKEY SERIES

The Mickey series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks or volcanic rocks and with surficial deposits of eolian volcanic ash.  Mickey soils are on ballenas and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acana, Diawell, Minu, Muni, and Zadvar series.

Acana soils have calcareous Bt horizons.  Diawell soils have duripans 5 to 13 cm thick and have Bkq horizons above the duripan.  Minu soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C. and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Muni soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C., are not moist in the summer, and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Zadvar soils have durinodes at depths of less than 36 cm and have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mickey soils are on ballenas and fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from granitic rock or volcanic rocks and with surficial deposits of eolian volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,524 to 2,195 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Smedley, Veet and Wellsed soils.  Smedley series are clayey.  Veet soils lack an argillic horizon and a duripan.  Wellsed soils have a duripan with continuous indurated laminae.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff;  moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mickey soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is primarily low sagebrush and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 26 and MLRA27.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Mineral County, Nevada, 1985.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 13 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Cemented duripan - The zone from 38 to 94 cm (Bqkm horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Future study of this series is needed to determine the amount of volcanic ash influence in the A horizons.  Based on lab data from adjacent soils there is a strong possibility that volcanic glass contents in the A horizons are much greater than 30 percent.
