MOCANE SERIES

The Mocane series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous sandy colluvium and alluvium derived from the Laverne (Valentine) Member of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils occur on hillslopes, alluvial fans, and colluvial aprons of dissected high plains. Slopes are 1 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mocane sandy loam on a convex, 3.5 percent linear slope in native rangeland at approximately 705 m (2,312 ft) elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

SERIES PROPOSED:  Beaver County, Oklahoma, 2007. The name is from a historic community in Beaver County.

REMARKS:  

These soils were formerly included in the Otero and Likes soil series.

Many pedons have subsoil horizons with calcium carbonate equivalent values greater than 15 percent, but do not have accompanying features to qualify as diagnostic calcic horizons.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (Ap horizon). 
Paralithic materials: present as discontinuous stratum of weakly cemented sandstone at 28 cm (11 in) (C or Ck horizons).
