MACHONE SERIES

The Machone series consists of moderately deep to strongly weathered granitic rock, well drained soils on hills and rock pediments.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from granitic rock. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Machone sandy loam, on an east-facing lower side slope of a hill, under creosote bush and white bursage, with a slope of 2 to 9 percent at an elevation of 2,545 feet.  (When described on July 18, 1988, the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; 10 percent pebbles (2 to 15 mm in diameter); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    C1--3 to 9 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores and few very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; 10 percent pebbles (2 to 15 mm in diameter); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    C2--9 to 23 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine, medium, coarse, and very coarse roots; few very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; 10 percent pebbles (2 to 15 mm in diameter); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    2Crt--23 to 45 inches; reddish brown strongly weathered granitic rock.  Clay films coat the rock structure in the upper three inches of this horizon.

    2R--45 inches; hard, undiggable granite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Kern County, California; about 2.5 miles north northwest of Edwards AFB headquarters; 1800 feet east and 1050 feet north of the southwest corner of Sec. 14, T. 10 N., R. 10 W., SBBM; Latitude 34 degrees, 57 minutes, 28 seconds north and Longitude 117 degrees, 54 minutes, 31 seconds west; Edwards Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

The mean annual soil temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.

Depth to strongly weathered granitic rock: 20 to 40 inches.

A horizon--10YR 5/3 or 5/4 dry; 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4 moist.
Clay: 8 to 18 percent.
Carbonates: Noneffervescent to slightly effervescent.
Coarse fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel.

C horizon--10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/3 dry; 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3 or 5/4 moist.
Texture: Sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.
Clay: 8 to 18 percent.
Carbonates: Slightly or strongly effervescent, carbonates disseminated.  Some pedons have small amounts of segregated carbonates as threads or seams.

Coarse fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bitterwater, Corbilt (T), Elkhills, Herbel (T), Kimberlina, McCullough, and Seaman (T) soils. All these soils lack bedrock within 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Machone soils are on the lower side slopes of hills, and the summits and side slopes of rock pediments. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from granitic rock. Elevations are 2,375 to 3,400 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches. The mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Muroc and Randsburg soils.  Muroc soils are on similar landforms and have a duripan at a depth of 8 to 20 inches. Randsburg soils are on similar landforms and have a paralithic contact at a depth of 8 to 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Machone soils are used for military operations, building sites, and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is dominantly creosote bush, white bursage, winterfat, spiny hopsage, and desert needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of California.  The series is not extensive in MLRA 30.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES PROPOSED:  Kern County, California, 1988.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile are:

1. Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 3 inches (A horizon).

2. Particle-Size Class -- Coarse-loamy.  The 10- to 23-inch particle-size control section averages 11 percent clay and 70 percent sand based on field estimates (C1 and C2 horizons).

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 9/2015. The last revision to the series was 2/1997. ET
