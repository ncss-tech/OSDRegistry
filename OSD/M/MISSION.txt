MISSION SERIES

The Mission series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that are shallow to a fragipan. They formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Permeability is very slow in the fragipan. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mission soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 2,050 to 2,500 feet. The soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and a mantle of volcanic ash. Average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F; average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 35 inches. The frost-free period is about 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bonner, Colburn, Odenson, Elmira, Hoodoo, Pend Oreille, Pywell, and Selle soils. All these soils lack a fragipan and an argillic horizon. Bonner, Colburn, Odenson, Elmira, and Selle soils are on terraces. Hoodoo and Pywell soils are on valley bottoms and flood plains. Pend Oreille soils are on foothills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow on level areas and rapid on steeper areas. Permeability is very slow in the fragipan.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for cropland, hay, pasture, grazing, homesites, wildlife habitat, recreation, and woodland. Cultivated crops are alfalfa hay, grass-legume hay, and small grains. The natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, western larch, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, paper birch, quaking aspen, and red alder with an understory of violet, goldthread, piper anemone, fairyslipper orchid, myrtle pachystima, rose, queencup beadlily, American trailplant, and fairybells.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and northwestern Montana, and possibly northeastern Washington. The soils of this series are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stevens County, Washington, 1913.

REMARKS: Classification change from Ashy, frigid Andic Fragiboralfs to ashy, glassy, frigid Andic Fragiudalfs. This change is based on Soil Taxonomy 2nd Ed.  Vegetation indicates udic moisture regime. It could also fit an Aquic subgroup.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 4 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - the zone from 13 to 22 inches and 34 to 49 inches (2Btx, 2Bt1, and 2Bt2 horizons)

Fragipan - the zone from 13 to 22 inches (2Btx horizon)

Volcanic ash mantle - the zone from 2 to 13 inches (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)

Redoximorphic features - start at 13 inches (2Btx horizon)

Particle-size control section - 2 to 13 inches (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)
