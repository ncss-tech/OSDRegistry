COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baraboo, Birkbeck, Cadiz, Campton, Elco, Eleroy, Hedrick, Homen, Inton, Iona, Libre, Minnith, Newvienna, Redbud, Rocheport, Rockfield, Somonauk, Uniontown, Winfield, and Zurich series.  Baraboo soils have a lithic contact with quartzite at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Birkbeck soils have a loess mantle more than 40 inches thick to the discontinuity with till and are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to carbonates. Cadiz soils have more than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Campton soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to carbonates. Elco, Hedrick, Homer, Inton, Libre, Minnith, Newvienna, and Winfield soils do not have carbonates within the series control section. Eleroy and Rocheport soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Iona and Uniontown soils have more than 50 percent silt and less than 10 percent sand throughout the series control section. Morningsun and Somonauk soils are more than 40 inches deep to carbonates. Redbud soils have more than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section and are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to carbonates. Rockfield soils have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section. Zurich soil are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mayville soils typically are on ground moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loess and in the underlying till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 940 mm (28 to 37 inches).  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 11.1 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F).  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dodge, Lamartine, and St. Charles soils.  The well drained Dodge soils and the somewhat poorly drained Lamartine soils form a drainage sequence with Mayville soils.  St. Charles soils occupy contiguous areas of similar slopes where loess thickens to greater than 102 cm (40 inches). 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained.  The potential for surface runoff is low or medium.  saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometer per second) in the solum  and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometer per second) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum.  Mayville soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) for 1 month or more per year, at some time during November to April, in 6 or more out of 10 years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of the soil is used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  Some canning crops such as peas and sweet corn are also grown.  Native vegetation is primarily deciduous forest.  Common trees are northern red oak, white oak, American basswood, sugar maple, white ash, and bitternut hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 95A, 95B, and 108A in southeastern Wisconsin and northeastern and central Illinois.  These soils are of moderate extent.
