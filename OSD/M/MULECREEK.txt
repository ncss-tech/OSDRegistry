MULECREEK SERIES

The Mulecreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. Mulecreek soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1650 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mulecreek soils are on stream terraces or alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. Elevations are 730 to 825 meters. These soils formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 1780 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C. Frost free season is about 60 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Frostvalley soil. Frostvalley soils do not have redoxomorphic features within 200 centimeters of the mineral soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained, low or medium runoff, moderately high to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for pasture and irrigated vegetable crops. Vegetation is annual and perennial grasses, pennyroyal, western rush, and other forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 5. The series is not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.
