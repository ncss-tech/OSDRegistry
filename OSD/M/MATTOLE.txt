MATTOLE SERIES

The Mattole series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone. Mattole soils are on hills and slopes range from 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1650 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Palexeralfs
