MODESTY SERIES

The Modesty series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Modesty silty clay loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oe--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed organic matter. (0 to 1 inch thick)

    A--1 to 9 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very hard, firm, nonsticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick)

    Bw1--9 to 16 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, nonsticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw2--16 to 32 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, nonsticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw3--32 to 39 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common fine and very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (17 to 30 inches thick)

    2C--39 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common fine and very fine irregular pores; 10 percent cobbles, 25 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans; stream terraces; glacial outwash plains.
Elevation -  3,600 to 4,600 feet.
Slope - 0 to 4 percent.
Parent material - alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; moderately slow permeability above the discontinuity and moderately rapid permeability in the discontinuity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for irrigated cropland, hay and pasture.  The native vegetation is mainly tall reedgrass, tufted hairgrass, prairie cordgrass, basin wildrye, and Nebraska sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Modesty series is of small extent in the mountain valleys of southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1289.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from 1 to 16 inches (A, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 16 to 39 inches (Bw2, Bw3 horizons); a lithologic discontinuity at 39 inches (2C horizon); a particle-size control section from 11 to 41 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, 2C horizons).  Modesty soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aquic.
