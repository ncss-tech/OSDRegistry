MOCLOM SERIES

The Moclom series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Morrison formation conglomerate. Moclom soils are on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Lithic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Moclom gravelly sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 45 percent rounded gravel.

 A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 20 percent rounded gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

 C--3 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 10 percent rounded gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick)

 R--10 inches; Morrison formation conglomerate bedrock. 

TYPE LOCATION: Garfield County, Utah; about 1 mile south of Wide Hollow Reservoir; located about 2,300 feet east and 700 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 12, T. 35 S., R. 2 E. Wide Hollow Reservoir USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 46 minutes 18.40 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 38 minutes 0.83 seconds W, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Ustic aridic moisture regime

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 56 degrees F.

Depth to lithic contact: 4 to 20 inches to Jurassic age Morrison formation conglomerate 

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 1 to 10 percent
Sand content: the sands are dominantly medium in size
Rock fragments:  1 to 35 percent rounded gravel

A horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Rock fragments: 5 to 35 percent rounded gravel
Effervescence: noneffervescent to moderately effervescent
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

C horizon
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: coarse sand, sand, loamy sand, the sand separates are dominantly medium or coarser in size
Rock fragments: 1 to 35 percent rounded gravel
Effervescence: noneffervescent to slightly effervescent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 10 percent
Reaction: neutral or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arches (UT), Needle (AZ) and Schooner (WY) series. Arches soils have sands that are dominantly fine with a small percentage of medium or coarser sand and have 2.5YR to 7.5YR hues. Needle soils have a Typic aridic soil moisture regime. Schooner soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moclom soils are on hills and dipslopes of cucstas on structure benches at elevations of 4,300 to 7,180 feet. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. These soils formed on residuum and alluvium derived from Morrison formation conglomerate. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches. The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Cannonville series. The Cannonville soils are clayey and are on shale and mudstones.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, very low to medium runoff, rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation. Potential native vegetation is Utah juniper, broom snakeweed, green Mormon tea, two-needle pinyon, Indian ricegrass, galleta, and roundleaf buffaloberry. These soils have been correlated to the Semidesert Shallow Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) 035XY221UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central, Utah and northern Arizona; MLRA 35; this series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Garfield County, Utah, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument soil survey area, 2004. The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Lithic contact - the contact with conglomerate 10 inches (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Soils classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010
