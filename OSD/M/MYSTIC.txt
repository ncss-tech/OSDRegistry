MYSTIC SERIES

The Mystic series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvial sediments derived from glaciers.  These soils are on treads and risers of high structural benches that border valleys of major streams and their tributaries.  Slope ranges from 5 to 18 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Appanoose County, Iowa, 1970.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 23 to 73 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (Ap and BE horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 23 to 137 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons;)
udic moisture regime.

These landform areas are distinctly higher in elevation than the modern flood plains but are lower in elevation than the adjacent late Wisconsin recent dissection slopes.

Type location was moved in 2008 because original location has been disturbed.
