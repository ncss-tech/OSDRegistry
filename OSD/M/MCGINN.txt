MCGINN SERIES

The McGinn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy deposits and in loamy till on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McGinn soils are on ground moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The McGinn soils formed in sandy deposits and in loamy till. Where McGinn soils are in dissected landscapes, they occupy mid to upper convex slopes. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Klacking, Graycalm, Mancelona, and Chinwhisker soils. These soils occupy positions lower on the landscape than the McGinn soils and formed in stratified outwash or glaciolacustrine deposits.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is forested. Tree species are dominantly northern red oak, white oak, and bigtooth aspen. Red maple, paper birch, white ash, red pine and white pine occur to a small extent. Native vegetation is northern red oak and red pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northeast quarter of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 10 cm (4 inches) (Oi, A, and E horizons).
Albic horizon: from a depth of 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches) and from 41 to 46 cm (16 to 18 inches) (E and E' horizons).
Glossic horizon: from a depth of 46 to 64 cm (18 to 25 inches) (E/B and B/E horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 53 to 89 cm (21 to 35 inches) (Bt part of the B/E horizon and Bt horizon).

The McGinn soils were mapped as Emmet soils prior to 1988. They depart from the concept of Emmet soils by having a glossic horizon and by being more acid in the argillic horizon.
