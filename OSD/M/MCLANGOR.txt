MCLANGOR SERIES 

The McLangor series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic materials over stratified silty mineral materials.  These soils are on flood plains and in depressions on outwash terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic, frigid Terric Haplohemists 

TYPICAL PEDON:  McLangor mucky peat, on a nearly level, smooth floodplain, wet meadow hayland (Colors are for moist soil). 

    Oe1--0 to 8 inches; black (10YR 2/1) broken face and rubbed mucky peat (hemic material); about 70 percent fiber and raw herbaceous plant material, about 30 percent rubbed; nonsticky and nonplastic; herbaceous fiber, mostly residue from Phragmites arundinacea; many very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. 

    Oe2--8 to 17 inches; black (10YR 2/1) broken face and rubbed mucky peat (hemic material); about 50 percent fiber, about 20 percent rubbed; nonsticky and nonplastic; herbaceous fiber; common very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Oi1 and Oi2 horizons is 16 to 34 inches).

(2 to 11 inches thick) 

    C2--20 to 36 inches; stratified (1/4 to 1/2 inch) light gray (10YR 7/2) silt and very fine sandy loam; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and  nonplastic;  common very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 28 inches thick) 

    C3--36 to 42 inches; stratified (1/4 to 3/4 inch) very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mucky silt loam (60 percent), dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam (30 percent), and black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat (10 percent); massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick) 

    Oa--42 to 54 inches; black (10YR 2/1) broken face and rubbed muck (sapric material); about 30 percent fiber, about 5 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; herbaceous fiber; common very fine and fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick) 

    Cg--54 to 70 inches; stratified (1/4 to 1/2 inch) gray (5Y 6/1) silt and silt loam; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8).
