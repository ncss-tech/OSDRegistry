MOUNTPOOR SERIES

The Mountpoor series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granogabbro, granodiorite, or rhyolite as sills and dikes in shale of the Mancos formation.  These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Typic Palecryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Mountpoor loam, on a east facing, 47 percent mountain slope, under spruce-fir woodland at an elevation of 9,620 feet.  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on October 9, 1985, the soil was moist in some parts.)

    B/E--31 to 39 inches; (B portion -70 percent) light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; (E portion - 30 percent) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; this horizon consists of intermixed blotches of clay B material and clay loam E material; 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt--39 to 69 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6). (20 to 40 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mortenson series. The Mortenson soils are dry for more than 30 days in summer and contain sandstone rock fragments. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mountpoor soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from granogabbro, granodiorite, or rhyolite as sills and dikes in shale of the Mancos formation on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  Elevation ranges from 9,400 to 10,800 feet.  The mean annual temperature is about 33 to 39 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 to 33 inches.  The frost-free period is 50 to 65 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Baird Hollow and Lizardhead soils. The Baird Hollow soils are on footslopes of mountains and have a mollic epipedon. Lizardhead soils are on backslopes and summits and have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wood products. Native vegetation is currently seral aspen with and understory of slender wheatgrass, elk sedge, blue wildrye, aspen peavine, and common juniper. Potential native vegetation is Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir woodland with an understory of elk sedge, dwarf blueberry, common juniper, and kinnikinnick. It is in the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Woodland Site, Forest Cover Type 206.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Colorado in LRR E and MLRA 48A. The series is of small extent.
