  Major Uses: Wetland wildlife, shellfish, and small crustacean habitat. Large areas of these soils in Delaware have been ditched to provide better drainage for mosquito control.
  Vegetation: Salt-tolerant wetland herbaceous species, predominantly salt marsh cordgrass, salt hay, salt wort and spike grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
  Distribution: Coastal and estuarine areas of Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland
  Extent: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1995.

REMARKS: Mispillion soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. These soils are flooded by tidal waters twice daily and by storm surge, except in areas protected by dikes and tide gates. In protected areas, the soils are commonly ponded under several inches of brackish water. These soils become extremely acid when drained or removed from the marsh.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
High n-value--the zone from the surface to 32 inches has n-value greater than 0.7, typically greater than 1.0 (the material flows easily between the fingers when squeezed)
Sulfidic materials--incubated samples, to a depth of 80 inches, show a drop in pH of 0.5 or more units to a pH value of 4.0 or less within 8 weeks
Hemic soil materials--the zone from 0 to 24 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is one-sixth to two-fifths of the soil volume
Sapric soil materials--the zone from 24 to 40 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume
