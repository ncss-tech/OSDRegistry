SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1995.

REMARKS: 
Mispillion soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. These soils are continuously saturated and flooded by brackish or saline tidal waters twice daily and by storm surge, except in areas protected by dikes and tide gates. In protected areas, the soils are commonly flooded under several inches of brackish water. Oxidized pH analysis indicates these soils have sulfidic materials (pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation), causing them to typically become ultra acid to extremely acid when drained. Historically, large areas of these soils were ditched for mosquito control, which has led to marsh degradation in some areas.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 203 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
Fluidity--the zone from 102 to 203 centimeters is moderately fluid to very fluid (has n value greater than 0.7, typically greater than 1.0)
Hypersulfidic materials--the zone from 0 to 203 centimeters (oxidized pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist incubation)
Hemic soil materials--the layer between 0 and 61 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing of one-third, by volume
Sapric soil materials--the layer from 61 to 102 centimeters has a fiber content after rubbing less than one-sixth, by volume
