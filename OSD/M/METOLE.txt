METOLE SERIES

The Metole series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from travertine. These soils are on travertine terraces and have slopes of 1 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Formation, Spaa, Vertine, Wospring, and Wover series.  Formation soils are well drained and are on adjacent travertine terraces and old drainageways.  Spaa soils are shallow to travertine bedrock.  Vertine soils are somewhat poorly drained and moderately deep to travertine bedrock.  Wospring soils are poorly drained.  Wover soils have a histic epipedon and are poorly and very poorly drained.  All of these soils are found on the same landform as Metole.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Well drained
Runoff:  Low
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: High

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: Livestock grazing, wildlife, and watershed
