MOLEN SERIES

The Molen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sands and colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded shale and sandstone.  Molen soils are on cuestas, structural benches, and escarpments on edges of mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cedar Mountain, Gerst, Hernandez, Lazear and Pacon series.  The Cedar Mountain and Gerst soils are shallow to shale and are on shale hills.  The Lazear and Pacon soils are shallow to sandstone and are in more convex positions on structural benches.  The Hernandez soils are very deep and are in more concave positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, medium to high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists mainly of blue grama, galleta, sand dropseed, Indian ricegrass, shadscale, rabbitbrush, spiny horsebrush, fourwing saltbrush, prickleypear and black greasewood.  These soils are correlated to semidesert ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Utah; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.
