MALAQUITE SERIES

The Malaquite series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian and storm washover sediments on barrier islands.  These nearly level soils are on planar to concave barrier flats.  These soils are subject to occasional flooding by high storm surge from strong tropical storms, and are ponded after periods of heavy rainfall.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

Soil Moisture: An aquic soil moisture regime.  Although rainfall amounts are that of an ustic moisture regime, the soil has a permanent water table at depths of 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in) throughout the year in most years.  The soil is rarely, if ever, at the wilting point below 25 cm (10 in) and it is saturated or ponded for periods of several days or weeks following heavy rains.
Mean annual soil temperature: 23 to 24 C (74 to 76 degrees F)
Depth to masses of oxidized iron: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in)
Depth to iron depletions: 15 to 61 cm (6 to 24 in)
Depth to endosaturation: 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in) throughout the year in most years.

Madre soils: are Sodic Psammaquents and do not have a salic horizon.
Mustang soils: are Typic Psammaquents and is neither salic nor sodic.
Satatton and Tatton soils: are Sodic Psammaquents and have higher salinity throughout.
Saucel, Topo and Yarborough soils: have a coarse-loamy control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Eolian and storm washover sandy sediments of Holocene age

Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 22 to 23 degrees C (71 to 73 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 635 to 889 cm (25 to 35 in)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Daggerhill, Greenhill, Madre, Mustang, Novillo, Padre, Panam, Satatton, and Tatton series.
Daggerhill and Greenhill soils: are Ustic Quartzipsamments and are on a higher landform on convex foredunes and back-island dune fields.
Madre and Mustang soils: are on a similar to slightly higher landform.
Novillo soils: are Typic Psammaquents, are very poorly drained and are on a lower landform in fresh-water marshes.
Padre and Panam soils: are Aquic Quartzipsamments and are on a slightly higher landform on low dunes or mounds on barrier flats.
Satatton and Tatton soils: are on a lower landform on planar to concave wind-tidal flats.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible due to the depressional feature of the barrier flat.  Permeability is rapid above the high water table, but the overall permeability class is very slow.  These soils are subject to occasional flooding for brief periods by high storm surge during strong tropical storms.  The soils are ponded for several days to several weeks following periods of heavy rainfall.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily as wildlife habitat and for recreation.  Native vegetation is seashore saltgrass, saltflat grass, bushy sea oxeye daisy, salicornia and wolfberry with some interspersed barren areas.  The ecological site is Salt Flat, PE 31-44 (150BY651TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast Saline Prairies (MLRA 150B in LRR T) on barrier islands along the lower Gulf Coast of Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kleberg County, Texas, 2007.  The name is from the Malaquite Beach and Visitor's Center on Padre Island National Seashore.

REMARKS:  This series was formerly included in the Mustang series.  The series are separated based on the difference in salinity and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of the soils.

Aquic conditions: These soils remain saturated and have reducing conditions for at least one month in most years from 5 to 80 inches. (Cnzg1, Cnzg2, Anzb, Cnzgb1, Cnzgb2, and Cnzgb3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in). (Anz horizon)
Particle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (Cnzg1, Cnzg2, Anzb, Cnzgb1, and Cnzgb2 horizons)
Sodic feature (SAR more than 13): 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (Anz, Cnzg1, Cnzg2, Anzb, Cnzgb1, Cnzgb2, and Cnzgb3 horizons)
Masses of oxidized iron: 0 to 97 cm (0 to 38 in). (Anz, Cnzg1, Cnzg2, Anzb, and Cnzgb1 horizons)
Iron depletions or depleted matrix: 13 to 203 cm (5 to 80 in). (Cnzg1, Cnzg2, Anzb, Cnzgb1, Cnzgb2, and Cnzgb3 horizons)
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation at 13 to 203 cm (5 to 80 in). (Cnzg1, Cnzg2, Anzb, Cnzgb1, Cnzgb2, and Cnzgb3 horizons).
