MUCKAMUCK SERIES

The Muckamuck series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium.  Muckamuck soils are located on terraces and alluvial bottoms. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Muckamuck silt loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

    BA--7 to 18 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

   Bw--18 to 28 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick)

   C--28 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5). 

TYPE LOCATION:  Okanogan County, Washington; in cultivated area about 350 feet north of junction of Harts Pass, Early Winters, and Winthrop roads and 50 feet west of Harts Pass road NW  SE  SE  sec.25, T.36N, R.19E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 28 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  

A and BA horizon 
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2 dry or moist
Texture: loam or silt loam
Organic matter: 1 to 3 percent

Bw horizon 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist 
Texture: loam, silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  

C horizon 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture: gravelly loam or silt loam. (Some pedons have thin discontinuous strata of sand).
Gravel content: 10 to 25 percent 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muckamuck soils are on low terraces and alluvial bottoms.  Elevation is 1,400 to 2,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Muckamuck soils formed in alluvium derived in part from glacial outwash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 17 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 125 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boesel, Leiko and Winthrop soils.  Boesel series are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Winthrop and Springdale soils have a mesic temperature regime and are somewhat excessively drained.  In addition, Leiko soils are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability; occasional flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for irrigated orchards, hay, pasture, some row crops, dryland crops, and woodland.  The native vegetation is ponderosa pine, douglas fir, and cottonwood with an understory of common snowberry, saskatoon serviceberry, lupine, tall Oregon-grape, shiny-leaf spirea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Washington; MLRA 6 and 43.  Muckamuck series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Okanogan County, Washington; 2005.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 18 inches.
Cambic horizon:  the zone from 18 to 28 inches.

This series was identified as Boesel Variant in the Okanogan County Area, Washington soil survey published in 1980.

An irregular decrease of organic matter is assumed based on the landform and parent material.
