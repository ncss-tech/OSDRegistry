MOBEETIE SERIES

The Mobeetie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, sandy alluvium and colluvium derived from the Ogallala Formation of Mio-Pliocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping valley flats or gently sloping to steep valley side or scarp. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 496 mm (20 in) and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

Mean annual air temperature: 15 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F). 
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 559 mm (17 to 23 in).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the similar Berda, Guadalupe, Likes, and Veal soils and the Ady, Alibates, Bippus, Manson, Plemons, Potter, Sprone, and Tascosa soils. 
Berda, Veal, and Likes soils: are on similar landscape positions. 
Bippus and Sprone soils: are on lower landscape positions and have 18 to 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section. 
Guadalupe soils: are on lower landscape positions. 
Ady, Alibates, Manson, and Plemons soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions and have an argillic horizon. 
Potter and Tascosa soils: are on slightly higher landscape positions and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately rapid permeability. Runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 10 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are primarily used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is dominantly little bluestem, sideoats grama, sand bluestem, and blue grama. Sand sagebrush is the major woody species along with small amounts of yucca and skunkbush. This soil has been correlated to the Mixedland Slopes (R077EY061TX) ecological site in MLRA-77E. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA 77E in LRR H) of western Texas, eastern New Mexico, and northwestern Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: The Mobeetie series is a Benchmark soil. 
The Mobeetie series was formerly included in the Berthoud series. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A horizon) 
Cambic horizon: 25 to 107 cm (10 to 42 in) (Bw & Bk horizon) 
Buried darkened layers are present in some pedons below 60 cm (24 in) of the soil surface; in addition, some pedons have loamy sand strata below 150 cm (60 in).
