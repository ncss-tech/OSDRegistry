TYPE LOCATION: Charlotte County, Virginia; Roanoke Plantation, 350 yards south of main house, 60 yards west of lane. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 72 inches. Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent in the particle-size control section, and silt content is less than 30 percent. Rounded or waterworn rock fragments of quartz, quartzite, gneiss, or schist range from 0 to 50 percent in the A and E horizons and from 0 to 35 percent in the B and C horizons. Stone lines consisting of waterworn stones are present in the lower part of the solum and C horizons in some pedons. Flakes of mica and black minerals are commonly in the B horizon. The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where limed. 

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. 

The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. Eroded areas include sandy clay loam. 

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. 

The BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. High chroma mottles are commonly present. The Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. 

The BC or BCt horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. High chroma mottles are commonly present. 

The BC or BCt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction. 

The C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8, or it is multicolored commonly in shades of yellow, brown, and red. Redoximorphic features in shades of white or gray may occur in some pedons below 60 inches. Texture is sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and their gravelly or cobbly analogues. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Albertville, Badin, Bengal, Bonwier, Brockroad, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Cunningham, Cuthbert, Enders, Endsaw, Fluvanna, Galilee, Kirvin, Luverne, Mattaponi, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Remlap, Sweatman, Tatum, Totier, Townley, Uwharrie, Urland, Vance, and Williamsville series in the same family. Albertville, Brockroad, Catharpin, Fluvanna, McQueen, Nason, Sweatman, and Tatum soils have more than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Bengal, Bonwier, Cunningham, Luverne, and Vance soils have sola less than 40 inches thick. Badin, Cuthbert, Galilee, and Townley soils have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Carnasaw, Enders, Endsaw, and Totier soils have rock fragments dominated by shale or sandstone. Kirvin, Urland, and Williamsville soils commonly contain ironstone pebbles. Mattaponi soils have less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fraction of the upper part of the B horizon. Mayodan soils are developed in residuum from shale and sandstone and have rock fragments dominated with shale and sandstone. Remlap soils have 60 to 70 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Uwharrie soils are developed in residuum from the Carolina 
Slate Belt and have more than 30 percent silt in the control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Masada soils are on high stream terraces in the Piedmont Plateau and in the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The slopes are generally between 2 and 6 percent with a range of 0 to 25 percent. The soils developed in alluvium from land surfaces underlain by felsic rocks. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 degrees F to 64 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Altavista, Appling, Cecil, Cullen, Hiwassee, Turbeville, and Wickham soils. Altavista and Wickham soils average less than 35 percent clay in the control section. Appling and Cecil soils have kaolinitic mineralogy. Cullen soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section, are formed from residuum of mixed acid and basic rocks, contain angular rock fragments, and are underlain by C horizons of saprolite. Hiwassee soils have dark red Bt horizons. Turbeville soils have a thicker Bt horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff, medium internal 
drainage; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are cleared and used for crops and pasture. Crops are corn, wheat, oats, mixed hay, vegetables, peach and apple orchards, and plant nurseries. Native vegetation consists of red oak, white oak, hickory, cedar, dogwood, maple, shortleaf, loblolly and Virginia pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Virginia; possibly Maryland and North Carolina. The series is of moderate extent.
