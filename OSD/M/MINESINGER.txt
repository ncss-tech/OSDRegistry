MINESINGER SERIES 

The Minesinger series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.
