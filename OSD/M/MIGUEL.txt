MIGUEL SERIES

The Miguel series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and/or clayey residuum weathered from sandstone and/or mudstone of Tertiary age. The soils occur on nearly level to moderately sloping, plane to convex low hills on inland, dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, hyperthermic Typic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Miguel fine sandy loam in rangeland at an elevation of 67 m (220 ft).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for rangeland and improved pastures, but some areas are cultivated to cotton, grain sorghum, peanuts, and flax.  Native vegetation consists of little bluestem, feathery bluestem, Nash and hooded windmillgrass, Texas and plains bristlegrass.  Invaders are mainly woody; they are mesquite trees, spiny hackberry, colima, and pricklypear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Land Resource Region I, Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region; MLRA 83A, Northern Rio Grande Plains of Texas.  This soil is of large extent.
