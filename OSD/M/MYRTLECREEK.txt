MYRTLECREEK SERIES

The Myrtlecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on dissected terraces, escarpments and canyonsides.  They formed in sandy glacial outwash with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid to very rapid below.  Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Vitrandic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Myrtlecreek sandy loam, woodland; on an east-facing slope of 34 percent at 3,200 feet elevation. When described on August 18, 1994, the soil was slightly moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Selle and the Snowlake series.  The Selle soils do not have coarse sand textures in the substratum.  The Snowlake soils have average annual soil temperatures of 44 to 46 degrees F. and are dry in the moisture control section for 35 to 45 days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Myrtlecreek soils are mainly on north and east-facing dissected terraces, escarpments, and canyonsides.  At higher elevations, they also occupy west-facing similar landscape positions.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  They formed in sandy glacial outwash with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers.  Elevations range from 2,300 to 4,500 feet.  The average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dodgecreek (T), Pend Oreille, and Snowlake (T) soils.  Dodgecreek soils are on outwash terraces and have a  mantle of volcanic ash.  Pend Oreille soils are on north and east-facing mountains and have a volcanic ash mantle greater than 14 inches thick.  Snowlake soils are on south and west-facing dissected terraces and escarpments and have warmer mean annual soil temperatures and have more days dry in the moisture control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid to very rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for woodland, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, western larch, and Douglas-fir, with an understory of common princes pine, longtube twinflower, myrtle pachystima, queencup beadlily, western rattlesnake plantain, and darkwoods violet.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana, and northeastern Washington.  This series is not extensive.
