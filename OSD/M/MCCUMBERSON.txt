COMPETING SERIES: These are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: till plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly till
Elevation: 2,782 to 3,442 feet (848 to 1,049 m)
Slope: 2 to 12 percent
Annual precipitation: 30 to 35 inches (712 to 894 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Basaltlake, Frostcircle, and Phelanna soils. Basaltlake soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains. Frostcircle soils are poorly drained, very shallow or shallow to permafrost, and occur on mountains. Phelanna soils are poorly drained, very deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is shrub birch-dwarf ericaceous mosaic.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
