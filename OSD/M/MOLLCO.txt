MOLLCO SERIES

The Mollco series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation. These soils are in depressional areas with slope less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20.0 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Similar soils are the Colita, Derly, Evadale, Mollville, Vimville, and Waller soils.

Colita soils: paralithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in)
Derly, Evadale, Mollville, Vimville and Waller soils: are poorly drained. In addition, Derly soils have a fine particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock from the Beaumont Formation
Landscape: open depressions on strand plains
Landform: flat coastal plains

Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1524 mm (48 to 60 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is generally uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the spring and fall. 
Frost-free period: 240 to 300 days
Elevation: 3.0 to 22.9 m (10 to 75 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Craigen soils. 
Craigen soils: have a sandy surface layer; moderately well drained on are on the relic dune adjacent to the Mollco soils

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Moderately slowly permeable.  Runoff is negligible.  The soil is ponded to 0.5 ft above the soil surface for 4 to 8 months during most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for wildlife land or hardwood forest of water oak, red maple, and cypress.  Understory is mainly bluestem, sedge, panicum, paspalum, Carolina jointail, and rush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas; Land Resource Region- T; MLRA 152B (Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods.  The series is of minor extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jefferson County, Texas; 1996.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included with the Byars series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon  0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) (A, E1, and E2 horizons).
Argillic horizon  41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) (Btg/E1, Btg/E2, Btg/E3, and Btg/E4 horizons).
Glossic horizon  41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) (same as argillic horizons).
Aquic soil conditions  0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) in normal years.
Reduced matrix  56 to 97 cm (22 to 38 in) (Btg/E2 horizon).

Additional Comments: The Winnie series is similar but is correlated in MLRA 150A.
