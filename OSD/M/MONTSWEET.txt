MONTSWEET SERIES

The Montsweet series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively to well drained soils that formed in eolian sands over residuum weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Aridic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Montsweet sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 10 cm thick)

    BC--10 to 23 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 2 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 14 cm thick)

    C1--23 to 45 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) loamy sand, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 10 percent paragravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 26 cm thick)

    C2--45 to 80 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very paragravelly loamy sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 40 percent paragravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (30 to 40 cm thick)

    Cr--80 cm; sandstone bedrock.
