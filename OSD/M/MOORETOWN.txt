MOORETOWN SERIES

The Mooretown series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Mooretown soils are on flood plains and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mooretown loam, in pastureland - on a 1 percent slope at 5,510 feet elevation.  (The profile was moist throughout when described on July 20, 1988.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Freels series.  Freels soils lack carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mooretown soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,300 feet.  The soil formed in mixed alluvium.  The climate is cold and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackfoot, Borah, Borco and Darlington series.  Blackfoot soils are on flood plains and have fine-loamy particle-size control sections.  Borah and Borco soils are on flood plains and stream terraces and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Darlington soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Drained phases are well drained.  Slow runoff.  Permeability is moderate throughout with some pedons moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  Rare or occasional flooding for brief periods during spring months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mooretown soils are used for irrigated cropland, hayland, and pastureland.  They are also used for nonirrigated pastureland, rangeland and homesites.  The major crops are alfalfa, wheat, barley and potatoes.  The native vegetation in undrained areas is willows, woods rose, sedges and mountain brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  This series is not extensive.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 27 inches (A1, A2, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)

The Bk horizon lacks sufficient carbonate accumulation to qualify as a calcic horizon.

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk2 and Bk3 horizons and part of the 2Bg horizon)
