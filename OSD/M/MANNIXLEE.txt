MANNIXLEE SERIES

The Mannixlee series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils occur on stream terraces, depressions and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Mannixlee clay loam, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed organic matter. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A1--2 to 9 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; common medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular and discontinuous irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.

    A2--9 to 16 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores and many very fine discontinuous irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.

    A3--16 to 25 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; common medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores, and few very fine and fine discontinuous irregular pores; neutral; (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons - 21 to 35 inches)

    Bw--25 to 45 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; many medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores, and common very fine and fine discontinuous irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (19 to 35 inches thick)

    2Cg--45 to 60 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel and 35 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2). (6 to 35 inches thick)
