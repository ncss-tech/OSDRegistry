MONTELL SERIES

The Montell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on valley sides or valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to about 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).

Texture is silty clay or clay throughout with total clay content of 40 to 60 percent. 
Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to more than 40 percent in some horizon within 102 cm (40 in) of the soil surface.
Calcium carbonate equlivant ranges from 10 to 40 percent throughout.
Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline throughout. 
When dry, cracks 1 to more than 5 cm (0.4 to more than 2 in) wide at the surface extend to a depth of 31 cm (12 in) or more. Cracks open 150 to 210 cumulative days during most years.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform: valley sides or valley floors
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual temperature: 21 to 23 degrees C (69 to 74 degrees F)

Precipitation Pattern: June to August and December to February are the driest months,while September to November and March to May are the wettest months.
Frost-free period: 240 to 310 days.

Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 20 to 30.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caid, Catarina, Knippa, and the Uvalde series. 
Caid soils: are in a fine-loamy family, have an argillic horizon, and are on slightly higher positions.
Catarina soils: have higher SARs closer to the surface and on similar positions. 
Knippa and Uvalde soils: have a calcic horizon and are on similar to slightly lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high on 1 to 3 percent slopes. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is cracked, but very slow when the soil is moist and cracks are closed.

USE AND VEGETATION: Largely used for native rangeland and wildlife habitat. Range vegetation consists mainly of fourflower trichloris, alkali sacaton, tobosa, vine mesquite, curlymesquite, white tridens, whiplash pappusgrass and other short and midgrasses. Nonsaline areas produce pink pappusgrass, sideoats grama, and buffalograss also. Invading plants include scrubby mesquite, whitebush, and pricklypear. The ecological site is Clay Flat 18-25 PZ (R083BY415TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western and Central Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I, MLRA 83B and 83C. The series is of large extent (about 571,000 acres correlated).
