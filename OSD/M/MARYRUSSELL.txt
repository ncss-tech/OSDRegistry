MARYRUSSELL SERIES

The Maryrussell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous mineralogy. Maryrussell soils are on paleoterraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Maryrussell soils form in a plateau climate.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Maryrussell gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arnor, Arwite, Augustine, Bigbow, Bosonoak, Carri, Celacy, Celavar, Dalhart, Deekay, Dermala, Elwop, Evpark, Flugle, Fort Collins, Gateson, Iwela, Lykorly, Navajita, Nyjack, Oldwolf, Olnest, Orlie, Parkelei, Pinitos, Rauzi, Ribera, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soil series'.  
Arnor, Arwite, Augustine, Deekay, Dermala, Elwop, Fort Collins, Gateson, Oldwolf, Olnest, Nyjack, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils form in interior mountain climates that have a colder mean annual temperature.  
Bigbow, and Dalhart soils form in prairie climates that have a warmer mean annual temperature.  
Bosonoak, Carri, Celacy, Celavar, Evpark, Flugle, and Lykorly soils do not have gravelly and very gravelly textures. 
Iwela soils form in colluvium from landslides.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maryrussell soils are at elevations of 5,900 to 6,800 feet on hills. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and basalt. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 54 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches and occurs as thunderstorms in July, August and September and as rain and snow in the winter. The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Maryrussell soils appear in an alluvial setting similar to Disterheff soils, but Disterheff soils have more clay in all horizons.  Ashfork, Dogpaws, and Cross soils are derived from surrounding basalt lava flows.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for livestock grazing. Vegetation is mainly blue grama, black grama, broom snakeweed, cholla, green rabbitbrush, low woollygrass, oneseed juniper, pricklypear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. The soils are moderately extensive. MLRA is 35.
