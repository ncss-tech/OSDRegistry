MCCHORD SERIES

The McChord series consists of deep to a densic contact, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial drift. McChord soils are on glacially modified hills and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,143 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Oxyaquic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: McChord gravelly sandy loam - forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(10 to 50 cm thick).

   Cd--119 to 150 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) extremely gravelly loamy sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3), moist; massive; very hard, very firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots in cracks; few very fine irregular pores; 5 percent dark light gray (2.5Y 7/1), and dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), moist, iron depletions and 10 percent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6), moist, iron-manganese masses; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on drift plains and moraines at elevations of 110 to 160 meters. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in dense glacial drift. McChord soils are in a cool marine climate. The summers are cool and dry, and the winters are mild and wet. The mean annual precipitation is 762 to 1,270 millimeters, most of which falls as rain from November through March. The mean January temperature is 2 degrees C, mean July temperature is 24 degrees C, and mean annual temperature is 9 about degrees C. The frost free period is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alderwood, Everett, and Indianola series. Alderwood soils have a densic layer within 100 cm. Everett soils are sandy-skeletal and very deep. Indianola soils are very deep and sandy throughout.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to the densic contact and very low below.  A perched water table is as high as 60 to 119 cm at times from January through March. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for woodland, hay and pasture, orchards, wildlife habitat, watershed, and non-farm uses. The native vegetation is Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, and red alder with an understory of salal, Oregon-grape, western brackenfern, western swordfern, Pacific rhododendron,  red huckleberry, evergreen huckleberry, and orange honeysuckle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Washington; MLRA 2. The series is of moderate extent.
