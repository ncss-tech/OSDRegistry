MARIANO SERIES

The Mariano series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material from sandstone over coarse alluvium derived from igneous sources.  Mariano soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Dera (UT) series.  The Dera soils form in alluvium and lake sediments and lack a discontinuity in parent material. In addition, Dera soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B) and have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian material from sandstone over alluvium from igneous sources
Landform:  fan remnants
Slopes:  1 to 6 percent
Elevation:  4,800 to 5,700 feet
Mean annual temperature: 52 to 56 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 7 to 10 inches
Precipitation pattern: Uniform with slight dip in May and June and slight increase in July and August.
Frost-free period: 135 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mack, and Bluechief series.  The Mack soils formed in eolian and are on remnant terraces and mesas.  The Bluechief soils moderately deep to hard sandstone and are on mesas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low runoff, medium permeability,

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and irrigated cropland.  Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, galleta, and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado; MLRA 35; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Montezuma County, Colorado, Ute Mountain Area, Colorado and New Mexico, 2005.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Series control section: The zone from 0 to 79 inches.

Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (2Bk1, 2Bk2, 2Bkn horizons)

Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizons)

Calcic horizon: The zone from 11 to 51 inches.  (2Bk1, 2Bk2, 2Bkn horizons)

Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bk1 horizon. The contact between eolian and alluvial material.

Other features: Some areas approach cementation strengths of petrocalcic horizons, but are not consistent over the area.
