MOCKLEY SERIES

The Mockley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Willis Formation. These very gently sloping soils occur on low hills on coastal plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  Base saturation in the epipedon and subsoil are less than 50 percent throughout.  Base saturation at 125 cm (50 in) below the top of the argillic (Bt) horizon ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, yellow, brown or grays are considered relict from a past climate or due to abnormally wet periods.

Soil Moisture: An udic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section, 10 to 31 cm (4 to 12 in), is typically moist from September to July in most years.  The cumulative total number of days the soil moisture control section is dry is less than 90 days.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Colorado County, Texas, 1997.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 38 to 89 cm (15 to 35 in).  (Bt, Btv1, and Btv2 horizon)
Umbric epipedon: 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in).  (A1 and A2 horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 38 to 203 cm (15 to 80 in) (Bt, Btv1, Btv2, B't1, and B't2 horizons)
Other features: 
Pale feature: Does not have a clay decrease with increasing depth of 20 percent or more (relative) from the maximum clay content

Plinthite comprises 5 to 20 percent by volume of the Btv horizons

Additional Comments: The series was updated in January 2001 as a part of the MLRA 150A update. Classification was changed from thermic to hyperthermic during update of January 2001 due to results of a soil temperature study. Classification change, dated September 1997, from Clayey, mixed, thermic Plinthic Paleudults to Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic Paledults based on advances in soil taxonomy (Clayey no longer used in Ultisols), and results from reference sampling of three pedons from Austin County, Texas.  This soil was formerly included in the Hockley series.
