MINU SERIES

The Minu series consists of shallow, well drained soils over a very strongly cemented duripan. Minu soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Minu soils are on eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

REMARKS:  This soil was reclassified from frigid to mesic in 1990. In 2009 the type location was relocated and the soil reclassified to better reflect landscape characteristics; the classification changed from haploxeralfic to xeric.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 cm (A horizon).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 4 to 40 cm (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons).
Duripan - The zone from 40 to 110 cm (Bqkm1 and Bqkm2 horizons).
Indurated duripan- The zone from 70 to 110 cm (Bqkm2 horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 40 cm (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons).
