MADGE SERIES

The Madge series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level or very gently sloping soils are on treads of stream terraces on allurvial plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Argiustolls

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abilene, Shrewder, St. Paul, and Woodward series.  
Abilene soils: These soils have a fine particle-size control section and occur on similar areas.
Shrewder soils: These soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section, have a cambic horizon, and usually occur on side slopes or convex areas.
St. Paul soils: These soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section, have mollic surfaces more than 20 inches thick and occur on broad upland plains.
Woodward soils: These soils have an ochric epipedon, are less than 40 inches deep over sandstone and occur on higher landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is low  on 0 to 1 percent slopes and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mainly cultivated.  Cotton, wheat, alfalfa, and grain sorghum are the principal crops.  Native vegetation consists of mid and tall grasses.
