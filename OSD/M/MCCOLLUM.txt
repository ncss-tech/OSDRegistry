MCCOLLUM SERIES

The McCollum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  McCollum fine sandy loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--7 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual boundary.

    Bw2--17 to 29 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw1 and Bw2 horizons is 10 to 24 inches)

    Bw3--29 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; neutral (pH 7.2)
