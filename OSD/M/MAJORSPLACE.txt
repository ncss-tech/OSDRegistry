MAJORSPLACE SERIES

The Majorsplace series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from quartzite with admixtures of calcareous loess. The Majorsplace soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Majorsplace soils are on backslopes of mountains. 
These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from quartzite with admixtures of calcareous loess, dominantly added when the Pleistocene lakes were drying up. 
Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. 
Elevations are 1,850 to 2,380 meters. 
The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. 
The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm. 
The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.
The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Checkett, Grube, and Tractuff series. 
Checkett soils are mesic.
Grube soils are very deep and have a mollic epipedon is 25 to 38 cm thick.
Tractuff soils have a mollic epipedon and 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or high runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Majorsplace soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly, Indian ricegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, black sagebrush, and a few old Utah juniper and singleleaf pinyon. This site is correlated to Ecological Site R28AY102NV, Shallow Calcareous Hill 10-14" P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East central Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
