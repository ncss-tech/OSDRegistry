MUMMY SERIES

The Mummy series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss and schist.  Mummy soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, micaceous Typic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mummy extremely cobbly sandy loam , on a south facing, convex, 27 percent slope in tundra at an elevation of 12,335 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 5, 1996 the soil was moist from 0 to 60 inches. The surface is covered by 5 percent boulders, 15 percent stones, and 30 percent cobbles.

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely cobbly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout and common medium; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout and few medium; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 20 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw2--24 to 72 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout and few medium; 20 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.2).  (30 to 62 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Archrock series. Other series that may be competitors when reclassified are the Afley, Causewa, Drakespeak, Hossick, McCall, Moran, and Sibelia series.  
Archrock soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  
Afley and Causewa soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. 
Drakespeak soils have a xeric moisture regime.  
McCall soils have mean annual soil temperature higher than 36 degrees and are assumed to have a xeric moisture regime.
Moran soils have less than 25 percent mica.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist
Landform:  mountain 
Slopes:  10 to 60 percent
Elevation:  10,400 to 12,200 feet
Mean annual temperature:  34 to 38 degrees F

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountains of the northcentral Rocky Mountains, Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; this series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Larimer County, Colorado, Rocky Mountain National Park Soil Survey Area, 1999.  The name is taken from the mountain range.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Umbric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 24 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 24 to 60 inches.  (Bw horizon)
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (part of the A2 and the Bw horizons)

Remarks:  Previously recognized as the Moran series but was changed due the high mica content and thick solum.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998.


The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
