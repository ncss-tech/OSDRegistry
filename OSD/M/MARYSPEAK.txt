MARYSPEAK SERIES

The Maryspeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy colluvium in ancient landslide deposits derived from a mixture of coarse-grained intrusive igneous rocks and sandstone. Maryspeak soils occur on summits, backslopes, and footslopes of mountains. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 135 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Benton County, Oregon, 2004. The name is taken from Marys Peak in western Benton County, the highest point in the Coast Range Mountains of Oregon. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).
Cambic horizon - from 13 to 34 inches (Bw horizon).
Andic subgroup feature - from the mineral soil surface to 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons). Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties. 

Particle-size control section (Sandy-skeletal family) - from 12 to 42 inches (1 inch of the BA horizon, Bw1 horizon, and 8 inches of the BC horizon). 

Depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon. 

Classification revision 12/01 from loamy-skeletal, isotic Andic Dystrocryepts to sandy-skeletal, isotic Andic Dystrocryepts based on lab data and associated soils.
