MANO SERIES 

The Mano series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on hills.  These soils formed in colluvial sediments from cherty limestone and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over clayey, mixed, semiactive, mesic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mano very gravelly silt loam, very stony, on a 7 percent southwest facing slope in mixed hardwood forest at an elevation of 1,130 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Oi--0 to 1 inch; partly decomposed leaves, roots, and twigs.  (0 to 1 inches thick) 

   A--1 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and dark gray (10YR 4/1) very gravelly silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; strong very fine granular structure; very friable; many medium roots; 30 percent chert gravel and 10 percent chert cobbles; stone size fragments cover about 3 percent of the surface; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 10 inches thick) 

   E--4 to 9 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly silt loam; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; common coarse roots; 30 percent chert gravel and 10 percent chert cobbles; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 11 inches thick) 

   EB--9 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly silt loam; weak very fine granular structure; friable; common coarse roots; 30 percent chert gravel and 10 percent chert cobbles; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick) 

   Bt1--14 to 22 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly silt loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent chert gravel and 5 percent chert cobbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. 

   Bt2--22 to 34 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly silty clay loam; common medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) mottles; weak very fine angular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent chert gravel; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 6 to 30 inches.) 

   2Bt3--34 to 69 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay; common medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation and common fine prominent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; weak very fine angular blocky structure; very firm; few fine roots; few fine rounded black iron and manganese concretions; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent chert gravel; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Barry County, Missouri.  About 1.5 miles west of the Barry-Stone county line just north of the Missouri-Arkansas state line, or 250 feet south and 2,130 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 26, T. 21 N., R. 25 W; Viola USGS quadrangle, latitude 36 degrees 55 minutes 07 seconds N. and 93 degrees 14 minutes 14 seconds W.. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock: greater than 60 inches
Depth to 2Bt horizon: 7 to 40 inches
Surface Cover: 0 to 3 percent stones
Note: Rock fragment content in the A, E, and Bt horizons ranges from 15 to 80 percent, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, and is less than 35 percent in the 2Bt horizon.
Note: Some pedons have clay depletions with chroma of 2 or less at depths of more than 10 inches below the top of the Bt horizon.

A or Ap horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Fine-earth: silt loam or loam
Reaction: very strongly acid to neutral
Note: If value and chroma are less than 3.5 moist, the A horizon is less than 7 inches thick.

E or EB horizons
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 6
Chroma: 2 to 6
Fine-earth: silt loam or loam
Reaction: very strongly acid to neutral

Bt horizon
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 8
Fine-earth: silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam
Reaction: very strongly acid to slightly acid

2Bt horizon
Hue: 2.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 2 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 8
Fine-earth: clay or silty clay
Reaction: very strongly acid to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Ocie series.  Ocie soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mano soils are on ridges, benches, and side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in colluvial sediments from cherty limestone and the underlying residuum weathered from cherty dolomite and interbedded shales.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Ocie soils and the Bardley, Gasconade, Gatewood, and Moko soils.  These soils all have bedrock at depths of less than 60 inches and generally are on similar landscape positions.  The Gasconade and Moko soils also have mollic epipedons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Runoff potential is low to high.  Permeability is slow and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. A seasonal water table is in the lower Bt or upper 2Bt horizons for brief periods in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: More than half the acreage is in second-growth timber.  Principal species include oak, hickory, ash, maple, and dogwood.  Tame grasses grown for hay or pasture occupy most of the remaining acres.  A few small scattered plots are used for gardens and truck cropping or are in subdivisions.  Native vegetation is deciduous hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozark region (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of Missouri and possibly Arkansas and Tennessee.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Barry County, Missouri soil survey; 1989. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 14 inches (Oi, A, E and EB horizons).
Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 14 inches to 69 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons). 
Oxyaquic feature - redoximorphic properties within 40 inches of the surface.
