MARISSA SERIES

The Marissa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or poorly drained soils formed in silty material on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Argiaquic Argialbolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Marissa silt loam, in a cultivated field on a stream terrace at an elevation of about 116 meters (380 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [25 to 36 cm (10 to 14 inches) thick]

 Eg--30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam; weak medium platy structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. [10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) thick]

 BEg--46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; firm; many distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely weakly cemented iron-manganese masses in the matrix; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) thick]

 Btg1--56 to 89 cm (22 to 35 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky; firm; common distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay films; common fine distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of extremely weakly cemented iron-manganese masses; few medium prominent black (10YR 2/1) iron-manganese concretions; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

 Btg2--89 to 109 cm (35 to 43 inches); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay films; many fine and medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) extremely weakly cemented iron-manganese masses; many medium distinct black (10YR 2/1) iron-manganese concretions; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 51 to 89 cm (20 to 35 inches).]

 C1--109 to 127 cm (43 to 50 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) and light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam; massive; friable; slightly alkaline. [13 cm or greater (5 inches to several feet) thick]

 C2--127 to 152 cm (50 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam; massive; friable; many yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Gallatin County, Illinois; about 3 miles northwest of Ridgway; 1,740 feet north and 150 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 11, T. 8 S., R. 8 E.; USGS Ridgway, Illinois topographic quadrangle; lat. 37 degrees 50 minutes 24 seconds N. and long. 88 degrees 16 minutes 56 seconds W.; UTM Zone 16, 387184 easting and 4188852 northing, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corley, Ebbert, Edgington, Knight, Normal, Speed, Thorp, and Vesser series. Corley, Ebbert, Normal, and Vesser soils do not have carbonates within the depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Edgington and Speed soils are more than 61 cm (24 inches) to the top of the argillic horizon. Knight soils have compete closely on soil properties and differentiae need to be more clearly defined. Typically, Knight soils are in cool, mesic regions and have lower mean annual air and soil temperatures, although currently the ranges overlap. Thorp soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marissa soils are on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in loess or loess-like materials of Wisconsin Age. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 101 to 113 mm (41 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The most common close geographic associates are the poorly drained or very poorly drained Patton soils which do not have albic horizons and the somewhat poorly Reesville soils which do not have mollic epipedons. Associated soils on nearby landscapes are in the well drained Camden, somewhat poorly drained Starks, and moderately well drained Uniontown soils which do not have mollic epipedons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly or poorly drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from at the surface to a depth of 46 cm (1.5 feet) in spring. Potential for surface runoff is low. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. Native vegetation is prairie grass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 113 and 115A in southern Illinois. The series is of moderate extent.
