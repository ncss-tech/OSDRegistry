MAGDALENA SERIES

The Magdalena series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rocks and sediments.  Magdalena soils are on bajadas.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Magdalena soils are on bajadas.  Slopes range from 3 to l2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5500 to 6300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is l0 to l3 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is l45 to l65 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Millett, Puertecito and Sedillo soils.  Millett is fine loamy.  Puertecito is loamy-skeletal and has a lithic contact within 20 inches.  Sedillo is loamy skeletal and has a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; very slowly permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Magdalena soils are used for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation includes black grama, blue grama, sideoats grama, threeawns, juniper and broom snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Magdalena soils are of small extent in central New Mexico. MLRA 35.
