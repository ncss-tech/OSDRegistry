MARSHAN SERIES

The Marshan series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash.  Marshan soils are on plane or slightly concave positions along narrow drainageways on outwash plains, valley trains, and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Marshan silty clay loam, on a plane slope on a terrace along a small stream in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 25 centimeters; black (N 2/0) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak very fine granular structure; slightly sticky; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (17 to 29 centimeters thick)

Thickness of the mollic epipedon--30 to 60 centimeters
Depth to the sandy and gravelly outwash--50 to 100 centimeters

Some pedons, in uncultivated areas, have an O horizon up to 11 centimeters thick

Ap or A horizon:
Hue--10YR to 5Y, or is neutral
Value--2 or 3
Chroma--0 to 2
Texture--silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or loam
Clay content--18 to 35 percent
Sand content--10 to 55 percent
Rock fragment content--0 to 5 percent
Reaction--moderately acid to neutral

Bg horizon:
Hue--7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value--4 to 6

Sand content--15 to 55 percent
Rock fragment content--0 to 5 percent
Reaction--moderately acid to neutral

The 7.5YR and 10YR hues, and higher value and chroma is thought to be indicative of a high content of hydrated iron oxides

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--very poorly or poorly drained--these soils have a saturated zone between depths of 0.0 to 0.3 meter during March to June when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation and this saturation is considered apparent

USE AND VEGETATION:
Where undrained, the principal use is pasture. Where adequately drained, Marshan soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and small grains are principal crops. Native vegetation is a wet-site community of the tall grass prairie. See Additional Data section for native vegetative cover in Iowa and Minnesota.

aquic suborder--5Y 4/1 matrix color in the zone from a depth of 46 to 58 centimeters (Bg1 horizon).

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
