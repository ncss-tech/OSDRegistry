MONAD SERIES

The Monad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and outwash derived mainly from argillite, sandstone and quartzite.  These soils occur on alluvial fans, hills, ground moraines and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Alfic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Monad gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 9 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; 15 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick)

    A2--9 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; very thin continuous gray (10YR 6/1) skeletans coating faces of peds; 15 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt/E--14 to 21 inches; Bt part (80 percent) brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; E part (20 percent) gray (10YR 6/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; very thin continuous gray (10YR 6/1) skeletans coating continuous faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent sandstone channers; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 17 inches thick)

    Bt1--21 to 49 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium blocky; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; very thin gray (10YR 6/1) skeletans coating continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent sandstone channers; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 28 inches thick)

    Bt2--49 to 74 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) stony clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; strong fine and medium blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES:
Anvik (CO) - does not have a glossic horizon
Bear basin (UT) - have greater than 35 percent rock fragments below the argillic horizon
Buffork (WY) - are moderately deep to a paralithic contact
Slipman (WY) - are deep to a lithic contact 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - alluvial fans, hills, ground moraines and mountains
Elevation - 4,600 to 8,100 feet
Slope - 2 to 60 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium, colluvium and outwash derived mainly from argillite, sandstone and quartzite
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 24 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Libeg, Loggert, and Tigeron soils. These soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Loggert and Tigeron soils lack a mollic epipedon.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Monad soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Richardson needlegrass, mountain brome, forbs and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Monad soils are of moderate extent in west-central Montana and Colorado. MLRAs - 43B, 46, 48A.
