MARSHDALE SERIES

The Marshdale series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Marshdale soils are on flood plains and drainageways, and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. Permeability is moderate. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Marshdale loam on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 5,000 feet in cultivated cropland. When described in July 1967, the profile was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick) 

  A--7 to 20 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 16 inches thick) 

  Bg1--20 to 33 inches; dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) loam, very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) moist; few fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) redox concentrations, which are dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick) 

  Bg2--33 to 47 inches; gray (2.5Y 5/1) sandy clay loam, very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) moist; few fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) redox concentrations, which are dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 16 inches thick) 

  2Cg1--47 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; few redox concentrations; single grain; soft, very friable; 10 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick) 

  2Cg2--60 to 65 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marshdale soils occur on nearly level bottomlands or gently sloping alluvial fans at elevations of 4,800 to 6,700 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains. The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 100 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brinegar, Hapur, Hutton, Picabo, and Strom soils. Brinegar soils have an argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Hapur soils are calcareous to the surface. Hutton soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Picabo soils are somewhat poorly drained. Strom soils have argillic horizons. Brinegar and Picabo soils occur on stream terraces. Hapur, Hutton, and Strom soils occur in bottomlands and on flood plains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; slow or very slow runoff; and moderate permeability. The water table fluctuates between 0.5 to 1.5 feet. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pasture. Some is used for small grains without irrigation. The natural vegetation is chiefly sedges, rushes, grasses, silver sagebrush, and willows. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central and southeastern Idaho. The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Meade County, South Dakota, 1974. 

REMARKS: This series type location was originally in Colorado. It was established in South Dakota in the South Meade County Survey. It was never mapped in Colorado, and South Dakota has only very limited acreage of this soil. The type location was transferred to Idaho in 1980. Idaho has about 20,000 acres of this soil. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are: 
Mollic epipedon - zone from the soil surface to approximately 47 inches (Ap, A, Bg1, and Bg2 horizons) 
Soils have aquic moisture regime 
Soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth 
Particle - size control section - 10 to 40 inches (parts of A2, Bg1, and Bg2 horizon)
