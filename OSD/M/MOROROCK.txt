MOROROCK SERIES

The Mororock series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium  and residuum derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks. The Mororock soils are on mountain slopes and canyon walls of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Ultic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Mororock gravelly loam on a southwest-facing (225 degree), 80 percent slope under a cover of flannel bush, mountain mahogany, and poison oak at an elevation of 1340 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on June 17, 1983 the soil was dry throughout.)

 Oe--0 to 3 cm; moderately decomposed plant material. (0 to 5 cm thick)

 A--3 to 30 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; 42 percent sand; 46 percent silt; 13 percent clay; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky, slightly plastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 30 percent angular mica schist gravel and cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 35 cm thick)

 AB--30 to 50 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; 45 percent sand; 48 percent silt; 13 percent clay; weak medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 30 percent angular mica schist gravel and cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

 Bw--50 to 103 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; 49 percent sand; 41 percent silt; 10 percent clay; weak coarse angular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine and few medium tubular pores; 30 percent angular mica schist gravel and cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (40 to 65 cm thick)

 C--103 to 153 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; structureless massive.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mororock soils are on steep linear to concave drainages of mountain slopes and canyon walls. Slopes range from 10 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or granitic rocks. Elevation is 745 to 2215 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 730 to 1070 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 9 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 150 to 255 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Edencreek and Grunigen soils. Edencreek soils are on convex backslopes of mountain slopes, and have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. The Grunigen soils are on linear to concave drainageways on mountain slopes, have a mollic epipedon, and are 50 cm to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well to somewhat excessively drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is canyon live oak, alderleaf mountain mahogany, poison oak, flannel bush, and annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
