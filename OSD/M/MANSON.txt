MANSON SERIES

The Manson series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy sediments derived from the upper part of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on gently to moderately sloping interfluves or broad erosion remnants.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (18 in) and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

Mansic and Plemons soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Ady and Alibates soils: are on similar landscape positions and have more than 15 percent by weight fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section and do not have a calcic horizon within 60 cm.
Berda and Paloduro soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and do not have a argillic horizon.
Bippus and Sprone soils: are on lower landscape positions and do not have an argillic horizon or have a calcic horizon within 60 cm.
Mobeetie and Veal soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions and have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section; in addition Veal soils have carbonatic mineralogy.
Potter soils: are on similar landscape positions and have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderate permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1, low 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soil is primarily used for livestock grazing.  The vegetation is short and mid-grasses, mainly gramas and buffalograss and a few woody plants including catclaw and mesquite.  Where cultivated, the principle crops are grain sorghum, small grain, and forage crops.  This soil has been correlated to the Limey Upland (R-077EY057TX) ecological site in MLRA-77E.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA-77E, LRR H) of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.  The series is of moderate extent.
