MCNEAL SERIES 

The McNeal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from volcanic, granitic and limestone rock. McNeal soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Calciargids

Chroma: 2 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Texture: loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy loam (averages 20 to 35 percent clay)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amarose (NM), Grizzle (AZ), Gulch (AZ), Headquarters (NM), McAllister (AZ), Redona (NM), and Tinney (NM) series. Amarose and Redona soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.

Amarose, Redona, Tinney, and McAllister soils have calcic horizons below 20 inches.

Headquarters soils have a solum that is 10 to 15 inches thick.

Gulch soils have 1 to 4 percent gypsum.

Grizzle soils are moderately deep to paralithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McNeal soils are in the Chihuahuan desert on gently sloping to sloping fan terraces at elevations of 3,000 to 5,200 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from rhyolite, andesite, granite, and limestone. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains. The mean annual air temperature is about 59 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 250 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bonita, Forrest and Luckyhills series. Bonita soils are fine textured. Forrest soils are fine textured and have greater than 1 percent organic matter. Luckyhills soils have less than 18 percent clay and do not have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and irrigated cropland. Vegetation is whitethorn, tarbush, creosotebush, bush muhly, plains bristlegrass, desert zinnia and mariola. Irrigated crops are cotton, corn, small grains and alfalfa. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Arizona. McNeal soils are moderately extensive. MLRA is 41.
