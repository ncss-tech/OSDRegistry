MAURICANYON SERIES

The Mauricanyon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary materials.  Mauricanyon soils are on flood plains and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mauricanyon loam, on a north facing, level, 1 percent slope in grass at an elevation of 6,760 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 8, 1973 the soil was moist from 0 to 72 inches.

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--3 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very coarse platy structure parting to weak medium subangular blocks; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 6 to 16 inches)

    Bw--8 to 25 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (9 to 24 inches thick)

    Bk--25 to 72 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium soft masses of lime; violently effervescent (4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bon (SD), Frazwell (AZ), Humbarger (KS), Lynx (AZ), Manzano (NM), Maskell (NE), Merrick (NE), Pack (UT), Shanta (NM), St. Onge (SD) and Umbarg (CO) series.
Bon soils: do not have Bw horizons and are calcareous at depths of 6 to 20 inches.
Frazwell soils: are dry in May and June.
Humbarger soils: have free carbonates above a depth of 10 inches.
Lynx soils: are dry in May and June.
Manzano soils: are dry April through June.
Maskell soils: do not have carbonates above a depth of 40 inches.
Merrick soils: do not have carbonates above a depth of 40 inches.  
Pack soils: are somewhat poorly drained.
Shanta soils: average 5 to 20 percent rock fragments in the control section.
St. Onge soils: are calcareous above a depth of 20 inches.
Umbarg soils: are calcareous throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Alluvium derived from sedimentary deposits.
Landform:  Terraces, flood plains, and drainageways
Slopes:  0 to 4 percent

Mean annual temperature:  47 to 53 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 17 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Capulin, La Brier, Sitcan, and Trementina series.  The Capulin and Sitcan soils have argillic horizons and are on fans.  The La Brier soils average more than 35 percent clay in the control section and are on terraces and swales.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland, cropland, hay and pasture, wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is blue grama, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, fringed sagewort, galleta, and perennial forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico; LRR E and G, MLRA's 49, 67, 70 and 70; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County Area soil survey area, Colorado, 2007.  The name is coined from Mauricio Canyon.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Part of the Bw and Bk horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 72 inches.  (A1, A2, Bw and Bk horizons)
Other features:  secondary calcium carbonate. (Bk horizon)

This series replaces the Manzano series in Las Animas County, Colorado, and in Colfax and Union Counties in New Mexico. These areas average more than 14 inches annual precipitation and are moist during periods that are typically dry as described in the Manzano series. In addition, the Manzano series identified several species that typically grow on alkaline soils in the vegetation section.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
