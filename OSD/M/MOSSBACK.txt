MOSSBACK SERIES

The Mossback series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy till overlying sandy glaciofluvial deposits on end moraines and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs

[0 to 58 cm (23 inches)]

 C--112 to 188 cm (44 to 74 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam; massive; friable; few prominent very pale brown (10YR 7/3) carbonate coatings on faces of peds and few fine carbonate masses; 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bamfield, Neckrock, Pecore, and Tilleda series. The Bamfield soils average more than 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Neckrock soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Pecore and Tilleda soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 89 cm (35 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mossback soils are on end moraines and ground moraines of late Wisconsinan Age. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mossback soils formed in loamy till overlying sandy glaciofluvial deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bamfield, Blue Lake, Mancelona, and Menominee soils. The Bamfield, Blue Lake, and Menominee soils and the excessively drained Mancelona soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on the slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The less sloping areas are in rotational cropping of corn, hay, oats, and wheat. The steeper areas are in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is dominantly American basswood, American beech, black cherry, ironwood, red maple, sugar maple, and white ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
