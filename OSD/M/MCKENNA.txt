06/2018-Changed from previous classification of loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Aquandic Epiaquepts. Existing laboratory data for this series and other geographically associated soils does not reflect the presence of adequate quantities of volcanic glass to support the Aquandic subgroup. The official series description was edited according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017).
