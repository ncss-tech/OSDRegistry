COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dumont and Pollard soils.  Dumont soils are dry for 45 to 60 days in the particle size control section.  Pollard soils are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the particle size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marjonmine soils are on mountainflanks of mountain slopes. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from schist. Elevation is 853 to 1036 meters (2800 to 3400 feet). Mean annual precipitation is 914 to 1143 mm (36 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C (47 to 49 degrees F). Frost-free season ranges from 150 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Andihasset, Lickinfork, and Schaad soils.  Andihasset soils have andic properties and are on side slopes of broad tabular ridges and volcanic erosion remnants. Lickinfork soils are loamy-skeletal and are on mountainflanks of mountain slopes. Schaad soils are fine-loamy and are on mountainflanks of mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.
