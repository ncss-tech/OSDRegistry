MATNEFLAT SERIES

The Matneflat series consists of very deep, well drained, soils with moderately rapid permeability on uplands. The soils formed in colluvium from sandstone and shale on fans, footslopes, lower mountain ridgetops, and mountain sideslopes. Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Typic Paleudults 

TYPICAL PEDON: Matneflat gravelly sandy loam, very stony - on a 22 percent slope in an area of mixed hardwoods and pines. (Colors are for moist soil.) 

  Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed leaves, needles, and twigs. 

  A--2 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam; weak, fine and medium granular structure; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; many fine, medium and coarse roots; 25 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick) 

  Bt1--6 to 23 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common fine, medium and coarse roots; sand grains bridged and coated with clay; 10 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

  Bt2--23 to 40 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) sandy loam; common fine faint reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/8) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structures; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; sand grains bridged and coated with clay; 10 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

  Bt3--40 to 64 inches; mottled yellowish red (5YR 5/8), red (2.5YR 4/8), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), gravelly coarse sandy loam; weak, medium, subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; sand grains bridged and coated with clay; 30 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly acid. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 58 inches or more) 

TYPE LOCATION: Wythe County, Virginia; 0.77 miles southeast of the junction of highways VA-640 and VA-720, and 1.5 miles southwest of the junction of highways VA-720 and VA-649. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness: Solum is greater than 60 inches. 
Depth to rock: more than 60 inches to hard bedrock. 
Rock fragments: 0 to 35 percent in A, Ap, and upper Bt; 15 to 50 percent in lower Bt, BC,and C horizons. Sandstone gravel, cobbles, stones, and boulders. 
Reaction: Extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Zepp series in the same family and the Brockwell soils. Zepp soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick. Brockwell soils have an active CEC class and formed in colluvium over residuum in the Ozark Highlands and have a moisture deficit of 2 to 4 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Matneflat soils are on gently sloping to very steep fans, foot slopes, mountain side slopes, and lower mountain ridgetops in the Blue Ridge and Ridge and Valley physiographic provinces. The soils formed in colluvium weathered from sandstone and some shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 36 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 48 to 55 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Berks, Clymer, Dekalb, Lily, Ramsey, Rayne, and Shelocta soils. Berks, Clymer, Dekalb, Lily, Ramsey and Rayne are on residual positions at higher elevations. Shelocta soils are on similar colluvial positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; runoff is medium to very rapid; permeability is moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are wooded, but less steep areas are used for crops and pasture. Native forests have upland oaks, red and sugar maple, hickory, yellow poplar, Virginia pine and white pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Valley and ridge and Appalachian Plateau physiographic provinces of Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wythe County, Virginia, 1989. 

REMARKS: These soils have previously been mapped as Jefferson, Nolichucky, Drall, and Rigley. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: A. Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon) B. Argillic horizon-the zone from 4 to 62 inches (Bt horizon) 

MLRA = 128, 130 SIR = VA0109 (STONY), VA0110 REVISED 3/28/89 

The 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement may have been based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.

2/2022 revision: Oi had 2 to 0 inch depths, corrected to be 0 to 2 in horizon depths then added 2 inches to all horizon depths throughout the typical pedon. WJN

Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.
