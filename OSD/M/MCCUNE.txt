MCCUNE SERIES

The McCune series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  These soils are on low terraces and floodplains and have slope ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Aeric Glossaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  McCune silt loam - cultivated.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; few small gray concretions; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

   E1--7 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; few fine faint redoximorphic concentrations of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4); weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; few small gray concretions; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick)

   E2--16 to 25 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; common medium distinct redoximorphic concentrations of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4); weak medium subangular blocky structure that crushes easily to fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; common very fine pores; common fine gray concretions with yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) interiors; few small black concretions; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

   E/B--25 to 30 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, (E), light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; common medium distinct redoximorphic concentrations of brown (10YR 4/3) (Bt) that feel slightly more clayey than soil matrix; weak medium subangular blocky structure, hard, friable; few thin darker colored films on some ped surfaces; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

   Bt--30 to 46 inches; coarsely mottled grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry; weak medium blocky structure; hard, firm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) uncoated mineral grains on peds; thin patchy clay films; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

   BC--46 to 65 inches; coarsely mottled grayish brown (10YR 5/2), gray (10YR 5/1) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), gray (10YR 5/1) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; strongly acid; diffuse boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

   C--65 to 84 inches; coarsely mottled gray (10YR 5/1), dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silty clay loam, dry colors same; massive; hard, firm; common black stains; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Crawford County, Kansas; about 3 miles east and 1 mile north of intersection of Fourth and Broadway in Pittsburg; 700 feet east and 200 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 14, T. 30 S., R 25 E.

Matrix of the Bt and C horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  These horizons are coarsely mottled with colors of higher chroma and some with redder hue.  In many places mottles are so coarse and abundant that selection of a dominant color is not feasible. The difference in clay content between the E and Bt horizon is less than 15 percent  Texture and reaction of the C horizon is like that of the B horizon except that some pedons are stratified with thin layers or lenses or more sandy or more clayey texture.
