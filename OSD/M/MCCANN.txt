MCCANN SERIES

The McCann consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in coluvium derived from volcanic rocks. McCain soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Duridic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  McCann stony loam - rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

    A1--0 to 13 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) stony loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular and fine vesicular pores; 15 percent stones: neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    A2--13 to 23 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 50 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bw--23 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 50 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; few thin clay films in pores and bridging sand grains; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 33 cm thick)

    C--48 to 86 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots: many very fine tubular pores; 50 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 38 cm thick)

    Cq--86 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots many very fine tubular pores; 60 percent hard and firm durinodes that have few thin silica films in pores and are weakly cemented in pockets and seams; 50 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6) .

TYPE LOCATION: Nye County, Nevada; about 18 miles north of Tonopah, Nevada; 100 feet east and 0.5 mile south of the NW corner of sec. 6, T.5N., R.43E.; latitude 38 degrees 19 minutes 11 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 12 minutes 18 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry during the summer and autumn; xeric soil moisture regime bordering aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to durinodes: 46 to 75 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 7 to 18 percent. 
Rock fragment: 50 to 75 percent cobbles, gravel or stones.

A horizons 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Upper 18 cm has value less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist.
Structure:  Weak very fine or fine granular, subangular blocky structure or massive.
Consistence:  Soft or slightly hard.

Bw horizon 
Value:3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3.
Texture: Loam or fine sandy loam.
Modifiers: Very cobbly or extremely cobbly.
Structure: It has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky or weak coarse prismatic structure.

C horizon 
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture: Loam or fine sandy loam.
Modifiers: Very cobbly or extremely cobbly.
Consistence: Soft or slightly hard and very friable or friable.
Durinodes: Are slightly hard or hard and firm or very firm.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Rodie series. Rodie soils have a brittle matrix.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The McCann soils are on moderately steep and steep mountain slopes at elevations of 1,990 to 2,440 meters. Slope are 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, latite, and quartz-latite. The climate is cool continental with a mean annual precipitation of 250 to 360 mm, and a mean annual temperature of 7 to 8 degrees C. The frost-free season is about 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basket and Timblin soils.  Basket soils have argillic horizons and ochric epipedons. Timblin soils have ochric epipedons, argillic horizons, and duripans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well-drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife food and cover. The vegetation is principally big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, Webber ricegrass, Indian ricegrass, and juniper trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada. The series is inextensive.
