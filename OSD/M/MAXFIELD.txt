MAXFIELD SERIES

The Maxfield series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 60 to 102 centimeters of loess and underlying glacial till. Maxfield soils are on interfluves and on head slopes of broad, shallow drainageways on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 880 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bremer County, Iowa, 1965.

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (Ap, A, Bg, and 2Bw1 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A, Bg, 2Bw1, 2Bw2, and 2BC1 horizons);

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (Ap and A horizons); 
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 203 centimeters (Bg, 2Bw1, 2Bw2, 2BC1, and 2BC2 horizons); 
aquic suborder--2.5Y 4/2 color of matrix with redoximorphic concentrations in the zone from a depth of 48 to 74 centimeters (Bg horizon).

The particle-size class is bordering fine-loamy and is dependent on the depth to glacial till

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
