MEDICINELODGE SERIES

The Medicinelodge series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on flood-plain steps, stream terraces, drainageways, depressions and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Medicinelodge silt loam, in rangeland on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 2072 meters (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

 Oi--0 to 10 cm; slightly decomposed fibers and roots that texture to peat. (0 to 12 cm thick)

 A-- 10 to 32 cm; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium and fine granular structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

 Bw--32 to 46 cm; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; rigid, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 30 cm thick)

 Bg--46 to 67 cm; dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) clay, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; many medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; rigid, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 35 cm thick)

 Cg1--67 to 89 cm; dark greenish gray (10Y 4/1) clay loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; many medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) redox concentrations; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

 Cg2--89 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; many medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Beaverhead County, Montana; located about 1900 feet north and 500 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 9, T. 11S, R. 8W; Beech Creek topographic quadrangle; UTM 12T, 374291e, 4971989n, NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature - 1 to 4 degrees C.
Thickness of mollic epipedon - 18 to 49 cm

Linear extensibility percent - averages less than 6.0 between 0 to 100 cm

Note: The Bw horizon can be part of the mollic epipedon.  However, in this pedon it does not meet the rupture resistance requirement for a mollic epipedon.
