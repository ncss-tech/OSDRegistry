MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Calhoun County, South Carolina, 1993. 

REMARKS:
03/2009.  Revised the classification to Fluventic Endoaquepts according to criteria for cambic horizon in Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 10th edition, 2006.  Clay mineralogy is predominantly kaolinite, hydroxyl-interlayered vermiculite, and gibbsite.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 1 to 80 inches
Aquic conditions--the zone from 2 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation) 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: Characterization/Reference data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.: User Pedon ID (08SC085015) or Lab Pedon Number (08N0440) is representative of the Mullers Series.
