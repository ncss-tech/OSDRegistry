MYSOL SERIES

Mysol series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Mysol soils are on lake plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mysol soils are on lake plains and alluvial flats.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Idway, Kawich and Benin soils.  Idway soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Kawich soils are sandy, occur on stable dunes, and do not have durinodes.  Benin soils are fine-textured and do not have durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very slow or ponded runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mysol soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly shadscale, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28B.

REMARKS:  The revision of April 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, calcareous, mesic Haploduridic Torriorthents by recognizing the presence of a calcic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 18 cm (A1, A2 and part of the ABk  horizons).
Durinodes - The zone from 43 to 137 cm (Bqk1, 2Bqk2, and 2Bqk3 horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from 79 to 137 cm (2Bqk2 and 2Bqk3 horizons).
Major lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to sandy material at 79 cm (2Bqk2 and 2Bqk3 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bqk1 horizon and parts of the ABk and 2Bqk2 horizons).
