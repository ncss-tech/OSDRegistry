MESITA SERIES

The Mesita series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.
Mesita soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.
