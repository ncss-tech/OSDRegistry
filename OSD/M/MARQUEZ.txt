MARQUEZ SERIES

The Marquez series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  These very gently to gently sloping soils formed in acid, stratified loamy and clayey Coastal plain sediments, primarily of the Reklaw Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.

Robco soils:  are on concave positions slightly lower in the landscape, have sandy surface layers, and contain gray depletions due to wetness.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained;  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is high.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture or rangeland grazing.  Pastures are commonly hybrid bermudagrass or bahiagrass.  Native vegetation is savannah that consists of mostly post oak and blackjack oak with an understory of little bluestem, yellow indiangrass, and longleaf uniola.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Leon County, Texas l985.  The name is from a community near the type location.

REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with the Kirvin or Rosanky soils.  The series was separated from the Rosanky series based on lower base saturation, and from the Kirvin series because the series province is in the udic moisture regime.

Diagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section:  13 to 33 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 Horizon)
Ochric epipedon:  0 to 13 inches. (A and E horizons)
Albic horizon:  7 to 13 inches. (E horizon)
Argillic horizon:  13 to 42 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)
Abrupt textural change:  At the upper boundary of the Bt horizon.
Depth to Densic Contact:  At the upper boundary of the Cd horizon.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S82TX-289-025 from Leon County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Data S82TX-289-25 from the type location for the series.
