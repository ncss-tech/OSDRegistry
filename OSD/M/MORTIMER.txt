COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cardington, Ellsworth, Geeburg, Glynwood, Pert, Shinrock, and Wyatt series. Cardington soils have rock fragments of dominantly sandstone and shale. Ellsworth soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the lower part of the series control section. Geeburg soils do not have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section. Glynwood soils have less than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Pert soils have sola thinner than 66 cm (26 inches). Shinrock and Wyatt soils do not have rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mortimer soils are on moraines and till plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. They formed in fine-textured, calcareous till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 213 to 274 meters (700 to 900 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nappanee and St. Clair soils that form a drainage sequence with the Mortimer soils. The somewhat poorly drained Nappanee soils are on slight rises and low knolls. The well drained St. Clair soils are on higher or more sloping landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is high or very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the solum and low in the dense till. Permeability is slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the dense till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is under cultivation, primarily corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. A relatively small proportion is in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, principally ash, beech, elm, hickory, oak, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio, and possibly northeastern Indiana and southern Michigan; MLRA 111B. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hancock County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: Mortimer soils are currently being converted from Blount, Morley, Nappanee, and St. Clair soils during modernization projects in MLRA 111B.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 99 cm (Bt horizon).
Densic contact: at 124 cm (top of the Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 20 cm.

Supporting laboratory data is needed to confirm the presence and depth of densic materials in the Cd horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data (HK-47) from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for the typical pedon.

Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 130021 in MO 11.
