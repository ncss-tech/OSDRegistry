Mean annual precipitation--760 to 1780 mm
Mean annual air temperature--9 to 11 degrees C
Frost Free Period--150 to 250 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
McKenna, and Norma--mineral soils, occur on depressions and drainageways
Dupont--limnic soil material, reaction (pH in 0.01 M CaCl2) of greater than 4.5, occurs on similar positions
Seattle, Semiahmoo-- reaction (pH in 0.01 M CaCl2) of greater than 4.5, occur on similar positions
Alderwood and Everett--lack aquic conditions within 50 cm, occurs on upslope hills and ridges

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
*Drainage class--Very poorly
*Depth to apparent seasonal water table--at the surface to a depth of 30 cm at times from January to December
*Flooding--none
*Ponding--frequent ponding of long to very long duration at times from January to December

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
This series is of moderate extent in the Puget Sound Basin of western Washington.
