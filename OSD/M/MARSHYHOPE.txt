SERIES ESTABLISHED: Sussex County, Delaware, 2006. 

REMARKS: Marshyhope soils were previously mapped as members of the Woodstown series, which is moderately well drained.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches) 
Argillic horizon--the zone from 36 to 64 cm (14 to 25 inches) 
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 60 cm (24 inches) of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction from January to May 

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series Control Section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm (0 to 59 inches)
