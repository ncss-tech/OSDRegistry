MEDLEY SERIES

The Medley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on footslopes, alluvial fans and drainageways below hills.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils formed in alluvium from igneous hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Medley gravelly sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; 20 percent igneous gravels; neutral; clear smooth boundary (6 to 20 inches thick).

     A2--10 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; common fine roots; 20 percent igneous gravels; neutral; clear smooth boundary (8 to 24 inches thick).

     Bk1--24 to 58 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; 10 percent igneous gravels; many threads and films of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary (18 to 45 inches thick).

     Bk2--58 to 65 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; 15 percent igneous gravels; many threads and films of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jeff Davis County, Texas; 22 miles west of Fort Davis, Texas on State Highway 166; 200 feet south of State Highway 166, about 1.7 miles east of its junction with Farm Road 505.  Latitude: 30 degrees, 31 minutes, 59 seconds north; Longitude: 104 degrees, 14 minutes, 43 seconds west., NAD83; UTM coordinates 572400 m E, 3378097 m N, Zone 13.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Aridic ustic

Solum thickness:  60 to greater than 80 inches

Thickness of mollic epipedon:  20 to 40 inches

Depth to secondary calcium carbonate accumulation:  12 to 36 inches

Rock fragments:  mainly less than 3 inches in size and range from a few to about 30 percent by volume

Clay content:  ranges from 18 to 35 percent

Texture:  loam, sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or their gravelly counterparts

A horizon 
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  3 to 5, dry or moist
Chroma:  2 to 3, dry or moist
Reaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline

Bk horizon 
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  3 to 7, dry or moist
Chroma:  3 to 4, dry or moist
Calcium carbonate accumulation:  films, threads, and masses of calcium carbonate range from few to many
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 15 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Medley soils are on the footslopes, alluvial fans and drainageways below base of hills, and in a few places on low terraces of streams.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils developed in loamy alluvium derived from igneous materials.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 66 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 160 to 220 days and elevations range from 3,800 to 6,695 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Santo Tomas series and Boracho, Brewster, Espy and Rockhouse soils. Boracho and Espy soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths less than 20 inches and are in similar and lower positions.  Brewster soils are shallow over igneous bedrock and are in higher positions.  Rockhouse soils are in the sandy-skeletal family and are in similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, medium on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly grasses such as blue grama, sideoats grama, cane bluestem and black grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Texas. MLRA 42. The series is of moderate extent.
