MEADIN SERIES

The Meadin series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in loamy and sandy material over gravelly sand.  These upland soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Meadin sandy loam - on a 10 percent convex southeast-facing slope in rangeland.  When described the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

   A--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose; 10 percent by volume of fine and medium gravel; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)

   AC--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; single grain; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; 20 percent by volume of fine and medium gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

   2C1--15 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; 35 percent by volume of gravel up to 1 inch in diameter; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 40 inches thick)

   2C2--30 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grain; loose; 30 percent by volume of fine and medium gravel; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Keya Paha County, Nebraska; 5 1/2 miles east and 4 1/2 miles north of Mills, Nebraska; 250 feet north and 100 feet east of southwest corner, sec. 21, T. 35 N., R. 17 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section is moist in some part from October through April; intermittently moist from May through July; driest in July through September
Depth to carbonates: Below 80 inches
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 7 to 20 inches
Depth to gravelly or very gravelly coarse sand or sand: 8 to 20 inches
Particle-size control section: averages 15 to 35 percent gravel by volume

A horizon:
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Gravelly phases are recognized
Rock fragments: rounded, gravel, 2-75mm. in size, 3 to 25 percent by volume
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral.

AC horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, loamy sand, sand, gravelly loamy sand and gravelly sand
Rock fragments: rounded, gravel 2-75mm. in size, 10 to 35 percent by volume
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

2C horizons:
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: gravelly coarse sand, gravelly sand or very gravelly coarse sand; in some pedons this horizon is stratified with layers of finer materials
Rock fragments: rounded, 2-75mm in size, content averages 20 to 35 percent by volume, but some horizons may have as much as 55 percent gravel by volume
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Doger, Dorrance, Dunday, Heber and Pivot series.  Doger, Dunday and Heber soils do not contain gravel and Heber soils are typically calcareous throughout.  Dorrance soils have lime at 0 to 10 inches.  Pivot soils are moderately deep to coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Meadin soils are on uplands, low ridges, terrace breaks, alluvial fans and foot slopes.  The soils formed in loamy and sandy material over gravelly material.  The slope gradients range from 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 28 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brocksburg, Jansen, Oneill, Paka and Simeon soils.  Brocksburg and Jansen soils have a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section and are above the Meadin soils.  Oneill soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section and are below areas of Meadin soils.  Paka soils have an argillic horizon, thicker solum, are developed over siltstone, and are below areas of Meadin soils.  Simeon soils are sandy throughout and do not have a mollic epipedon and are above Meadin soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained.  Surface runoff is low to rapid, depending on the slope gradient.  Permeability is rapid in the solum and very rapid in the underlying gravelly sand.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Meadin soils are used mainly as range.  The soils are generally not suited to cultivation except where irrigated.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nebraska and South Dakota.  Meadin soils are of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Nance County, Nebraska, 1958.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (A and AC horizon.

Pedons with textures of sandy loam or finer below a depth of 10 inches would likely classify in the typic rather than entic subgroup.  Consideration should be given to reclassifying the soil to Typic Haplustolls.
