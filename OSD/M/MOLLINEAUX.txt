MOLLINEAUX SERIES

The Mollineaux series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy deposits on moraines, stream terraces, and lake terraces. Slope ranges from 12 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, active, mesic Lamellic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Mollineaux loamy sand, on a 35 percent slope in woodland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

Some pedons have an E/B horizon with similar colors and textures.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mollineaux soils are on moraines, stream terraces, and lake terraces.  Slope ranges from 12 to 35 percent.  The Mollineaux soils formed in sandy and loamy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Remus and Spinks soils. The well drained Remus and Spinks soils are on similar landscape positions. Remus and Spinks soils do not have spodic materials.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is very low to medium depending on the slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy part and moderately high in the loamy part. Permeability is rapid in the sandy part and moderate in the loamy part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are wooded. Some areas are used for pasture. Common trees in wooded areas are northern red oak, red maple and sugar maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (A, E horizons). 
Albic horizon: from a depth 15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) (E horizon).
Spodic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 38 cm (9 to 15 inches) (Bs1 horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 69 to 203 cm (27 to 80 inches) (Bt part of the B/E horizon and E and Bt horizons).
Glossic horizon: from a depth of 96 to 163 cm (38 to 64 inches) (B/E horizon).

This series was formerly included in the Fern series as a well drained phase. The Fern series has been reclassified as sandy over loamy, mixed, active mesic Arenic Oxyaquic Glossudalfs. Further investigation will be needed to determine the extent of the Mollineaux series in the other counties where the Fern series has been mapped.
