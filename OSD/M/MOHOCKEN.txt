MOHOCKEN SERIES

The Mohocken series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from porphyritic latite.  Mohocken soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bridgecreek, Coser, Deer Creek, Eoj, Goodington, Harkers, Lynnbow, Norcan, Rands, Starhope and Zumwalt series.  

Bridgecreek and Coser soils have a mollic epipedon that is thicker than 25 cm. Deer Creek, Eoj, Goodington, Harkers, Lynnbow, Norcan and Rands soils lack bedrock within 100 cm.  Starhope soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 4 to 7 degrees C. and the rock fragments within the Bt horizon decrease with depth.  Zumwalt soils have a Bk horizon and have less than l5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mohocken soils are on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from porphyritic latite.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 2,290 to 2,870 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cucamungo and Ravenswood soils. Cucamungo soils are loamy-skeletal and are shallow to soft rock.  Ravenswood soils are clayey-skeletal and are 76 to 100 cm deep to hard bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity; .

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon, Utah juniper, low sagebrush, green ephedra and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA29.
