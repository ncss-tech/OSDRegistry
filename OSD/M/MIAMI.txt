MIAMI SERIES

The Miami series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Miami soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Miami soils are on till plains. Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 25 percent, but range to 60 percent. Miami soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 366 meters (600 to 1200 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brookston, Conover, Crosby, Crosier, Cyclone, Kokomo, Treaty, and Williamstown soils. The Miami soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Williamstown soils on summits and shoulders; the somewhat poorly drained Conover, Crosier, and Crosby soils on lower lying summits; and the poorly drained Brookston, Cyclone, and Treaty soils and the very poorly drained Kokomo soils in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 91 cm (2.0 to 3.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface water runoff is medium on the gentle slopes and high on the steeper slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low or low in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. Much of the more sloping part is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Indiana, southern Michigan, central and northern Illinois, southeastern Wisconsin, and western Ohio; mainly in MLRAs 111A and 111D, and lesser extents in MLRAs 95B, 97, 98, 108A, 110, 114A, and 115C. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of large extent, more than 1,300,000 acres.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Montgomery County, Ohio, 1910.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 79 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons). 
Densic contact: at 91 cm (top of 2Cd horizon).

Moderately permeable substratum, gravelly substratum, and heavy substratum phases are recognized, and may become new series when the subset soil surveys with these phases are updated.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.
