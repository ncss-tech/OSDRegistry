MUNJOR SERIES

The Munjor series consists of very deep well drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains or low terraces in river valleys in the Rolling Plains and Breaks, MLRA 73. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 580 millimeters (23 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Munjor sandy loam in a native grass field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable; few fine and medium roots; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 38 centimeters (3 to 15 inches) thick)

  2C1--18 to 112 centimeters (7 to 44 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; thin stratified layers of finer-textured and coarser-textured materials are throughout the horizon; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (38 to 127 centimeters (15 to 50 inches) thick)

  2C2--112 to 152 centimeters (44 to 60 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Flatnose and Peralta series.  
Flatnose soils contain channers and cobbles.  
Peralta soils are somewhat poorly drained and saturation occurs at 60 to 90 centimeters (24 to 36 inches) in March to October 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Parent material: alluvium
Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 13 degrees C. (47 to 55 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 410 to 750 millimeters (16 to 30 inches)
Thornthwaite annual P-E index: 30 to 40
Frost-free period: 160 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gibbon, Inavale, McCook, and Roxbury soils.  
Gibbon soils are on slightly lower landform positions and are poorly drained.  
Inavale soils are on similar landform positions and have a sandy particle size control section.
McCook soils are on similar landform positions and have less than 15 percent sand in the particle size control sections.  
Roxbury soils are on slightly higher positions and contain greater than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well or moderately well
Runoff: very low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high
Water table: below 1.8 meters (6 feet) except during short periods of high stream flow

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Munjor soils are cultivated.  
Grain sorghums, winter wheat, and alfalfa are the main crops.  
Native vegetation is mixed grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Kansas, adjacent areas of Nebraska, and south- central South Dakota.  LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 73, Rolling Plains and Breaks, MLRA 74 Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 75 Central Loess Plains; LRR G Western Great Plains Range and Irrigated Region, MLRA 63A Northern Rolling Pierre Shale Plains, MLRA 64 Mixed Sandy and Silty Tableland, MLRA 65 Nebraska Sand Hills MLRA 63B Southern Rolling Pierre Shale Plains, MLRA 66 Dakota-Nebraska Eroded Tableland.

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A horizon) 

Some pedons may have an AC horizon.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy: Eleventh edition, 2010

Modified format by LRM in 8/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

07/2011 GLP Corrected USGS quadrangle name and added latitude and longitude.  2C1 & 2C2 added the vertical subdivision designation. Added soil moisture, soil temperature regime, mean annual soil temperature, and clay and sand particle size content to RIC. Added clay content, sand content,calcium carbonate equivalance, and reaction to horizon data in RIC. Updated competing series. Lowered mean annual air temperature from 14 to 13 degrees C based on climate data and added frost free days.  Updated geographically associated soils. Added flooding frequency. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters. Changed runoff to very low.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data for typical pedon is from the Ellis County, Kansas Soil Survey, Issued August 1975. Additional laboratory data-- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedons: 53KS141008 and 53KS141004.
