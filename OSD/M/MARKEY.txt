MARKEY SERIES

The Markey series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils.  They formed in herbaceous organic material 40 to 130 centimeters thick overlying sandy deposits in depressions on outwash plains, lake plains, flood plains, river terraces, valley trains, and moraines. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic layers and rapid or very rapid in the sandy material.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, euic, frigid Terric Haplosaprists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Markey muck - on a slope of 1 percent in a bog with marsh vegetation.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oa1--0 to 23 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2), black (10YR 2/1) rubbed muck (sapric material); about 10 percent fibers, less than 5 percent rubbed; weak thin platy structure; fibers are primarily herbaceous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5 in water); clear smooth boundary.

    Oa2--23 to 30 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), very dark brown (10YR 2/2) rubbed muck (sapric material) about 20 percent fiber, less than 5 percent rubbed; weak thin platy structure; fibers are primarily herbaceous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5 in water); clear smooth boundary.

    Oa3--30 to 61 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) on broken face and rubbed muck (sapric material); about 10 percent fiber, less than 5 percent rubbed; moderate thick platy structure; fibers are primarily herbaceous; about 20 percent mineral soil material; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5 in water); gradual wavy boundary.

    Oa4--61 to 81 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2), black (10YR 2/1) rubbed muck (sapric material); about 5 percent fiber, less than 5 percent rubbed; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; primarily herbaceous fibers; less than 10 percent mineral soil material; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5 in water); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of Oa horizons is 40 to 130 centimeters.)

    Cg--81 to 152 centimeters; gray (N 5/0) sand; single grain; loose; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area 94A  Northern Michigan and Wisconsin Sandy Drift, Clare County Michigan Subset; about 2 miles north of Clare; 660 feet east and 891 feet north of the southwest corner, sec. 13, T. 17 N., R. 4 W. USGS Loomis Quadrangle; 43 degrees 51 minutes 39 seconds north latitude, 89 degrees 44 minutes 44 seconds west longitude; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the sandy C horizon is commonly 61 to 107 centimeters and ranges from 40 to 130 centimeters.  The organic material is primarily derived from herbaceous plants.  There are no free carbonates in the organic material.  Some pedons contain as much as 15 percent by volume of fragments of twigs, branches, or logs that range from about 0.3 to 15 centimeters in diameter.

Oi horizon (when present on the surface):
Thickness  2 to 10 centimeters
Organic material  sphagnum moss

Oa horizons:
Hue  2.5YR to 10YR, or neutral
Value - 2 to 4 
Chroma - 0 to 3
Reaction - pH 4.5 to 7.8 in 0.01M calcium chloride 
--Broken face, rubbed, and pressed soil material may vary by one unit in color value or chroma or both.

The organic layer immediately above C horizons commonly contains more mineral soil material than overlying organic layers.

A horizon (when present):
Hue  10YR to 2.5Y, or neutral
Value  2 or 3
Chroma  0 or 1
Texture  fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand
Reaction  pH 5.6 to 7.3
Thickness  0 to 10 centimeters

C horizon:
Hue - 7.5YR to 5Y, or neutral 
Value - 4 to 6
Chroma - 0 to 4
Texture - sand, fine sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, and the gravelly analogs of loamy sand, sand, and coarse sand 
Gravel content - 0 to 35 percent by volume    
Reaction - very strongly acid to moderately alkaline
--Thin layers of loamy materials overlying the sand are included.  
--Some pedons in floodplains have thin layers of organic materials.

Surface tier (0 to 30 centimeters):
Organic material - mainly sapric material, but some pedons have either sapric or hemic material or both in varying proportions.  
Structure - weak platy or granular, but in some pedons is massive. 

Subsurface tier (30 to 90 centimeters):
Organic material  dominantly sapric material, but some pedons have as much as 25 centimeters of hemic material or 13 centimeters of fibric material.
Structure, organic material - weak, thick to thin platy, weak coarse granular, or blocky subangular blocky
Structure, mineral material - structureless (massive or single grain)

Bottom tier (90 to 130 centimeters):
Structure, organic material - weak, thick to thin platy, weak coarse granular, or blocky subangular blocky
Structure, mineral material - structureless (massive or single grain)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Pondicherry and Tawas series.  Pondicherry soils have higher mean annual precipitation. Tawas soils are formed primarily from woody plant materials.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Markey soils are in depressions within outwash plains, lake plains, flood plains, river terraces, valley trains, and moraines.  Soils on nearby uplands are predominantly sandy.
Slope - 0 to 2 percent 
Mean annual precipitation - 380 to 1120 millimeters.  
Mean annual air temperature - 2 to 8 degrees C. 
Frost free period - 70 to 145 days
Elevation - 180 to 855 meters above sea level

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carbondale, Greenwood, and Rifle soils; and the Deford, Kinross, and Roscommon soils.
Carbondale - formed in herbaceous organic material greater than 130 centimeters thick and are in the Hemic Haplosaprists Subgroup.
Greenwood - formed in mostly hemic soil material greater than 130 centimeters thick, are in the dysic reaction class, and in the Typic Haplohemists Subgroup. 
Rifle soils formed in mostly hemic soil material greater than 130 centimeters thick and are in the Typic Haplohemists Subgroup.
Deford, Kinross, and Roscommon - are poorly drained sandy soils near the edge of the bogs.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class - Depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 30 centimeters above the surface to 15 centimeters below the surface during November to June in most years (very poorly drained).  
Flooding frequency - occasional and frequent 
Surface runoff potential  negligible
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material and rapid or very rapid in the sandy material

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is in native vegetation.  Most areas are forested with black ash, quaking aspen, balsam fir, black spruce, tamarack, northern white-cedar, and paper birch.  Some areas are in cattails, marsh grasses, reeds, and sedges.  A small part is used for permanent pasture.
