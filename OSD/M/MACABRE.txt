MACABRE SERIES

The Macabre series consists of soils that are moderately deep to decomposing welded tuff and deep to hard fractured welded tuff bedrock. They are well drained and are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Macabre very cobbly ashy sandy clay loam , in non-stocked forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 9 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) very cobbly ashy sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and  slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; 15 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt--9 to 17 inches;  grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very cobbly ashy sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots and few coarse roots; many medium tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 14  inches thick)

    BC--17 to 27 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) very cobbly ashy sandy clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, few medium and coarse roots; common medium tubular pores; 20 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual irregular boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Cr--27 to 41 inches; light gray (N 7/) decomposing welded tuff bedrock. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    R--41 inches; light gray (5Y 7/1) fractured hard welded tuff bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Macabre soils are mainly used for woodland, rangeland, watershed, and as wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, Rocky Mountain juniper, Oregongrape, common snowberry, bitterbrush, quaking aspen, sandberg bluegrass, tufted hairgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, lupine and rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Macabre soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Jefferson County, Montana, 1998; proposed in Deer Lodge County, Montana, 1996.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1730, MT3232, MT3233.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the surface to 9 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 9 to 17 inches (Bt horizon); a particle size control section from 9 to 17 inches (Bt horizon); a layer of decomposing welded tuff from 27 to 41 inches (Cr horizon); welded tuff bedrock at 41 inches (R horizon).  Macabre soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
