MINDEN SERIES

The Minden series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves and loess covered stream terraces on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Bremer--are at lower elevations on flood plains and have a clay content that averages 35 to 40 percent in the particle-size control section
Corley--are at lower elevations in depressions on interfluves and stream terraces and have an eluvial horizon
Marshall--are at higher elevations on interfluves and stream terraces and have a matrix chroma of 3 or more in the upper part of the cambic horizon
Nevin--are in landform positions similar to those of the Minden soils and have an argillic horizon

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs between depths of 0.3 to 1.0 meter during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second

Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and alfalfa. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, indiangrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Dissected till plains
MLRAs--Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills (107) and Iowa and Missouri Heavy Till Plain (109)

udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
