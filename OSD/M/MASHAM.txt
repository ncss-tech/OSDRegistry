MASHAM SERIES

The Masham series consists of shallow, well drained soils on crests and side slopes of hillslopes on low hills, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). These very slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from red shales of Permian age. Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 860 mm (34 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, active, thermic, shallow Udic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Masham silty clay loam, on a 10 percent slightly convex slope, in native rangeland, at an elevation of 305 m (1000 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; strong very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; many fine roots; slightly effervescent, moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 23 cm [3 to 9 in])

  Bk--13 to 41 cm (5 to 16 in); reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) silty clay, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; many pressure faces; few round calcium carbonate concretions from 10 to 50 mm in diameter; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary. (Thickness of the Bk horizon is 13 to 43 cm [5 to 17 in])

  Cd--41 to 102 cm (16 to 40 in); reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) weathered silty shale, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; extremely hard, firm; noncemented; few fine roots in fractures; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Payne County, Oklahoma; about 6 miles north and 4 miles east of Stillwater; about 500 feet west and 150 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 21, T. 20 N., R. 3 E.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Highview series in the same family. 
Highview soils: formed in colluvial material weathered from gray Permian shales, and usually contain more coarse fragments throughout the soil

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: material that weathered from red shale of Permian age
Landscape: uplands
Landform: on crests and side slopes of hillslopes on low hills 
Slope: 1 to 45 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 660 to 1020 mm (26 to 40 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 18 degrees C (58 to 64 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 200 to 230 days
Elevation: 213 to 457 m (700 to 1500 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Highview series, and the Grainola, and Renfrow series. 
Grainola and Renfrow soils: are more than 51 cm (20 in) to bedrock and occur on slopes above the Masham soils 
Highview soils: occur on similar landform positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well drained
Permeability: very slow
Runoff: very high

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for grazing livestock.  Native vegetation is mainly sideoats grama, blue grama, hairy grama, buffalo grass, prickly pear, tall dropseed, switchgrass, and little bluestem.  Where overgrazed, bare areas occur.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central and south central Oklahoma; LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). The series is moderately extensive
