MACK SERIES

The Mack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Mack soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, stream terraces and mesas. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Mack loam in cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

	Ap--0 to 15 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

	Btk1--15 to 36 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots throughout and between peds; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and few faint clay films on surfaces along pores; few fine and medium irregular calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

	Btk2--36 to 51 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots throughout and between peds; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common fine irregular calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

	Btk3--51 to 127 cm; pink (7.5YR 8/4) gravelly clay loam, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common fine and medium irregular calcium carbonate masses in the matrix and few distinct carbonate coats on rock fragments; 15 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of Btk horizons is 90 to 150 cm) 

	Bk--127 to 203 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) gravelly clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine tubular pores; few fine and medium irregular calcium carbonate masses in the matrix and few distinct carbonate coats on rock fragments; 20 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
