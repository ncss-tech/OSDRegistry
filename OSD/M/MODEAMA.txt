MODEAMA SERIES

The Modeama series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in colluvium from limestone.  These soils are on mountains.  Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Modeama extremely cobbly silt loam - Woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

TYPE LOCATION: Otero County, New Mexico; approximately 2.5 miles south and 1.25 miles west of Timberon; 200 feet west and 200 feet south of the northeast corner of Section 4, Range 12 E., Township 20 S.  USGS El Paso Canyon topographic quadrangle; latitude: 32 degrees 36 minutes  6.35 seconds north. and longitude: 105 degrees 42 minutes 47.89 seconds west UTM Zone: 13, 433067E, 3607174N; NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture:  A typic ustic moisture regime. The moisture control section is usually dry in some or in all parts for six-tenths or less of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  Some part of the epipedon is moist for more than 90 cumulative days in most years when the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.

Mean annual soil temperature:  51 to 55 degrees F.
Thickness of mollic epipedon:  10 to 20 inches
Depth to lithic contact:  20 to 40 inches
Depth to calcic horizon:  10 to 20 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 40 to 50 percent
Coarse fragment content:  65 to 85 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle size control section average 5 to 15 percent:  

A horizon:
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist
Coarse fragments:  limestone fragments; 65 to 85 percent total coarse fragments; 10 to 25 percent gravel; 45 to 55 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones.
 
Bt horizon:
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist
Calcium Carbonates equivalent: 5 to 15 percent
Coarse fragments:  limestone fragments; 65 to 85 percent total coarse fragments; 15 to 30 percent gravel; 40 to 50 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones.

Bk horizon:
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Coarse fragments:  calcrete and limestone fragments; 65 to 85 percent total coarse fragments; 15 to 25 percent gravel; 30 to 40 percent cobbles, 0 to 15 percent stones, 15 to 25 percent calcrete fragments.
Calcium carbonates equivalent: 40 to 60 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: colluvium from limestone
Landform: mountains
Slope: 5 to 35 percent
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 54 degrees
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 18 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days
Elevation: 6,500 to 7,650 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cale, Penalto (T), and Penapon series. 
Cale soils: very deep and are in mountian valleys.
Penalto  soils: shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and are on hills.
Penapon soils: very deep and are on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Runoff is high on slopes of 5 to 20 percent and very high on slopes greater than 20 percent.
