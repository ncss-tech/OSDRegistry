MONWEBB SERIES

The Monwebb series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in saline, clayey alluvium derived from the tertiary aged sediments. These nearly level to very gently sloping, occasionally flooded soils are on floodplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).

The grasses consist primarily of buffalograss, sideoats grama, curlymesquite, hairy tridens, Southwestern bristlegrass, and threeawn. Woody vegetation is mostly acacia, condalia, prickly pear, mesquite, Texas persimmon, and huisache. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I, MLRA 83B; moderate extent.

soils are not flooded.
