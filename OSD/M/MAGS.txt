MAGS SERIES

The Mags series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.  Mags soils are on structural benches and summits of mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Montrose County, Colorado, Ridgway soil survey area.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 5 to 25 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 5 inches.  (A, BE horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 5 to 39 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, Btk2 horizons)
Secondary carbonates:  The zone from 24 to 60 inches.  (Btk and BCk horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
