Bottlespring soils are well drained, have greater than 35 percent clay throughout the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a duripan.  
Shukash soils are somewhat excessively drained, have andic soil properties in the upper portion of the particle-size control section and 10 to 20 percent clay in the lower portion of the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage - poorly drained
Permeability - very slow
Watertable - a seasonal water table is at its uppermost limit in January through May
