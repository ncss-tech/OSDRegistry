SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Monroe County, Florida, 1989.

REMARKS:
These soils were formerly classified as Lithic Udifolists and are revised here to the twelfth edition of the keys (2014).
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this Pedon:

1.	Lithic (micro) contact - 15 centimeters (6 inches) (2R horizon)
2.	Peraquic feature - the zone from 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches).
3.	Aquic conditions - endosaturation ranges from 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches).
4.	Sulfidic feature - the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) contains sulfidic soil materials.

These soils maybe be mapped in out of place landform positions and need to be investigated in future updates (formerly recognized as a moderately well drained soil).
