MINESHAFT SERIES

The Mineshaft series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from igneous rocks.  Mineshaft soils are on shoulders and backslopes of ridges and hillslopes in mountains.  Slopes range from 6 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mineshaft gravelly loam, on a northwest facing, slightly convex ridge of 7 percent, forested, at an elevation of about 1,680 meters.

     R--67 to 200 cm; fractured igneous bedrock; fractures less than 1 cm wide occur irregularly spaced at 50 to 100 cm intervals at the upper contact.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this taxonomic family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Precipitation pattern:  In most years, half or more of the normal precipitation falls as rain and/or snow from March through mid-July.
Frost-free period:  60 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Buska, Goldmine, Grizzly, Pactola, and Virkula soils are deep or very deep.  The Buska, Goldmine, Grizzly and Pactola soils occur on similar landscapes positions as Mineshaft soils.  In addition, Buska and Pactola formed in schist and Goldmine soils have a cryic soil temperature regime.  Virkula soils are are fine-silty and they generally occur on less-sloping footslope positions than Mineshaft soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mineshaft soils are normally wooded and utilized for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and timber production.  The native vegetation consists of an overstory of ponderosa pine, Black Hills spruce, and quaking aspen; understory species include bearberry, Oregon grape, common juniper, bluegrass, wheatgrass, and fescue. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Crystalline-Igneous physiographic area of the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming; LRR G, MLRA 62; the series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Update of the Soil Survey of Lawrence County, South Dakota, 2006.  The name is derived from the abundance of abandoned vertical and horizontal surface mine shafts within the series domain.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 48 to 67 cm (Bt/E horizon)
Argillic horizo: The zone from 48 to 67 cm (Portions of the Bt/E horizon)
Mollic intergrade:  The surface 18 cm of mineral soil, when mixed, meets the criteria for a mollic epipedon (A horizon and upper part of the E horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with hard fractured igneous bedrock at 67 cm (R horizons)
Other features:  The E horizon typically has chroma (moist, or dry, or both) that is too high, and value too low, to qualify as an albic horizon.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
