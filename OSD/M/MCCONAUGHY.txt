MCCONAUGHY SERIES

The McConaughy series consists of deep well drained soils on upland hillslopes.  They formed in calcareous loess.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  McConaughy loam with a slope of 12 percent, on a lower back slope, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless other wise stated.)

  A1--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

  A2--15 to 33 centimeters (6 to 13 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness A horizon is 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches)

  Bw1--33 to 43 centimeters (13 to 17 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  Bw2--43 to 56 centimeters (17 to 22 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches.)

  BC--56 to 86 centimeters (22 to 34 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; few small soft white accumulations of carbonates; violent effervescence; strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 36 centimeters (6 to 14 inches) thick.)

  C1--86 to 102 centimeters (34 to 40 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few small soft white accumulations of carbonates; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary.

  C2--102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few small soft white accumulations of carbonates; strong effervescence; strongly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Keith County, Nebraska; about 11 kilometers (7 miles) west and 13 kilometers (8 miles) north of Brule; 145 meters (475 feet) east and 384 meters (1260 feet) south of the northwest corner of section 4, T. 14 N., R. 41 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 12 degrees C. (51 to 53 degrees F.)

Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 25 to 46 centimeters (10 to 18 inches)
Depth to cambic horizon: 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches)
Clay content: 10 to 18 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 4 or 5 (2 or 3 moist) 
Chroma: 2 or 3 
Texture: loam or very fine sandy loam 
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline 

Bw horizon:
Hue: 10YR 
Value: 5 to 7, (4 or 5 moist) 
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam or very fine sandy loam 
Clay content: 10 to 18 percent

BC and C horizon:
Hue: 10YR 
Value:  5 to 7, (4 or 5 moist) 
Chroma: 2 to 4 
Texture: loam or very fine sandy loam 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent
Reaction:  moderately or strongly alkaline 
Some pedons have a Bk horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Oglala and Tripp series.
Oglala soils have soft fine grained sandstone at depths of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches).
Tripp soils have carbonates at depths of 46 to 102 centimeters (18 to 40 inches) and are on stream terraces.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: derived from loamy calcareous loess
Landform: on gently sloping to moderately steep upland back slopes and the upper part of foot slopes 
Slopes: 3 to 15 percent
Elevation: 914 to 1219 meters (3000 to 4000 feet)
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 11 degrees C. (49 to 51 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 43 to 48 centimeters (17 to 19 inches)
Frost-free period: 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Duroc, keith and Sulco series.
Duroc soils have a mollic epipedon more than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick and are on toe slopes or swales positions on the landscape.
Keith soils have an argillic horizon and are on summits.
Sulco soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are on upper side slopes and on shoulders.
 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:      moderately high
Runoff: medium 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of McConaughy soils are in rangeland.  Some small areas are in cropland.  The native grasses are mainly little bluestem, blue grama, western wheatgrass, big bluestem, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nebraska and possibly Kansas and northeastern Colorado.  The series is extensive.
