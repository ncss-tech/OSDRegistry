MIKIM SERIES

The Mikim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Mikim soils are on alluvial fans, drainageways, and valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Mikim loam, on a west facing, 4 percent slope, in irrigated cropland at an elevation of 6,000 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.

    AC--3 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.

    C1--9 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. 

    C2--15 to 19 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. 

    C3--19 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) stratified fine sandy loam and clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

    C4--32 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine irregular carbonate threads; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Montezuma County, Colorado; located about 2,100 feet west and 2,100 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 31, T. 35 N., R. 16 W.; Towaoc, Colorado USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 14 minutes 43 seconds N. and long. 108 degrees 39 minutes 10.2 seconds W., WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime: Aridic, bordering on ustic
Soil temperature regime: mesic
Mean annual soil temperature: 45 to 53 degrees F

Particle-size control section: 18 to 35 percent clay

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR to 5Y
Value:  4 to 7 (3 to 6 moist)
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  loam or clay loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent mainly as sandstone gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent
Reaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline

C horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR to 5Y
Value:  5 to 7 (3 to 6 moist)
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or fine sandy loam
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent mainly as sandstone gravel
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 3 to 10 percent
Gypsum content: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction:  slightly to strongly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the El Rancho, Kishona, Neville, Paradox, Pojoaque, Shavano, Thedalund, Theedle, and Tsosie series.  El Rancho soils contain more than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Kishona soils soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section for less than 90 cumulative days when the soil at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more and are not moist for 45 consecutive days following July 15.  Neville, Paradox, and Pojoaque soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the control section.  Shavano, Thedalund, and Theedle soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tsosie soils are highly stratified in the lower part of the C horizon with sandy loam and silt loams.  Also, Tsosie soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section from April 15 to July 1. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: alluvium derived from sandstone and shale
Landform:  alluvial fans, drainageways, and valleys
Slopes:  0 to 15 percent
Elevation: 5,400 to 6,200 feet
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 13 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period: 120 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mikett, Zyme, and Barx soils.  Mikett soils have a water table within 60 inches of the surface during some time during the year.  Zyme soils have soft shale within 20 inches of the surface.  Barx soils are derived from eolian material and have a calcic horizon within 40 inches of the surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, negligible to medium runoff, moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for range; however, they are used as dryland or irrigated cropland in some locations.  Rangeland vegetation consists of Indian ricegrass, galleta, western wheatgrass, and big sagebrush

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: La Plata County, Colorado. 1982. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 9 inches.  (A and AC)

The type location was moved to Montezuma County from La Plata County as a result of the 1992 Four Corners Moisture and Temperature Meeting.  The former La Plata County type location was in an Ustic moisture regime bordering on Aridic, with a precipitation of 15 inches.

This series, although having some soil structure described in underlying horizons, does not exhibit other additional supporting evidence of a cambic horizon, namely a soil color change or the removal or translocation of calcium carbonate or gypsum.
