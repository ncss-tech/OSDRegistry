MAGHILLS SERIES

The Maghills series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Maghills soils are on alluvial fans and fan skirts. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Typic Torriorthents

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at the present time.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maghills soils are on alluvial fans and fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from weathered limestone with a component of volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alley, Nuc, and Umil soils. Alley soils have an argillic horizon Nuc soils have cemented layers within 100 cm of the surface and have a calcic horizon Umil soils are shallow to an indurated duripan

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly winterfat, shadscale, low rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, and bud sagebrush

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada these soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
