MOONCREEK SERIES

The Mooncreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountain slopes with slopes of 9 to 75 percent in linear slope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from slightly metamorphosed sandstone and mudstone. The elevation ranges from 18 to 1437 meters (59 to 4715 feet).  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2030 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F). The mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The frost free period is about 150 to 250 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Noisy and Tossup series. The Tossup series is fine with greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Noisy soils are loamy-skeletal with greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Tossup soils are generally on linear and concave slope positions.  The Noisy soils are generally on convex slope positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone, Cascade barberry, bracken fern and modesty.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The name is taken from Moon Creek. The series is of moderate extent.
