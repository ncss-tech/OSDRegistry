MONTCALM SERIES

The Montcalm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy drift on moraines, outwash plains, and glacial drainage channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar series with a superactive cation-exchange activity class include the Akeley, Andrusia, Braham, DeMontreville, Leaflake, and Redeye series. None of these soils have lamellae within the series control section. Akeley soils have loamy lacustrine materials in the lower part of the series control section. Andrusia soils have carbonates within 150 cm of the mineral soil surface. Braham, DeMontreville, Leaflake, and Redeye soils have loamy till materials in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Montcalm soils formed in sandy and loamy drift on moraines, outwash plains, and glacial drainage channels. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 18 percent but range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 700 to 920 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees C. Frost-free period is 90 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Graycalm, Hodenpyl, Isabella, Kalkaska, Mancelona, McBride, Menominee, and Rubicon soils. The somewhat excessively drained Graycalm and Kalkaska, and the excessively drained Rubicon soils are on similar and landform positions and slight rises and do not have argillic horizons. The well drained Hodenpyl and well drained and moderately well drained Isabella soils are on similar landform positions and have loamy materials within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface. The somewhat excessively drained Mancelona soils are on similar landform positions and have average rock fragment contents greater than 35 percent in the lower part of the series control section. The well drained and moderately well drained McBride soils are in slight depressions and have a fragipan. The well drained Menominee soils are in slight depressions and have a lithologic discontinuity within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is very low to medium depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are forested. Some areas are idle cropland or in pasture. A small portion of these soils are cultivated with small grains and hay the principle crops. Native vegetation is intermixed hardwoods and conifers, predominantly northern red oak, red pine, sugar maple, jack pine, bigtooth aspen, and eastern white pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. These soils are extensive with about 243,000 acres of the series mapped.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap and E horizons).
Albic horizon: the zones from a depth of 18 to 23 cm (E horizon) and from a depth of 38 to 66 cm (E' horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 66 to 152 cm (Bt horizon and Bt part of the E and Bt horizon).
Lamellae: from a depth of 84 to 152 cm (Bt part of the E and Bt horizon).

A stony surface phase and a gravelly surface phase are currently recognized in MLRA 94A. Future evaluation is needed to place these soils into a more appropriate series concept.
