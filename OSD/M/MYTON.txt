MYTON SERIES

The Myton series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Myton soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees
F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Myton extremely bouldery loam-rangeland (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated)

	C1--0 to 4 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) extremely bouldery loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm; few fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 20 percent boulders, 30 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles, and 15 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

	C2--4 to 90 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) very cobbly sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm; few fine tubular pore; 2 percent boulders, 10 percent stones, and 40 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0)

TYPE LOCATION: San Juan County, Utah; Copper Point USGS quadrangle; Blue Notch Canyon; about 1700 feet west and 1000 feet south of the southwest corner of section 32, T. 34 S., R. 15 E. in an area lacking a Public Land Survey; lat. about 37 degrees 46 minutes 8 seconds North and long. About 110 degrees 18 minutes 30 seconds West. NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: the soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section more than 75 percent of the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July through September and December through February.  Typic aridic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 54 to 59 degrees F.

Depth to sandstone bedrock: 40 to more than 60 inches

Rock fragments: averages 35 to 60 percent

Clay content: 10 to 18 percent

A horizon (when present)
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry' 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 4 to 8, dry or moist
Texture:  sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand
Rock fragments: 20 to 85 percent, but averages 35 to 60 percent in the particle size control section.  All size classes of rock fragments may be represented; but the particle size control section is dominated by cobbles.
Effervescence: slightly or strongly effervescent
Reaction: moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cliffdown (NV), Clifterson (WY), Clowfin (NV), Defler (NV), Dient (UT), and Trocken (NV) series.  All of the series listed have hue of 7.5YR or yellower. Clifterson and Dient soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Myton soils are on steep and very steep hillsides and formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 30 to 70 percent. Elevation is 3,150 to 6,400 feet.  Mean annual air temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches.  Frost free period is 150 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nakai, Redhouse, Shalet, and Skos soils.  The Nakai and Redhouse soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  The Shalet and Skos soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high runoff, moderately rapid
permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing  Vegetation is blackbrush, shadscale, saline wildrye, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Utah.  The series is of moderate
extent. MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richfield Area, Sevier County, Utah, 1947.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 4 inches (C1
horizon)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the C2 horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

Type Location moved from Sevier County, Utah to San Juan County, Utah in January, 2003.

In Utah the Myton series is correlated to Desert Ecological Sites.
