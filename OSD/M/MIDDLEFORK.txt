MIDDLEFORK SERIES

The Middlefork series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent in mountain valleys and intermontane basins. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Argixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Middlefork loam, forested -- on an 11 percent convex east-facing slope at 3,350 feet elevation. When described on October 20, 1997, the soil was moist to 4 inches and dry below. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Bt2--32 to 47 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) continuous lamellae 4 to 10 mm thick and 2 to 4 inches apart; 5 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick) 

   Bt3--47 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) discontinuous lamellae 4 to 10 mm thick and 6 to 12 inches apart with variable orientation; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carmack, Elkcreek, Johnson, Mojo, Molyneux, Moolmool (T), Muldoon, Simonton, Skelter and Suloaf series. Carmack soils have 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section and do not have lamellae. Elkcreek and Mojo soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and in addition, Mojo soils do not have an activity class family designated. Johnson soils do not have lamellae, are sometimes less than 40 inches deep to bedrock and are formed in loess and residuum (see remarks). Moolmool soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Muldoon soils have a duripan (Bqm horizon) and do not have an O horizon. Molyneux soils do not have an O horizon and have argillic horizons that are slightly acid or neutral. Simonton soils do not have an O horizon and do not have lamellae. Skelter soils do not have an O horizon, have extremely acid to strongly acid stratified discontinuous lithology below the argillic horizon and are dry 90 to 120. Suloaf soils have 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Middlefork soils are strongly sloping to steep on dissected fan remnants and outwash terrace remnants at elevations of 3,050 to 5,250 feet. These soils formed in lacustrine sediments derived from igneous rocks and fine pyroclastic materials. Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Charters, Hellake, Pinney and Zeb soils. Charters soils do not have argillic horizons and occur on more exposed geomorphic positions. Hellake soils are mesic and occur on south-facing slopes. Pinney soils have pachic epipedons and occur on steeper north-facing slopes. Zeb soils are skeletal and occur on convex summits and shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Middlefork soils are used mainly for timber production and woodland grazing. Some areas are used for homesites. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, common snowberry, mallow ninebark and Geyers (elk) sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43b and 44. Middlefork soils are of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Mollic epipedon - zone from 1 to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon - zone from 15 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - zone from 15 to 35 inches
Soil moisture regime - xeric

All depths related to diagnostic horizons and features listed in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.

Further investigations are needed to confirm the typical depth class and soil temperature regime of the Johnson series. Presence or absence of discontinuous lamellae may not be adequate criteria for series separation. However, soil genesis of the two series is a key difference: residual material vs. lacustrine deposits.
