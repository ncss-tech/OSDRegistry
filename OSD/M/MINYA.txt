COMPETING SERIES: There are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over colluvium and/or gravelly till
Elevation: 2,546 to 5,295 feet (776 to 1,614 m)
Slope: 2 to 65 percent
Annual precipitation: 25 to 52 inches (623 to 1,310 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Castnot, Field, Frostcircle, and Ogive soils. Castnot soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on mountains. Field soils are well drained, moderately deep, and occur on mountains. Frostcircle soils are poorly drained very shallow to shallow to permafrost, and occur on mountains. Ogive soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high above the bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is white mountain avens-mixed ericaceous shrub dwarf alpine scrub, shrub birch bog blueberry scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
