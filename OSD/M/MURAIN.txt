MURAIN SERIES

The Murain series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Murain soils are on moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

Bullump soils have lithic contacts between 40 and 80 inches from the soil surface.  Bullvaro, Demner, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Camelback soils have lithic contacts between 40 and 80 inches from the soil surface.  Chrisflat soils are dominated by gravel and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Dogbed soils are dominated by gravel and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Krenka soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Snyderville soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of less than 36 inches.  Softback soils average 25 to 32 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mollic epipedons that do not include the upper Bt horizons.  Softscrabble soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and typically have paralithic contacts between 60 and 80 inches from the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Murain soils are on moraines.  They formed in till derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granodiorite, andesite, schist, and gneiss.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches, mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aspetill and Cloudburst soils.  Aspetill soils have a cryic soil temperature regime.  Cloudburst soils have umbric epipedons that are less than 20 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderate permeability (moderately high or high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Murain soils are used for rangeland, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and western needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, on the east side of the Sierra Nevada Range.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 22A.
