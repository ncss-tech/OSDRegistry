MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dodge County, Minnesota, 2005.

REMARKS: Mantorville soils replace Thurston and Wykoff soils in southeast Minnesota that are on upland old terrace systems which are considered to be older than the Wisconsin system. Lamellae have been observed to depths of about twelve feet. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Mollic epipedon--the zone from the 0 surface to a depth of 15 inches;
Argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 15 to 30 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
Udic moisture regime.

Lamellic feature - the zone from a depth of 48 to 80 inches (Bt part of the E&Bt horizon); total thickness of lamellae is less than 3 inches within a depth of 80 inches. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
