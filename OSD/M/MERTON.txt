MERTON SERIES

The Merton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 35 to 60 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till.  These soils are on linear and slightly convex slopes on ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Merton silt loam, on a linear slope of 2 percent, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 378 meters above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Bw1--41 to 58 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few tongues of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2); common tubular pores; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (8 to 25 centimeters thick) 

 2Bw2--58 to 71 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loam high in content of silt; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common tubular pores; about 5 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A, Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, 2Bw4, and 2BC horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A, Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, 2Bw4, 2BC, and 2C horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 41 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 41 to 91 centimeters (Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, and 2Bw4 horizons); 
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
