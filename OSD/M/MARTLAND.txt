MARTLAND SERIES

The Martland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granodiorite, gneiss, and/or schist.  Martland soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 331 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Martland sandy loam, on a southeast facing, 4 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 2774 meters (9100 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on October 9, 1991.

       A--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

       Bw1--8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. 

       Bw2--15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.

       Bw3--25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 28 to 71 cm)

       Cr--61 to 86 cm (24 to 34 inches); moderately cemented granodiorite, with bands of gneiss and quartz.

TYPE LOCATION:  Park County, Colorado; about 21 kilometers (13 miles) northeast  of Hartsel; located about 600 feet north and 500 feet west of the southeast corner of Sec. 29, T. 11 S., R. 73 W.;   Glentivar USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 3 minutes 14 seconds N. and long. 105 degrees 34 minutes 7 seconds W., NAD 1983.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is usually dry in late spring and early summer, moist in some part in late July and August, and intermittently dry in fall; ustic regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  2.8 to 5.0 degrees C (37 to 41 degrees F)
Mean summer soil temperature:  10.6 to 14.4 degrees C (51 to 58 degrees F)
Depth to paralithic contact:  51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  18 to 28 to cm (7 to 11 inches)
Lithology of rock fragments: granodiorite, gneiss, schist

Particle-size control section (weighted averages):  
  Clay content:  12 to 18 percent
  Rock fragment content:  20 to 30 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Branham, Clergern, Danielvil, Dinnen, Levenmile, Redspoon, Sawcreek, Sula, and the Teoculli series.
Branham and Sawcreek soils have an ustic soil moisture regime that does not border aridic.
Clergern, Danielvil, Dinnen, Levenmile, Sula, and Teoculli soils are very deep.
Redspoon soils have 5YR and 2.5YR hues in the Bw horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from granodiorite, gneiss, and/or schist
Landform:  pediments
Slopes:  3 to 12 percent
Elevation:  2621 to 2835 meters (8600 to 9300 feet) 
Mean annual temperature:  1.7 to 3.9 degrees C (35 to 39 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  305 to 356 mm (12 to 14 inches)
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period:  50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Vorsid series.  The Vorsid soils are shallow and are on pediments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderately rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists mainly of Arizona fescue, western wheatgrass, prairie Junegrass, blue grama, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48B; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010.  The name is taken from Martland Peak and Martland Gulch nearby.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 86 cm. (0 to 34 inches)
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 61 cm.  (Bw3 horizon)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 25 cm.  (A, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with granodiorite at 61 cm.  (Cr layer)

The mineralogy is estimated to be mixed rather than micaeous; this has not been verified with lab data.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
This pedon was sampled for NSSL; soil survey sample number S92-CO-093-001.
