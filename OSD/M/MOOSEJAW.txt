MOOSEJAW SERIES 

The Moosejaw series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in moderately coarse alluvium from mixed sources over coarse alluvium from granite or other coarse grained, igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on floodplains and drainageways in foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Cumulic Cryaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Moosejaw mucky peat in wetlands (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 5 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) mucky peat, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderately decomposed herbaceous material and trapped sediment; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear, smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Ag--5 to 24 inches; black (N 2.5/ ) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate, medium and coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, common medium,  and few coarse roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 2 percent subrounded gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear, smooth boundary. (16 to 30 inches thick)

    Cg--24 to 43 inches; black (5Y 2.5/1) stratified loam, silt loam and sandy loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium and coarse roots; 2 percent subrounded gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (14 to 42 inches thick)

    2C--43 to 72 inches; olive (5Y 4/4) gravelly loamy coarse sand, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) dry; single grain; loose, non-sticky and non-plastic; few very fine roots; abundant interstitial pores; 30 percent subangular fine gravel; few medium distinct dark gray (5Y 4/1) redoximorphic depletions; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dobrow and Hopeval series.  Dobrow soils contain rock fragments that are mainly  to 10 inches in diameter with limited amounts of fine pea gravel and receive 10 inches of precipitation.  Hopeval soils have a xeric soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - floodplains and drainageways in foothills and mountains
Elevation - 5,360 to 7,860 feet
Slope - 0 to 15 percent
Parent material - moderately coarse alluvium from mixed sources over coarse grained alluvium from granite or other coarse grained, igneous or metamorphic rocks
Climate - long cold winters; moist cool springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 40 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

These are the Shewag, Mooseflat, and Pappascreek series.  Shewag soils are shallow to coarse sand and gravel and generally occur adjacent to creeks, on old gravel bars.  Mooseflat soils are 14 to 26 inches to coarse sand and gravel substrates and occur on similar landform positions as the Moosejaw series.  Pappascreek soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on slightly higher positions on floodplains, low terraces and along mountain drainages.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; moderately rapid over rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Moosejaw soils are primarily used for wetlands and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly water sedge, Northwest Territory sedge, Drummond willow or geyer and Booths willow, bluejoint reedgrass, horsetails, and mountain alder.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Moosejaw soils are of limited extent in foothills and mountains of southwestern Montana. MLRA 43.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Silver Bow County, Montana, 2006.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a surface layer of moderately decomposed plant material from 0 to 5 inches (Oe horizon); a mollic epipedon from 5 to 43 inches (Ag, Bg horizons); coarse sand and gravel substrates below 43 inches (2C horizon); a particle-size control section from 15 to 45 inches (Ag, Cg, and 2C horizons). Moosejaw soils have a cryic temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.  Gravels throughout the profile are primarily fine pea gravel less than 7 mm in diameter.
