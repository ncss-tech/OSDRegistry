MOCMONT SERIES 

The Mocmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium weathered from argillite, igneous rock, or sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mocmont very gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--2 inches to 0; forest litter of undecomposed and partially decomposed needles, twigs, cones, and leaves.

(Combined Bt horizons is 8 to 45 inches thick.) 

    BC--38 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, very fine, and few medium roots; many very fine pores; 45 percent angular cobbles, 40 percent angular pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fergus County, Montana, 1979. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0387, MT8098, MT8185, MT0897, MT1069.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an albic horizon from the soil surface to 9 inches (E horizon); a glossic horizon from 9 to 12 inches (E/Bt horizon); an argillic horizon from 12 to 38 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 12 to 32 inches (Bt1, part of Bt2 horizons).  Mocmont soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
