MOCMONT SERIES 

The Mocmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium weathered from argillite, igneous rock, or sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mocmont very gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 6 cm; forest litter of undecomposed and partially decomposed needles, twigs, cones, and leaves. 

    E--6 to 29 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many medium, fine, very fine, and few coarse roots; many very fine pores; 30 percent angular pebbles, 10 percent angular cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 41 cm thick) 

    E/Bt--29 to 36 cm; E part (75 percent) very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist tongues; B part (25 percent) light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly heavy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many medium, fine, very fine, and common coarse roots; many fine and very fine pores; 35 percent angular pebbles, 15 percent angular cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt1--36 to 67 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine, common medium and coarse roots; many fine and very fine pores; continuous distinct clay film on faces of peds; common faint clay film on rock fragments; 50 percent angular pebbles, 20 percent angular cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--67 to 103 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots, and few coarse roots; many fine and very fine pores; many faint thin clay films on faces of peds; common faint clay film on rock fragments; 55 percent angular pebbles, 25 percent angular cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); diffuse wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons--20 to 114 cm.) 

    BC--103 to 158 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, very fine, and few medium roots; many very fine pores; 45 percent angular cobbles, 40 percent angular pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).
