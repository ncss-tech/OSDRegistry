MINERALKING SERIES

The Mineralking series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and reworked till derived from metamorphic rocks. The Mineralking soils are on glacial-valley walls and mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Humixerepts

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bindle (MLRA 6) soils. Bindle soils have mafic volcanic bedrock between 50 and 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mineralking soils are on linear backslopes of talus slopes and colluvial aprons of glacial-valley walls, and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and reworked till from metamorphic and, less commonly, granitic rocks. Elevation is 1955 to 3175 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 520 to 1230 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 2 to 9 degrees C. The frost free season is 80 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Marmot soils. The Marmot soils are on convex backslopes of mountain slopes and have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is red fir, Sierra lodgepole pine, and white fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
