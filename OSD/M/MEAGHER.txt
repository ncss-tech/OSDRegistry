MEAGHER SERIES

The Meagher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, eroded fan remnants and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Meagher loam, 2 percent slope in nonirrigated cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 15 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--15 to 38 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; continuous distinct brown (10YR 5/3) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk1--38 to 74 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, many distinct and faint coatings of calcium carbonate on faces of peds, and common fine masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

    2Bk2--74 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and continuous faint calcium carbonate coatings on gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
