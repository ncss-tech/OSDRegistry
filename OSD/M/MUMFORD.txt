MUMFORD SERIES

The Mumford series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and alluvium from limestone with some loess influence.  They are on ridges and hillsides.  Permeability is moderate.  Mumford soils have slopes of 1 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Calcixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Mumford very gravelly silt loam, rangeland; on a 30 percent south-facing slope at 6,460 feet elevation.  When described on September 5, 1991, the soil was dry throughout. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular and irregular and few medium vesicular pores; strongly effervescent  (35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 20mm fraction); disseminated lime;  35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk1--3 to 6 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and few fine irregular and tubular pores; strongly effervescent (49 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 20mm fraction); disseminated lime; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk2--6 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent (48 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 20mm fraction); 40 percent of rock fragments have undersides coated with lime; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear irregular boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk3--12 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent (55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent - less than 20mm fraction); all coarse fragments coated on all sides with lime; 70 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

    R--17 inches; limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mumford soils are on ridges and hillsides.  Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 7,650 feet.  The soil formed in residuum and alluvium from limestone with some loess influence.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches, average annual air temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F., and the frost free period is 65 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lonjon and Sprollow soils.  Lonjon soils have mollic epipedons and are moderately deep to bedrock.  Sprollow soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Lonjon soils are on north-facing slopes and concave areas.  Sprollow soils are on similar positions as Mumford, but are on slightly lower, concave slopes when associated with Mumford soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mumford soils are used for rangeland.  The native vegetation is alkali sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent. 43B

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008.  The name is taken from a ranch in the area where the soil was first mapped.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 3 inches (the A horizon).

Calcic horizon - the zone from 3 to 17 inches (the Bk1, Bk2, and the Bk3 horizons).
