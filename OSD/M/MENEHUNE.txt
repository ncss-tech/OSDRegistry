MENEHUNE SERIES

The Menehune series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash deposited over pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1,295 millimeters (51 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial, amorphic, isomesic Lithic Hapludands

TYPICAL PEDON: Menehune medial sandy loam, 12 percent slope, under scattered ohia trees and shrubs at an elevation of 1,600 meters (5,260 feet). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on 5/20/99 the soil was slightly moist throughout the subsoil.  The soil temperature was 19 degrees C. (66 degrees F.) at a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches).  All textures are "apparent field textures".  pH was determined by adjusting field organic dye values via regression to approximate pH in 1:1 water.)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Kaholimo series.  The Kaholimo soils have Bw horizons and do not have lithochromic colors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Menehune soils are on Kilauea pahoehoe flows less than 750 years old at elevations of 1,219 to 2,135 meters (4,000 to 7,000 feet).  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent; micro-slopes range from 20 to 35 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is 1,270 to 1,524 millimeters (50 to 60 inches), with about 75 percent of the rainfall occurring between October and April.  The mean annual pan evaporation is 1,270 to 1,524 millimeters (50 to 60 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C. (50 to 57 degrees F.).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kulalio, Oneula, and Puiwa soils.  Kulalio and Oneula soils are skeletal and overlie `a`a lava.  Puiwa soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Runoff is high.  Permeability is rapid in the soil and very slow in the underlying pahoehoe bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for National Park Service land.  Vegetation is aalii (Dodonaea viscosa), ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), uki (Machaerina angustifolia), and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils occur within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and neighboring ranches; MLRA 160.  The series is of small extent.
