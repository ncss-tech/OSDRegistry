MAURICE SERIES

The Maurice series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, outwash plains, ground moraines and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maurice stony loam, meadow hayland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist coatings; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; 5 percent gravel, 0.05 percent stones on surface; neutral (pH 7.2); clear boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; black (10YR 2/1) coatings, moist; weak medium prisms parting to moderate medium and fine blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw1--13 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; 10 percent cobbles, 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual boundary. (11 to 19 inches thick)

    Bw2--24 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearmouth and Thiel soils. Bearmouth soils are sandy-skeletal. Thiel soils have an argillic horizon. These soils are on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Maurice soils are used mainly for meadow hayland and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, Idaho fescue, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Maurice soils are of limited extent in the mountains of south central and western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carbon County (Bridger Area), Montana, 1971.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0344, MT0769, and MT0830.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 13 inches (A1 and A2 horizons); a cambic horizon from 13 to 60 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (part of A2, Bw1, and part of Bw2 horizons).  Maurice soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
