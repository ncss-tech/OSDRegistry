MAXCREEK SERIES

The Maxcreek series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in 65 to 102 centimeters of loess or silty sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till.  These soils are on linear or concave slopes on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.
