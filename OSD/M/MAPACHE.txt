MAPACHE SERIES


The Mapache series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from latite and dacite.  Mapache soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 10 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adellern, Braziel, Fessler, Pastorius, Pastorpeak, and Zillion.  Adellern soils are derived from granite and have accumulations of secondary carbonates.  Braziel and Fessler soils receive more moisture in May and June. In addition, Fessler soils have accumulations of secondary carbonates. astorius soils have sandy-skeletal substratum.  Pastorpeak soils are derived from granite and sandstone, have accumulations of secondary carbonates, and are fragmental in the substratum.  Zillion soils have accumulations of secondary carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mapache soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from latite and dacite of the Tertiary age Tschicoma Formation. Slopes are 10 to 55 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,600 to 10,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 24 to 32 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Estaban and Lucito soils. Estaban soils are fragmental, do not have a mollic epipedon, and occur on steep canyon backslopes.  Lucito soils are clayey skeletal and occur on mountain footslopes and toeslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mapache soils are used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Present vegetation is Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, white fir, quaking aspen, Thurber's fescue, nodding brome, Parry's oatgrass, and western yarrow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mapache soils are of small extent on the Jemez Volcanic Field part of the Southern Rocky Mountain province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 48A.
