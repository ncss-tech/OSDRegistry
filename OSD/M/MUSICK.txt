MUSICK SERIES

The Musick series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum from intrusive igneous rocks. Musick soils are on foothills and mountains. Slope ranges from 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Musick loam--on a northeast-facing, linear, slope of 26 percent. Vegetation is ponderosa pine, incense cedar, and California black oak with mountain misery, whiteleaf manzanita and deerbrush in the understory. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on July 3, 1958 the soil was dry throughout).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Wallyhill soils. Wallyhill soils have a paralithic contact of metasedimentary rock at depths of 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Musick soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations of 495 to 1480 meters. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. These soils formed in material derived from intrusive igneous rocks such as granite, granodiorite, quartz diorite, or syenite. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 750 to 1800 mm, of which 1 to 15 percent occurs as snow. Mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C, average January air temperature is 3 degrees C, and average July air temperature is 22 degrees C. Frost-free season is 180 to 260 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aiken, Chawanakee, Cohasset, Holland, Hotaw, Jocal, Shaver, Sites, Tollhouse and Wukusick soils. Chawanakee and Tollhouse have a paralithic contact with intrusive igneous rock at 25 to 50 cm. Hotaw soils occur on shoulders and have a paralithic contact with intrusive igneous rock at 50 to 100 cm. Shaver soils have a paralithic contact with intrusive igneous rock at 100 to 150 cm. Aiken, Jocal, and Sites soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent (by sum of cations) in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Aiken soils occur on lahars. Jocal and Sites soils occur on mountain slopes and formed from metasedimentary rocks. Sites and Wukusick soils average greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high throughout the soil profile. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for commercial timber, wildlife, watershed, and recreation. A few areas are used for deciduous orchards and pasture. Vegetation includes ponderosa pine, incense cedar, white fir, California black oak, canyon live oak, Pacific dogwood, mountain misery, whiteleaf manzanita and deerbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. The series is moderately extensive.
