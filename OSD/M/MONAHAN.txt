MONAHAN SERIES

The Monahan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from shale.  Monahan soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic Ustollic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Monahan gravelly loam, on a 6 percent slope in grassland at an elevation of 9,350 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on July 23, 1981.

       A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 16 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

       A2--4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; 16 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 6 to 8 inches)

       BA--8 to 13 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 16 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

       Bt2--19 to 33 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 18 to 24 inches)

       Bk--33 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; very hard, friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine carbonate masses in the matrix; 4 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). (18 to 30 inches thick)

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010.  The name was taken from nearby Monahan Gulch. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 13 to 23 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  from 0 to 8 inches.  (A1, A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  from 13 to 33 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Secondary carbonates: from 33 to 60 inches. (Bk horizon)

The mineralogy class is unconfirmed. Where this soil is mapped over Pierre shale in Park County it is possibly mixed rather than smectitic.
