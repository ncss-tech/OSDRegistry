MAHASKA SERIES

The Mahaska series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on summits of interfluves on dissected till plains and on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).
