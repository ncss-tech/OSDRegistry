USE: General farm and truck crops, with some livestock farms producing hay and pasture.  Locally, tobacco is a very important crop, particularly in Southern Maryland.

VEGETATION: Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods, dominated by oaks, with hickory, yellow poplar, and dogwood common.  Cutover areas may have shortleaf, Virginia, or loblolly pine, but usually only in scattered stands.
