MANTLEMINE SERIES

The Mantlemine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from interbedded limestone and sandstone.  Mantlemine soils are on structural benches, alluvial fans, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Mantlemine loam , on a 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6,390 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 14, 1994 the soil was dry throughout.

The surface is covered by 5 percent sandstone gravel.

A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate thin and medium platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

A2--2 to 5 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure parting to weak thick platy; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

Bt--5 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

Btk--20 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; very few faint clay films on faces of peds; calcium carbonate disseminated; strongly effervescent; 9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick)

Bk1--25 to 45 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common fine irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; violently effervescent; 19 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 25 to 40 inches)

Bk2--45 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; calcium carbonate disseminated; strongly effervescent; 11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
