REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 4 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon- the zone from 4 inches to a depth of 80 inches
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
