MOHON SERIES

The Mohon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rocks.  Mohon soils are on fan terraces with slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mohon very cobbly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 30 percent cobble and 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.   (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bk--2 to 6 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common fine soft calcium carbonate filaments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Btk1--6 to 25 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and in pores; 2 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; few fine soft calcium carbonate masses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 36 inches thick)

    Btk2--25 to 40 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces and in pores; strongly effervescent, 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 2 percent gravel; common medium soft calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    2Btk3--40 to 47 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) cobbly clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on ped faces and in pores; 10 percent cobble and 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; common soft calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.

    2Btk4--47 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) cobbly clay loam, pink (7.5YR 7/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and in pores; 10 percent cobble and 20 percent gravel; violently effervescent, 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; many soft large calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline (8.4).  (Combined thickness of the 2Btk horizons is 0 to 36 inches)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mohon soils are on fan terraces within the Mohave Desert.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from volcanic rocks.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 3,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 200 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cellar, Dudleyville, Kinley,  Poachie, Stagecoach, Vekol and Vinton soils.  Cellar soils are shallow to bedrock.  Vekol soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Kinley, Stagecoach and Poachie soils are loamy or loamy-skeletal.  Dudleyville and Vinton soils are sandy-skeletal and sandy, respectively.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes big galleta, bush muhly, black grama, creosotebush, white bursage and flattop buckwheat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 30.  Name is from a local mountain range.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Mohave County, Arizona; Soil survey of Mohave County, Arizona, Southern Part; 2005.

REMARKS:  In 2005, the classification of the Mohon Series was changed to reflect the presence of a calcic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 6 to 60 inches (Btk1, Btk2, 2Btk3, 2Btk4 horizons)

Calcic horizon - The zone from 25 to 60 inches (Btk2, 2Btk3, 2Btk4 horizons)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003

Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 11/2015. The last revision to the series was 6/2005. ET
