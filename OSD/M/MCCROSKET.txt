MCCROSKET SERIES 

The McCrosket series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed on mountains and foothills. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite, that is influenced with mixed volcanic ash and loess in the surface layers. Slopes range from 5 to about 65 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McCrosket soils are on mountains and footslopes. They occupy northerly aspects at lower elevations, and they occupy southerly aspects and ridgetops at higher elevations. Slopes range from 5 percent to 65 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with a mantle of loess mixed with minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 2200 to 4000 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is from 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ardenvoir, Huckle, Tekoa, and Rasser soils. Ardenvoir soils have an ochric epipedon and occupy all aspects of adjacent mountains and foothills. Huckle soils have thick volcanic ash mantles and occupy northerly aspects on adjacent mountains and foothills. Tekoa soils have an argillic horizon, are moderately deep, and occupy convex positions on southerly aspects. Rasser soils are very deep, have an ochric epipedon, and occupy easterly aspects on linear positions of adjacent foothills and mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for timber production with limited grazing. Potential natural overstory vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine with an understory of creambush oceanspray, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, spirea, rose and pinegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho and eastern Washington. MLRA 43A and 9.  The series is moderately extensive.

Classification revised 2/2009 from loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Ultic Haploxerolls to loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerolls based on MLRA 43A investigations in Benewah County Area, Idaho (ID620), Latah County, Idaho (ID057), and Spokane County, Washington (WA075). Type location was moved to present location in 2007 to better reflect modal concept.
