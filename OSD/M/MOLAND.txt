MOLAND SERIES

The Moland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 35 to 60 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till. These soils are on convex slopes on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A, Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, and 2Bw4 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A, Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, 2Bw4, 2Bw5, and 2C horizons). 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 124 centimeters (Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, 2Bw4, and 2Bw5 horizons); 
udic moisture regime

In parts of MLRA 103 this drainage class is called moderately well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual. Drainage class is a state interpretation. 

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
