MASON SERIES

The Mason series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from silty alluvium of Pleistocene Age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad flood plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Pachic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Mason silt loam-in a cultivated field on a stream terrace, at an elevation of 215 meters (705 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Bt1--36 to 56 centimeters (14 to 22 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; patchy clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [15 to 56 centimeters (6 to 22 inches) thick)]

   Bt2--56 to 76 centimeters (22 to 30 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; nearly  continuous clay films on faces of peds; few dark-colored concretions; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) thick]

   BC--76 to 122 centimeters (30 to 48 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  [20 to 58 centimeters (8 to 23 inches) thick)]

   C--122 to 165 centimeters (48 to 65 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; massive; hard, firm; moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on stream terraces or benches of flood plains on river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvial materials of Pleistocene Age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1194 mm (32 to 47 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.6 to 17 degrees C (51 to 63 degrees F).  Elevation is 144.8 to 388.6 m (475 to 1275 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E index is 64 to 78.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Caspiana, Garton, Muldrow, Okay, Pledger, and Roebuck soils along rivers and the Lighting, Osage, Radley, Verdigris, and Wynona soils on major creeks in lower positions.  Caspina soils are higher and closer to the river.  Garton soils are slightly lower, have a fine control section and farther from the river.  Muldrow, Pledger, and Roebuck soils are farther from the river in back swamp positions and have a fine control section.  Okay soils occur on terraces and do not have a mollic epipedon more than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick.  Osage soils have a fine control section.  Radley, Verdigris, and Wynona soils do not contain an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well and moderately well drained.  Potential for surface runoff is low to medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.  Mason series is subject to rare flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated cropland.  Principal crops are alfalfa, grain sorghums, soybeans, and small grains.  Some areas are used for tame pasture.  Native vegetation is mixed forest of elm, oak, hackberry, and pecan, and tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 76, 84A, 112, 117 in southeastern Kansas and northeast Oklahoma.  The series is moderately extensive.
