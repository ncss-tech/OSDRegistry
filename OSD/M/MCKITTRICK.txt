MCKITTRICK SERIES

The McKittrick series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).      

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: McKittrick gravelly sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,560 m (5,118 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).            

    A--0 to 12 cm, (0 to 5 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; 10 percent subrounded very strongly cemented 76 to 250 mm limestone fragments and 15 percent subrounded very strongly cemented 2 to 75 mm limestone fragments; strongly effervescent; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 34 cm [3 to 13 in])            

    Bw--12 to 41 cm, (5 to 16 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; finely disseminated carbonates; 15 percent subrounded very strongly cemented 76 to 250 mm limestone fragments and 30 percent subrounded very strongly cemented 2 to 75 mm limestone fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bk horizon is 13 to 35 cm [5 to 14 in])                         

    BC--41 to 157 cm, (16 to 62 in); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4), moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and common medium and coarse roots; finely disseminated carbonates; 35 percent subrounded very strongly cemented 2 to 75 mm limestone fragments and 45 percent subrounded very strongly cemented 76 to 250 mm limestone fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.
