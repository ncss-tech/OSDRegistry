MILLENIUM SERIES

The Millenium series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian materials and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. Millenium soils are on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashdos, Ashtre, Lastcall, and Stauffer series. 

Ashdos and Ashtre soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Lastcall soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Stauffer soils have horizons with up to 45 percent durinodes. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millenium soils are on lakebeds. These soils formed in eolian materials and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,332 to 1,525 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is  230 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Stauffer soil and the Borobey, Raztack, and Senra soils. Borobey soils do not have argillic horizons, average 8 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have noncemented horizons which are firm and brittle. Raztack soils are fine, deep to duripans, and have ochric epipedons. Senra soils are shallow to duripans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low or negligible surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Millenium soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly basin big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, Thurber's needlegrass, and gray rabbitbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are not extensive with about 1,700 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.
