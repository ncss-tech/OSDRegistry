MALCOLM SERIES

The Malcolm series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in interglacial sediments of Aftonian age.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Malcolm silt loam, with a 6 percent west-facing slope in pasture.  (Colors are for moist conditions unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 7 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard; friable; few fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

   Bt1--7 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

   Bt2--12 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; strong fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common very dark grayish brown organic or clay coatings on faces of peds; very few fine roots; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

   BC--20 to 28 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam; pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; few coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few iron concretions; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

   C--28 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silt loam; pale yellow (2.5Y 8/2) dry; massive; common horizontal planes of cleavage; slightly hard; very friable, moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Otoe County, Nebraska; about 2 1/2 miles north and 1 mile east of Burr; 1670 feet north and 125 feet east of the southwest corner, sec. 14, T. 7 N., R. 10 E.  USGS Burr topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees, 34 minutes, 16 seconds North and longitude 96 degrees, 16 minutes, 26 seconds West.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashdale, Broadwell, Catlin, Cotter, Dinsdale, Douglas, Elmont, Healing, Lycurgus, Meadowbank, Mendota, Ogle, Plano, Proctor, Richwood, Ripon, Sibley, Sidell, Tama, Tecumseh, Toddville, Troxel, Wakenda, Waupecan, and Wiota series.  Ashdale soils formed in thinner loess; the lower part of the solum formed in residuum weathered from limestone and limestone bedrock is at depths of 3 to 5 feet.  
Broadwell, Catlin, Plano, Proctor, Richwood, Sidell, and Toddville soils all have more sand in their lower sola.  Cotter, Sibley, and Troxel soils have thicker mollic epipedons.  
Dinsdale soils have loam or clay loam glacial till within a depth of 40 inches.  
Douglas soils have lower base saturation in the B horizon.  Elmont soils have more clay in the lower part of the B horizon and C horizons of weathered shale.  
Healing soils typically have redder B horizons and contain pebbles in the lower B and C horizons.  
Lycurgus, Meadowbank, Tecumseh and Wakenda soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick and are in an area with higher precipitation.  
Mendota soils have glacial till within a depth of 40 inches.  Ogle soils have a lower solum formed in glacial till.  Ripon soils have limestone bedrock within 40 inches.  
Waupecan soils have a drier control section and formed in sandy and gravelly outwash.  
Wiota soils have thicker mollic epipedons and contain more clay in the C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: Noncalcareous, interglacial sediments of Aftonian age, and occurs as transition between the loess and till in dissected loess mantled till plains.
Landform: Uplands
Slopes: 5 to 25 percent
Mean annual temperature: 51 to 54 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 26 to 34 inches
Frost-free period: 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Burchard, Filley, Mayberry, Morrill, and Steinauer soils occupying similar landscape positions.  Filley soils contain more sand.  Mayberry soils have redder hue and contain more clay in the B horizon.  
Morrill soils have redder hue and contain more sand in the sola.  
Burchard and Steinauer soils are formed in calcareous glacial till and contain more sand in the sola.  
Aksarben and Wymore soils occupy higher elevations and are formed in loess.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage: Well drained. 
Surface runoff: Medium or high. 
Permeability: Moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The less sloping areas are mostly used to grow sorghum, small grains, and forage legumes.  Steeper slopes are usually in range or pasture.  Native vegetation is mid and tall prairie grass, dominantly big bluestem, little bluestem, and indiangrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.
