COMPETING SERIES: These are the Beales, Chistna, Chistochina, Dureile, Gustavus, and Kismetpeak soils.
Kismetpeak soils are somewhat excessively drained, have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the mineral horizons, and lack a folistic epipedon.
Beals soils are somewhat excessively drained, do not have coarse fragments in the parent material, and occur on sandy hills and sandy plains.
Chistna soils are somewhat excessively drained, have a thin cambic horizon, and occur on glacial outwash 
Chistochina soils are somewhat excessively drained, has a silt loam surface texture, and darker colored parent material.
Dureile soils are well drained, a thin A horizon, and occur on outwash plains.
Gustavus soils are well drained, lack an A horizon, and occur on outwash deltas from 0 to 50 m in elevation.

Slatka soils are somewhat poorly drained, have permafrost, histic epipedons, cryoturbation, and occur on mountain slopes.
Tisa soils are somewhat excessively drained, have mollic epipedons, and occur on mountain terraces.
Tok soils are well drained, a fine sandy loam cambic horizon over gravelly till, and occur on kames and glacial valley floors.
