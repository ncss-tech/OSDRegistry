MEADOWPASS SERIES

The Meadowpass series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that are 20 to 40 inches deep over welded tuff bedrock.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from semi-consolidated welded tuff.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Meadowpass gravelly loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) gravelly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--3 to 9 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) gravelly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined A horizons - 7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt1--9 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2--12 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent gravel, 15 percent soft fragments; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt/C--18 to 30 inches; B part (60 percent) is light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) sandy clay, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; C part (40 percent) is pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) sandy clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots along prism faces; few tubular and interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 40 percent soft fragments; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

    Cr--30 inches; semi-consolidated welded tuff.
