MAKINEN SERIES

The Makinen series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, extremely acid soils in depressions on outwash plains, lake plains, ground moraines, and end moraines. The soils formed in herbaceous organic materials underlain by sandy deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, dysic, mesic Terric Haplosaprists

TYPICAL PEDON: Makinen muck, on a 1 percent slope under bog vegetation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on August 3, 1996, the soil was moist to a depth of 61 cm (24 inches) and saturated below.)

 Oa1--0 to 10 cm (4 inches); black (5YR 2.5/1) broken face, black (7.5YR 2.5/1) rubbed muck (sapric material); about 5 percent fiber, less than 5 percent rubbed; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Oa2--10 to 36 cm (4 to 14 inches); black (7.5YR 2.5/1) broken face and rubbed muck (sapric material); about 10 percent fiber, less than 5 percent rubbed; weak medium platy structure; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Oa3--36 to 56 cm (14 to 22 inches); black (7.5YR 2.5/1) broken face, black (5YR 2.5/1) rubbed muck (sapric material); about 20 percent fiber, 5 percent rubbed; weak medium subangular blocky structure; ultra acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Oa4--56 to 79 cm (22 to 31 inches); black (7.5YR 2.5/1) broken face and rubbed muck (sapric material); about 20 percent fiber, 10 percent rubbed; weak medium subangular blocky structure; ultra acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Oa horizon in 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches).]

 Cg--79 to 203 cm (31 to 80 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sand; single grain; very friable; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Manistee County, Michigan; about 4 miles southwest of the village of Copemish; 2,100 feet south and 1780 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 34, T. 24 N., R. 14 W., Springdale Township; USGS Copemish, Michigan topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 26 minutes 09 seconds N. and long. 85 degrees 59 minutes 09 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the C horizon: 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches)
Organic fibers: derived primarily from herbaceous plants
Wood fragment content: less than 15 percent by volume in the control section

Surface tier:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 0 to 3
Organic material: dominantly muck (sapric material); some pedons have a thin mat of sphagnum moss on the surface that is 2.5 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) thick
Reaction: ultra acid to very strongly acid

Subsurface and bottom tiers:
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR, or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 0 to 3
Organic material: dominantly muck (sapric material); some pedons have thin layers less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick of mucky peat (hemic material) or thin layers less than 13 cm (5 inches) thick of peat (fibric material) 
Reaction: ultra acid to very strongly acid

In some pedons a layer of coprogenous earth (sedimentary peat) 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) thick is present above the C horizon.

C horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 5Y
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sand

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Swansea series. Swansea soils receive more than 813 mm of mean annual precipitation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Makinen soils are in shallow closed depressions primarily on outwash plains and lake plains, but can occur on end moraines and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Makinen soils formed in herbaceous organic materials underlain by sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 cm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 9.4 degrees C (47 to 49 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brethren, Kaleva, Copemish, and Lumley soils. The Brethren, Kaleva and Copemish soils are sandy and are on associated landforms. The Lumley soils are in nearby depressions where the organic deposits are deeper.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to (1 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic materials and high or very high in the sand deposits. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic materials and rapid in the sandy deposits. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in native vegetation. Native trees included tamarack, black spruce, and white pine. Understory vegetation includes leatherleaf, cranberries, sphagnum moss, cotton grass, bog rosemary, blueberries, and pitcher plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
