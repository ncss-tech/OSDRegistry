MILARCH SERIES

The Milarch series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains and deltas. They formed in loamy lacustrine deposits and the underlying sandy lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Milarch loam, on a convex, 2 percent slope in a formerly cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 inches) thick]

[Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 inches).]

 2E and Bt1--76 to 99 cm (30 to 39 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) loamy sand (E); lamellae of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt); weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; very few fine roots; few patchy brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds in lamellae; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the upper part of each lamellae; lamella are 6 to 19 mm (1/4 to 3/4 inch) thick and are 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) apart; total thickness of the lamellae is 5 cm (2 inches); neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [0 to 30 cm (12 inches) thick]

 2E and Bt2--99 to 254 cm (39 to 100 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand (E); single grain; loose in the E part; lamellae of strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) loamy sand and sandy loam (Bt); weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable in the Bt part; patchy faint clay bridging between sand grains in lamellae; lamella are 3 to 13 cm (1/8 to 1/2 inch) thick and are an average 8 cm (3 inches) apart; total thickness of the lamellae in 10 cm (4 inches); neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Milarch soils are on lake plains and deltas of Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in loamy lacustrine deposits and the underlying sandy lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. Elevation is 183 to 274 meters (600 to 900 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The excessively drained Coloma and Plainfield soils and the well drained Tatches soils are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) for 30 or more days between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high over high or very high. Permeability is moderately slow over rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested or idle. Native vegetation is sugar maple, northern red oak, American basswood, and American beech. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
