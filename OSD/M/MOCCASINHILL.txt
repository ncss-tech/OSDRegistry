MOCCASINHILL SERIES

The Moccasinhill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from phyllite, slate, schist, or other metasedimentary rocks. The Moccasinhill soils are on canyons and hills. Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 830 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, thermic Humic Haploxerepts

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Moccasinhill soils are on canyons and hills. Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum weathered from phyllite, slate, schist, or other metasedimentary rocks. Elevation is 300 to 915 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 650 to 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 180 to 295 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Copperopolis, Sanguinetti, Millvilla, and Deerflat soils. The Copperopolis soils are on - hills, andhave a lithic contact within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface. The Sanguinetti soils are on sideslopes of canyons and hills and are 50 to 100cm to a lithic contact. Millvilla (sideslopes) and Deerflat (footslopes) occupy hills and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity, medium to very high runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is chamise, foothill pine, toyon, whiteleaf manzanita, buckbrush, Pacific poison oak, soft chess, wild oat and California poppy.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. These soils are moderately extensive.
