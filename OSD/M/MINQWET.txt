MINQWET SERIES

The Minqwet series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum derived from calcareous shale and limestone.  Minqwet soils are on hills, ridges and pediments in the plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Series control section: 0 to 101 centimeters (0 to 40 inches)
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 76 centimeters (10 to 30 inches).  (Part or all of the Bw1, Bw2, and Bky horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches).  (A horizons)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 15 t0 53 centimeters (6 to 21 inches).  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with shale and soft limestone at 76 centimeters (30 inches).  (Cr horizon)
Other features:  aridic ustic moisture regime and 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout. 

Remarks:  This soil was part of the Minnequa series but was determined to have a cambic horizon and to have and aridic ustic moisture regime.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample numbers S87CO-071-010.
