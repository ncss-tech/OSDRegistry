MCGEE SERIES

The McGee series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly or moderately well drained soils formed in till and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. McGee soils are on lateral and ground moraines in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1030 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Stehekin soils. Stehekin soils are well-drained, lack redoximorphic features, and do not have a densic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The McGee soils are on swales of ground and lateral moraines on glacial valley floors, basin floors, mountain slopes, cirques, and glacial valley walls. Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent. These soils formed in till and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. Elevation is 2260 to 3900 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 550 to 1620 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -1 to 5 degrees C. The frost free season is 50 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Evolution and Siberian soils. The Evolution soils are on ground moraines and occupy slightly higher, less concave positions than do McGee soils. Evolution soils are also sandy-skeletal, and have a densic contact between 100 and 150 cm of the mineral soil surface. The Siberian soils are on backslopes and footslopes of moraines, are sandy-skeletal, and do not have redoximorphic features in the series control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well or somewhat poorly drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the densic material is low to moderately low in the densic layer; frequent ponding for brief duration beginning in May. Seasonal high water table at 20 to 100 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is lodgepole pine with an understory of mountain heather and dwarf bilberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. The series is not extensive.
