MCLENNAN SERIES

The McLennan series consists of very deep to loamy shale, siltstone, and flaggy limestone. These well drained soils formed in residuum derived from shale, claystone, or siltstone interbedded with flaggy limestone of Upper Cretaceous Age.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on steep ridges on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 892 mm (35.1 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.6 degrees C (65.5 degrees F).

Altoga soils: do not contain flaggy fragments of limestone or dense substrata and typically occur on old high terraces, footslopes and alluvial fans. 
Howe soils: have a paralithic contact to chalk.  
Austin and Lott soils: have mollic epipedons.  
Brackett, Cranfill, Lamar, and Seawillow soils: are in a fine-loamy family, in addition, Lamar soils have less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  
Cuthand soils: are in a coarse-silty family.  
Ellis soils: are in a fine family, have vertic properties, and are noncalcareous.  
Kerrville soils: contain more than 5 percent fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Well; 
Permeability class: Moderately slow
Runoff: medium on 3 to 5 percent slopes and high on 5 to 20 percent slopes.
 
USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture as well as cropland.  The main grasses are common and improved bermudagrass and K.R. bluestem.  Native vegetation includes little bluestem, silver bluestem, sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass and a few scattered elm and oak trees.  Small grain and grain sorghum are the main crops grown.
