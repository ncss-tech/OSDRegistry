MCKNIGHT SERIES

The McKnight series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable over slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium over loamy or clayey material derived from Permian age redbed sediments.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on thin alluvium over claystone bedrock on dissected stream terraces on alluvial plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arnett, Cobb, Decobb, and Grandmore series.  Similar soils are the Grandfield, Honeycreek, Hye, Lou, Menard, Rochelle, and Seagraves series.
Arnett and Rochelle series: These soils are very deep to bedrock and contain more than 5 percent siliceous gravel within the solum.
Cobb, Hye, and Lou series: These soils are less than 40 inches deep to paralithic or lithic bedrock and do not contain a discontinuity within the solum.
Decobb, Grandfield, and Menard series: These soils are very deep to bedrock and do not contain a discontinuity within the solum.
Grandmore and Seagraves series: These soils are very deep to bedrock.
Honeycreek series: These soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to paralithic schist or gneiss bedrock and may contain up to 35 percent siliceous gravel in the subsoil.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: The upper part of the soil formed in loamy alluvial or eolian sediments of Pleistocene age over material derived from claystone or sandstone bedrock of Permian age.
Landform: Dissected stream terraces on alluvial plains. These soils formed in stream terrace sediments that were deposited over a pediment and have since been dissected leaving a thin mantle of alluvial/eolian sediments over bedrock.
Slope: 0 to 5 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 57 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation range: 20 to 28 inches
Frost-free period: 185 to 230 days
Elevation: 1000 to 2200 feet
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 32 to 44

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Burford, Devol, Grandfield, Grandmore, and Tilvern series.
Burford and Tilvern series: These soils occur on similar positions, but are fine-silty and fine respectively in the particle-size control section.
Devol series: These soils occur on higher dunes, are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section, and do not contain a discontinuity within 40 inches.
Grandfield series: These soils occur on slightly higher positions and do not contain a discontinuity within 40 inches or bedrock within 60 inches.

Grandmore series: These soils occur on lower positions, are moderately well drained, and do not contain bedrock within 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and slow or moderately slow in the lower part.  Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes and medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mainly cultivated.  Cotton, wheat, sorghum, alfalfa, improved bermudagrass, and weeping lovegrass are the main crops.  Native vegetation is mid and tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Rolling Red Plains of southwestern Oklahoma and possibly northwest Texas; LRR H; MLRA 78B & 78C; Moderate extent

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Harmon County, OK, 1982. The name comes from an old town site near the type location.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 14 to 34 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt horizons)

ochric epipedon: 0 to 14 inches. (Ap horizon)

Argillic horizon: 14 to 36 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt horizons)

Densic contact: The contact with claystone bedrock at 52 inches. (2Cd horizon)

Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon. (29 inches)

Additional Comments: 
NSSL Data S03-OK-057-005 from this site shows that the clay content of the Bt2 and the 2Bt horizons has an absolute difference of 25.4 percent which meets the criteria for a contrasting particle-size class (fine-loamy over clayey) by 0.4 percent. This is within normal lab error and the particle-size class was left fine-loamy until lab analysis is performed to justify changing the classification.

The depth to bedrock was originally described as 30 to 50 inches and was changed to 40 to 60 inches to fit present depth classes.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S03-OK-057-005 from Harmon county, OK
