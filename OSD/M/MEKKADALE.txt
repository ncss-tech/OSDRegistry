MEKKADALE SERIES

The Mekkadale series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid rocks. Mekkadale soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.5 degrees C (64.5 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mekkadale soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 4 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid rocks. Elevations range from 930 to 1,020 meters (3,050 to 3,345 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C (62 to 68 degrees F). The frost-free season is 270 to 320 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coppermine, Corbilt, Edalph, Gocougs, Minhoyt, Pinkcan, Stranger and Werewolf soils. Corbilt, Edalph, Gocougs, Minhoyt, Pinkcan, and Werewolf soils are on similar landscape positions while Coppermine and Stranger soils are on adjacent hills and pediments. Coppermine and Werewolf soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections, and do not have a duripan. Corbilt, Edalph, Minhoyt and Stranger soils do not have an argillic horizon and have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Edalph soils are also very deep, sandy throughout the particle-size control section, and have a calcic horizon. In addition, Corbilt has a duripan beginning below 100 centimeters and Minhoyt has a duripan beginning at less than 18 centimeters. Stranger soils have a lithic contact between 8 and 25 centimeters. Gocougs soils have a petrocalcic horizon beginning below 50 centimeters and Pinkcan soils have a duripan beginning between 100 and 150 centimeters.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the duripan, moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity within the duripan and high saturated hydraulic conductivity below the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mekkadale soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly burrobush, creosote bush, range ratany and jojoba.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
