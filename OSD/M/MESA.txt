MESA SERIES

The Mesa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and alluvium. Mesa soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, mesas, and pediments. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Mesa loam - grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    BCk1--51 to 89 cm; pink (7.5YR 8/3) very gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many prominent calcium carbonate concretions and masses, and many carbonate coats on rock fragments; 40 percent gravel and cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); diffuse wavy boundary. (0 to 53 cm thick)

    BCk2--89 to 152 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common distinct calcium carbonate concretions and carbonate coats on rock fragments; 70 percent gravel and cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
