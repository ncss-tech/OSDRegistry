MIPOLOMOL SERIES

The Mipolomol series consists of very shallow or shallow to fractured bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from bedded shale and sandstone. Mipolomol soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Entic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Mipolomol channery loam, on the side of a mountain at an elevation of 1210 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A--0 to 12 inches (0 to 30 centimeters); brown (10YR 5/3) channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; 30 percent fine channers; 5 percent fine subangular soft pararock fragments; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 14 inches thick)

     Cr--12 to 20 inches (0 to 50 centimeters); highly fractured bedded shale with fractures 1 to 3 inches apart, and with about 5 to 10 percent soil in fractures with few very fine roots.

TYPE LOCATION: Ventura County, California; about one mile north of the junction of Highway 1 and Highway 23; 750 feet south of the northwest corner of section 29, T. 1 S., R. 21 W.; Latitude 34 degrees, 3 minutes, 26 seconds north and Longitude 118 degrees, 53 minutes, 37 seconds west; Triunfo Pass Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.
Soil moisture: Soil is moist in middle to late November to late May.

Depth to paralithic contact: 4 to 14 inches (10 to 35 centimeters).
Organic matter content: 2 to 4 percent slopes.

A horizon--10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3 and 10YR 3/2, 3/3 moist.
Clay percentage--18 to 27 percent.
Coarse fragments-15 to 35 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mipolomol soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from inter-bedded shale and sandstone. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 400 to 2510 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches, the mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F., and the frost free season is to 290 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cotharin (T) and Topanga(T) soils. Topanga soils have argillic horizons on the side slopes of hills and mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat, recreation, cattle production and building site development. Vegetation is Big Pod Ceonothus and Chamise.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ventura and Los Angeles County, California. The soil is
not extensive. MLRA 20.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES PROPOSED: Ventura County, California, 1999.

REMARKS: The series name is from a local, ancient American Indian village. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Mollic epipedon--The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 12 inches (A horizon).

Paralithic material--The zone from a depth of 12 inches to about 20 inches (Cr horizon)
