MOHAT SERIES

The Mohat series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains, mainly along the Colorado and Brazos Rivers.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1194 mm (47 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, hyperthermic Typic Udifluvents

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These soils include Brazoria, Clemville, and Norwood series.  
Brazoria soils: are clayey and are on slightly lower nearly level positions  
Norwood and Clemville soils: are on similar positions and are adjacent to areas of Mohat soils

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Runoff is negligible.  The soil is rarely flooded with flooding occurring less than 5 times within a 100 year period.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for cropland, pasture or orchards.  Crops grown are corn, cotton, sorghum, small grains, and peanuts.  Pasture areas are mainly improved bermudagrasses.  Native vegetation consist of mid and tall prairies grasses.  Trees include pecan, elm, hackberry, cottonwood, and live oak.  The ecological Site is Loamy Bottomland 25-44" PZ (R150AY534TX). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly along the Colorado River in Southeastern Texas.  Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A; The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Colorado County, Texas; 1997.  The Mohat series is named after the former community of Mohat located in the southeastern part of Colorado County.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Coarsewood and Yahola series.

Diagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in).  (Ap horizon)

Bw Horizon - 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in) has soil structure, but it does not meet the requirements for a cambic.  There is no evidence of removal of carbonates.  (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, Bw4, Bw5, and Bw6 horizons)

Fluventic Property - There is irregular distribution of organic carbon and stratification is present.
