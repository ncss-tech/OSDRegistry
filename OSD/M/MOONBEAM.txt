MOONBEAM SERIES

The Moonbeam series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt. Moonbeam soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Vitritorrandic Durixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Mopana series. Mopana soils do not have lithic contacts within 150 cm of the soil surface and are intermittently moist in the upper horizons due to summer convection storms. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moonbeam soils are on lava plateaus. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,250 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm, but ranges to 400 mm in some areas. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hayespring, Oatmanflat, Senra, and Sliptrack soils. Oatmanflat soils are ashy and deep to buried duripans. Hayespring and Sliptrack soils are moderately deep to duripans. Senra soils are ashy and have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Moonbeam soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is low sagebrush, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, and western juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are extensive with about 123,000 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 23.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizons). 
Vitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizons). 
Argillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 46 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 
Duripan - The zone from 46 to 69 cm (Bqkm horizon). 
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 46 to 69 cm (Bqkm horizon). 
Lithic contact - The boundary at 69 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer). 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 46 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Volcanic glass content determined locally by optical grain counts using a polarizing petrographic microscope. Oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half oxalate extractable iron values are estimated.
