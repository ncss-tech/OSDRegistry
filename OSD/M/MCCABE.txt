MCCABE SERIES 

The Mccabe series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Aeric Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mccabe loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, in pasture (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular  pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    C1--2 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick) 

    C2--4 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

    C3--9 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam consisting of strata of loam, fine sandy loam and sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) dry redox concentrations; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick) 

    C4--16 to 36 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam consisting of strata of loam and fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) dry redox concentrations; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 27 inches thick) 

    2C5--36 to 60 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry, single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 20 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
