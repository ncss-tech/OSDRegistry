MENBO SERIES

The Menbo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash, residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Menbo soils are on hills, mountains, plateaus, and ravines. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Menbo stony ashy loam--on a 12 percent north-facing hillslope in sagebrush steppe at an elevation of 1,495 meters--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(5 to 20 cm thick) 

    A2--8 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly ashy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many roots; many irregular pores; about 5 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Menbo soils are on hills, mountains, plateaus, and ravines. They typically occur on north-facing backslope positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash, residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,680 meters in Oregon and up to 2,230 meters in Nevada. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 300 to 380 mm but ranges to 250 mm in some areas (North Lake County, Oregon). The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Redcliff, Stookmoor, and Westbutte soils. Redcliff soils are loamy-skeletal, have cambic horizons, and have an aridic moisture regime. Stookmoor soils are ashy, do not have argillic horizons, and have an aridic moisture regime. Westbutte soils are loamy-skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Menbo soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Thurber's needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon, northeastern California, and northwestern Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 23, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 10.
