MACYFLET SERIES

The Macyflet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived mainly from volcanic rocks.  Macyflet soils are on interplateau basins.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Paleargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Macyflet silty clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring; dry from July through October.  Saturated below 150 cm in most years, in the early spring; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 76 to 150 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Macyflet soils are on interplateau basins.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived mainly from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,740 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Boulder Lake soil.  Boulder Lake soils have vertical cracks that open to the surface in most years and are saturated for at least one month in most years.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 150 and 180 cm (very deep free water occurrence class) between December and May. Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Macyflet soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush and Sandberg's bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and south-central Oregon.  These soils are not extensive with about 7,100 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
