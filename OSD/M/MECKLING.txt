MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Clay County, South Dakota, 1995.  The name is from a small town in Clay County.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 centimeters (Ap horizon);
aquic feature--redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less above a depth of 1 meter;
udic moisture regime.

It is believed that a frequently saturated zone was within depths of 0 to 0.3 meters when these soils formed.

Meckling soil was formerly mapped as Fluvaquents and Riverwash or included with Sarpy soils in previous surveys.
