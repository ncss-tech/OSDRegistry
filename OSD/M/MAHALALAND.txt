MAHALALAND SERIES

The Mahalaland series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mahalaland soils formed in loess or other silty material and the underlying loamy outwash. They are on outwash plains and outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cald, Cyclone, Gabriel, Luray, Mahalasville, Ragsdale, and Treaty series. Cald, Cyclone, Luray, Mahalasville, Ragsdale, and Treaty soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Gabriel soils have a mollic epipedon that is thicker than 53 cm (21 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mahalaland soils are on outwash plains and outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash. They are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 165 to 180 days. Elevation is 152 to 244 meters (500 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowes, Lafayette, Proctor, Rush, Totanang, Waupecan, and Waynetown soils. The well drained Bowes, Proctor, Rush, and Waupecan soils and the moderately well drained Totanang soils are on higher landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Lafayette and Waynetown soils have redox depletions in the upper part of the profile and are on slightly lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. In drained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during the winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and high in the lower part, and high or very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately rapid in the lower part, and rapid or very rapid in the underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are cultivated. Alfalfa, clover, corn, soybeans, and wheat are the principal crops. Native vegetation is forest of ash, elm, and maple, with areas of swamp grasses prominent in many places.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111D in west-central Indiana. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Tippecanoe County, Indiana, 1998.

REMARKS: These soils were mapped as Mahalasville gravelly substratum soils in Tippecanoe and Montgomery Counties, and as Westland soils in Fountain County. Transects indicate that these soils should be separated from the Westland and Mahalasville soils based on the thickness of the silty material and the underlying gravelly outwash.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 117 cm (Btg, 2Btg horizons.
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features in all horizons below the mollic epipedon. 

Representative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153351 in MO 11.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Transect data is on file at the MLRA Soil Survey Office in Indianapolis.
