MILKIWAY SERIES

The Milkiway series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Milkiway soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Buncelvoir, Farmell, Lanktree, and Schamp soils do not have redox concentrations or endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface.  Diaz, Glasgow, Oppio, and Trunk soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Risley soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Milkiway soils are on stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks but with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dangberg, Gardnerville, Godecke, Ormsby, and Turria soils.  Dangberg soils have natric horizons and are moderately deep to duripans.  Gardnerville soils have albic horizons, natric horizons, and horizons with durinodes within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Godecke soils are fine-loamy and have natric horizons.  Ormsby soils are sandy, have horizons with a firm and brittle matrix, and do not have argillic horizons.  Turria soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high surface runoff; moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between 122 and 152 cm (deep internal free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Milkiway soils are used for irrigated cropland.  Common crops are alfalfa hay, small grains, and grass-legume hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
