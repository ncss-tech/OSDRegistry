MUKLUNG SERIES

The Muklung series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over loess on rises and talfs of plains. Slopes range from 0 to 16 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 635 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over loamy, amorphic over isotic Andic Haplocryods

TYPICAL PEDON: Muklung highly organic silt loam, located on a plain rise with a slope of 15 percent and elevation of 19 meters; when described on September 15th, 2007 the soil was moist to 157 and saturated from 157 to 183 cm (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oe--0 to 2 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, common medium roots, and common coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.7); clear smooth boundary

 E--2 to 6 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) highly organic silt loam; 20 percent sand; 72 percent silt; 8 percent clay; weak medium granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots and common medium roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.7); clear smooth boundary

 Bhs--6 to 10 cm; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) medial highly organic silt loam; 20 percent sand; 72 percent silt; 8 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots and common medium roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary

 BC1--10 to 85 cm; dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) medial silt; 12 percent sand; 82 percent silt; 6 percent clay; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots and common medium roots; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual smooth boundary

 BC2--85 to 95 cm; 50 percent brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; 18 percent sand; 76 percent silt; 6 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 20 percent medium dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) masses of reduced iron with clear boundaries and 30 percent medium strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron with sharp boundaries; moderately acid (pH 5.7)
