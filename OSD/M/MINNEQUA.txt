MINNEQUA SERIES 

The Minnequa series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum weathered from chalk, marl, limestone, and limy sedimentary bedrock.  Minnequa soils are on hills, cuestas, plains, interfluves, pediments, and ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.) 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Arkansas Valley Area, Colorado, 1926. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (A horizon)
Calcic horizon: the zone from 43 to 89 cm (17 to 35 inches).
Paralithic contact: soft chalk and marl at 89 centimeters (35 inches) (Cr horizon)
Moisture regime: aridic bordering on ustic. 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomic Version: Eleventh Edition, 2010.

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

LAN 1/16/2013 The previous classification of calcareous Ustic Torriorthents became obsolete with the Eleventh Edition to Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  Based on a field project this update moves the type location from Prowers County to Pueblo County, Colorado and changes the Taxonomic class to Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids.
