MINALOOSA SERIES

The Minaloosa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary rock. Minaloosa soils are on hills and uplands and have slopes of 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are on hills and uplands and have slopes of 15 to 60 percent. Elevation is 2,680 to 3,720 feet (817 to 1134 meters). The soils formed in loess mixed with residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary rock. The mean annual precipitation is 26 to 44 inches (584 to 750 mm). The frost-free period ranges from 95 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arson soils.  Arson soils are deep to a paralithic contact and are on side slopes, shoulders and ridge summits of foothills and low mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production. The natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, oceanspray, redstem ceanothus, chokeberry, mallow ninebark, and serviceberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Latah County, Idaho. The series is of small extent.  MLRA 43A.

The 8/2009 description reflects an update in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Dystroxerepts to Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts.  C1 horizon from 34 to 27 inches changed to BC horizon.  Changes made based on updated mapping in Latah County and on a description completed at the original Minaloosa type location in 2008.
