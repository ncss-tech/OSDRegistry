MCDAVITT SERIES

The McDavitt series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy over clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are in concave positions on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over clayey, mixed over smectitic, superactive, nonacid, frigid Typic Endoaquepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: McDavitt mucky peat, on a slope of 0 percent, on a glacial lake plain, in a field, at an elevation of about 400 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    0e--0 to 5 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) mucky peat, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; massive; very friable; many very fine to medium roots; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 18 centimeters thick)

    A--5 to 18 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) mucky silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate very fine to medium granular structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 centimeters thick)

    Eg--18 to 38 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) loamy very fine sand, light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt broken boundary. (0 to 20 centimeters thick)

    Bg1--38 to 56 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) stratified silt loam and loam; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bg2--56 to 76 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) stratified very fine sandy loam and loamy very fine sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many medium distinct gray (2.5Y 5/1) redoximorphic depletions and many medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; abrupt broken boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 25 to 56 centimeters)

    2Cg1--76 to 114 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; massive; firm; many medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

    2Cg2--114 to 203 centimeters; dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) silty clay; massive; firm; many medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material-loamy over clayey glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform-concave positions on glacial lake plains
Slope-0 to 1 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature-3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711
Frost free period--95 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Zimm and Aerie soils. These soils formed in the same parent material as the McDavitt soils and form a hydrosequence with the McDavitt soils.
Zimm--are on adjacent flat landscape positions
Aerie--are on convex positions on the landscape above the Zimm and McDavitt soils

 
DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--very poorly drained-a frequently saturated zone occurs at the surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--4.23 to 141.14 micrometers per second in the loamy mantle and 0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second in the clayey glaciolacustrine deposits
The McDavitt soils have ponding above the surface in the spring and fall of most years.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are dominately forested. Some areas are cleared and used for hay or pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland Province or Superior Upland
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR--K; northern Minnesota
Extent--small
