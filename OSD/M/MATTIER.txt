MATTIER SERIES

The Mattier series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from welded tuff. The Mattier soils are on mountain backslopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Mattier very gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones. Lithology of the fragments is welded tuff.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Mattier soils are on backslopes of mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from welded tuff. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,440 to 3,050 meters. The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the McIvey, Notellumcreek, and Tusel series. McIvey soils are very deep to bedrock. Notellumcreek soils are shallow to bedrock. Tusel soils have mollic epipedons that are 40 to 56 cm thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mattier soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly, bluebunch wheatgrass, mutton grass, and low sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28B.
