MEDWAY SERIES

The Medway series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TYPE LOCATION: Pickaway County, Ohio; about 7 miles southeast of Circleville, in Pickaway Township; 2885 feet south and 50 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 12, T. 10 N., R. 21 W.; USGS Stoutsville, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 32 minutes and 21 seconds N. and long. 82 degrees 50 minutes and 44 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches)
Depth to the base of the cambic horizon: 71 to 152 cm (28 to 60 inches)

Bedrock substratum phase:
Depth to limestone bedrock: 152 to 305 cm (60 to 120 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Harrod and Shaffton series. Harrod soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Shaffton soils are more acid than slightly acid in the cambic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Medway soils are on flood plains of both major and minor streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium washed from soils formed in drift of Wisconsinan age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 600 to 1100 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eel, Genesee, Ross, Rossburg, Shoals, and Sloan soils. The moderately well drained Eel, well drained Genesee, and somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils are members of a toposequence that do not have a mollic epipedon. Eel soils are on similar landscape positions. The well drained Ross and Rossburg soils commonly are on higher landscape positions or are nearer to stream channels. The somewhat poorly drained Shoals and the very poorly drained Sloan soils typically are on lower landscape positions or are farther from stream channels.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum. Unless protected, Medway soils are subject to flooding. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are under cultivation. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Some areas are in permanent pasture or woodland. Sycamore, ash, elm, oak, beech, maple, and walnut are the principal woodland tree species. Native vegetation is scattered deciduous forest with prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 99, 111A, 111B, 111E, and 121 in western and central Ohio; MLRAs 111A in central Indiana and MLRA 115A in southwest Indiana; MLRAs 108A, 108B, 113, 114B, 115B, and 115C in central and western Illinois; and MLRA 115B in Missouri. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent.
