MOODY SERIES

The Moody series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  Moody soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 17 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Udic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Moody silty clay loam, on a northwest-facing facing, convex, 2 percent slope in a cultivated field  (When described the soil was moist to 35 inches and dry below.  Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Ap--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

	Bw1--10 to 17 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine pores; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

	Bw2--17 to 29 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam,  weak medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, common 10YR 3/3 coatings on faces of peds; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine pores; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

	Bw3--29 to 35 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium and coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine pores; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (Combined Bw horizons is 15 to 35 inches thick.)

	Bk--35 to 48 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations and gray (5Y 6/1) redox depletions; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; common fine and medium accumulations of calcium carbonate; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 20 inches thick)

	C--48 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silt loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; few fine prominent gray (5Y 6/1) redox depletions, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and very dark brown (10YR 2/2) redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, friable; few fine accumulations of calcium carbonate; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Egan and Splitrock soils have glacial till at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Ihlen soils have a lithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Nora soils have free calcium carbonates between depths of 13 and 30 inches.  Splitrock soils do have loam or clay loam substrata within depths of 40 inches.  Wentworth soils typically have more than 3 percent fine or coarser sand in the series control section and have stratified substrata.
