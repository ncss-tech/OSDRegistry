REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches, Ap and BA horizons).
Argillic horizon - the zone from 30 to 132 cm (12 to 52 inches, Bt and Btx horizons).

The Monongahela series became the official State Soil of West Virginia by an act of the West Virginia Legislature in 1997. 
The 2007 revision corrects the coordinates of the Type Location and updates the Competing Series section.
