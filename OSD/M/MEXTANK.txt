MEXTANK SERIES

The Mextank series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  These soils formed in limestone and sandstone colluvium and alluvium.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.

Soil Temperature:  54 to 56 degrees F.

Thickness of mollic epipedon: 10 to 20 inches

Depth to calcic horizon: 1 to 20 inches

Clay content: ranges from 12 to 22 percent, averages less than 18 percent in the control section

Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent in the control section.  Below the control section, rock fragments may range up to 75 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ayon (NM), Curabith (CO), Hogadero (NM), Hubert (AZ), Modyon (NM), and Pena (NM) series.  Ayon soils averages more than 18 percent clay and is dominated by stone and cobble. Curabith soils have mean annual soil temperature of 49 to 52 degrees F., and have mollic surface layers of 7 to 10 inches. Hogadero soils have strongly cemented calcic horizons. Modyon soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Hubert and Pena soils do not have lithologic discontinuities in the lower pedon containing stratified materials.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mextank soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces at elevations of 5000 to 6500 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from sandstone and limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The frost-free period is 135 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lykorly and Disterheff series.  Lykorly soils are fine-loamy and Disterheff series are fine textured.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mextank soils are used for fuelwood production, grazeable woodland, and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is Utah juniper, Colorado pinyon, bottle brush squirreltail, blue grama, muttongrass, turbinella oak, Wyoming big sagebrush, and Wright birdbeak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  This series is not extensive.  MLRA is 38 and 39.
