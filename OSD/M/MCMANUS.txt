MCMANUS SERIES 

The Mcmanus series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County, Montana, 1997. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1479.  Diagnostic  horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 14 inches (A1, A2 horizons); accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate from 14 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, Bk4 horizons); particle- size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A2, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons).  Mcmanus soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aquic.
