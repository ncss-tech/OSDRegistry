MARTHASPEAK SERIES

The Marthaspeak series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone.  Marthaspeak soils are on mesas and cuestas.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Aridic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Marthaspeak loamy fine sand, on a southeast facing, convex, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 6720 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on April 14, 1994 the soil was moist from 0 to 25 inches.

  A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; very few fine vesicular and tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

  C1--3 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; very few fine vesicular and tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (total thickness of the C horizon is 18 to 38 inches thick)

  C2--25 to 33 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; very few fine vesicular and tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. 

  R--33 inches; hard sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dearjosh, Trey, Tusler, Yetull, and Zeona series.
Dearjosh, Yetull, and Zeona soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock.
Trey and Tusler soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marthaspeak soils.
Parent material: residuum derived from sandstone.
Landform: mesas and cuestas.
Slopes: 1 to 45 percent
Elevation: 6,200 to 7,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 42 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 14 inches.
  Wettest months: Precipitation is relatively evenly
  distributed throughout the year.
Frost-free period: 70 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dearjosh, Emlin, Mantlemine, and Lakebench series.  
Dearjosh, Emlin, Mantlemine, and Lakebench soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat excessively drained, low runoff, rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native plant community is needleandthread, Nevada bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, Wyoming sagebrush, Utah juniper, and pinyon pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.
