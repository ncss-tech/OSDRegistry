COMPETING SERIES: These are the Islamorada and  Shark Valley series, and the Tamiami series in a closely related family.. 
Islamorada soils--lack stratification of marly sediments, are in the tidal zone. are very frequently flooded, and occur in marine marshes, swamps, or low broad flats.
Shark Valley soils--have bedrock at depths less than 101 centimeters (40 inches) and occur on similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils--have bedrock at depths less than 101 centimeters (40 inches), are stratified with calcareous silty marl, and hyperthermic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Florida Everglades
Landform(s): Talfs, rises, and/or dips in fresh water marshes and swamps 
Parent material: organic materials formed from remains of hydrophytic herbaceous plant overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean annual air temperature: 24 to 26 degrees C (75 to 79 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 112 to 160 centimeters (44 to 63 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Shark Valley soils, these are:
Buffalo Tiger soils--lack limestone bedrock within 203 centimeters (80 inches) and occur in similar landform positions.
Coopertown soils--have limestone bedrock within 20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Gator Lake soils--have limestone bedrock within 5 to 18 centimeters (2 to 7 inches) of the surface and occur in similar landform positions.
Loxahatche soils--are very deep, lack limestone substratum within 203 centimeters (80 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Plantation soils--have sandy layers below the organic layer and above the limestone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): Very high to high
Permeability: Rapid 
Surface runoff: Negligible
Flooding frequency and duration: None
Ponding frequency and duration: Under natural conditions the soil is covered by water (ponded) - very frequently for very long duration 9 to 11 months, currently ponding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Dominant vegetation: sawgrass, sedges, lilies, spikerush, willow, elderberry, pond apple, and cypress. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Florida Everglades and associated areas.  This soil is of moderate extent
