COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cooper Town (FL), Shark Valley (FL), and Tamiami (FL) soils. 
Cooper Town soils have limestone at depths of 20 to 50 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) and occur in similar landform positions.
Shark Valley soils have limestone at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and occur on similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils have subsurface horizons of freshwater marl that compose less than 1/2 the thickness of the control section and occur in similar landform positions.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Florida Everglades and Lower Coastal Plain
Landform: Talfs, rises, and/or dips in freshwater marshes and swamps of the Everglades and depressions on flatwoods areas.  
Parent material: well decomposed organic materials overlying limestone bedrock. 
Mean annual air temperature: 25 to 27 degrees C. (77 to 81 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 1118 to 1651 millimeters (44 to 65 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Buffalo Tiger soils have limestone at depths of 150 to 203 centimeters (60 to 80 inches) and occur in similar landform positions.
Gator Lake soils have limestone within 18 centimeters (7 inches) and occur in similar landform positions.
Loxahatche soils lack limestone within 203 centimeters (80 inches) of the soil surface and are in similar landform positions.
Plantation soils have sandy layers more than 25 centimeters (10 inches) thick below the organic layer and above the limestone, and they occur on similar landform positions.
Shark Valley soils have limestone at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Tamiami soils have subsurface horizons of freshwater marl that compose less than 1/2 the thickness of the control section and occur in similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Moderately high to high

Surface runoff: Negligible
Flooding frequency and duration: Sawgrass plains are very frequently flooded for very long periods, during the dry season or periods of drought there may be no flooding. In natural conditions, flooding occurs for very long duration of 9 to 11 months. Tree Islands are occasionally flooded for brief periods during periods of heavy rainfall, severe storms, and hurricanes. Currently flooding is controlled by anthropogenic activities.
Ponding frequency and duration: depressions on flatwoods areas are covered by water (ponded) very frequently for very long duration 9 to 11 months.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Water quality, water storage, and wildlife habitat. 
Dominant vegetation: sawgrass, sedges, lilies, spikerush, willow, elderberry, pond apple, and cypress. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 156A Florida Everglades and Associated Areas.  This soil is of moderate extent.
