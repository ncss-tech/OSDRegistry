MERRICK SERIES

The Merrick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils.  Merrick soils formed in stratified silty and loamy alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains in river valleys in the Central Nebraska Loess Hills, MLRA 71. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 635 millimeters (25 inches) at the type location.

Flooding: occasional to rarely

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soil is used principally as irrigated cropland.   Corn, grain sorghum, and alfalfa are the most commonly grown crops.  The native vegetation, for the small acreage used for range and hayland, consists mainly of big bluestem, switchgrass, and indiangrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Merrick series occurs in west central and eastern Nebraska and Kansas.  LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 71 Central Nebraska Loess Hills, MLRA 72 Central High Tableland, MLRA 74 Central Kansas Sandstone Hills and MLRA 75 Central Loess Plains.  The soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Merrick County, Nebraska, 1978.

REMARKS:   
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 76 centimeters (30 inches) (Ap, A1, A2 horizons)

Merrick soils were mapped as Waukesha loam and as Lamoure very fine sandy loam on older surveys.

11/2011 JGA
Added metric conversions.  Lowered bottom depth of depth to redox concentrations from 97 centimeters to 125 centimeters to fit type location.  Lowered particle size control section clay content to 20 percent from 27 percent to fit the type location textures and what has been populated in NASIS. Added clay and sand percentages to range of characteristics horizon data.  Updated competing series and geographically associated soils. Expanded the range of Frost Free Days from 150 to 180 days, Mean Annual Precipitation from 710 millimeters to 750 millimeters, Mean Annual Air Temperature from 11 degrees C to 12 degrees C, and Elevation from 610 meters to 450 meters. Added saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Added occasional to flooding frequency.
