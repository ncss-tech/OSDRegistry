SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Office

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Kleberg County, Texas, 2007

REMARKS:
The name is from Laguna Madre, which is between Padre Island and the mainland of south Texas. The series was formerly included in the Mustang series and are separated based on the difference in the sodium adsorption ratio of the soils.

Typical pedon taxonomic features:
Aquic conditions: 28 to 200 centimeters
Endosaturation: 28 to 200 centimeters (Cng, Anb, and Cngb horizons)
Redox concentrations: 0 to 200 centimeters
Redox depletions or depleted matrix: 28 to 200 centimeters (Cng, Anb, and Cngb horizons)
Sodic features (SAR more than 13): 0 to 200
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 28 centimeters (An horizons)
Taxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th edition (2022)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Particle-size analysis on five pedons and salinity and sodicity tests on six pedons performed at the soil survey project office.
