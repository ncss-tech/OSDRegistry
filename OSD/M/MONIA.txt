MONIA SERIES

The Monia series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous, sandy and loamy eolian deposits of Holocene age. Monia soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and interdunes with slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C ( 54 degrees F).

Landform: nearly level to gently sloping plains and interdunes.
Slopes: 0 to 5 percent.
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is typically uniform throughout most of the year with rainfall the highest from April through October. Average snowfall is about 18 inches annually from November through April.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Corlena, Dallam, Karde, Nara, Perico, Rickmore, Spurlock, Valerian, Vingo, and Visa series.
Dallam, Perico, and Rickmore soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains have a fine-loamy particle size control section.
Corlena soils are on narrow floodplains of draws have a fine-silty particle-size class.
Karde soils are on playa dunes and have carbonatic minerology. 
Nara and Visa soils: are on interdunes and dunes and have argillic horizons and do not have a calcic horizon.
Spurlock soils are on similar landscape positions and have argillic horizons and carbonatic mineralogy.
Valerian soils: are on dunes and have a sandy particle size class.
Vingo soils are on similar landscape positions and have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained and moderately permeable. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 15 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for livestock grazing. Climax vegetation is a Tall/Midgrass community. The major tallgrass species are sand bluestem and little bluestem. The midgrasses are sideoats grama, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, blue grama, and dropseed, and perennial threeawns. Woody shrubs consist of yucca, skunkbush sumac, and sand sage, and the occasional sand plum thickets. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077BY658TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B, 12-17" PZ.
