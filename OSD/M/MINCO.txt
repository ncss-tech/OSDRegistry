MINCO SERIES

The Minco series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in material weathered from loamy eolian deposits of Pleistocene age. These soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 864 millimeters (34 in). Mean annual air temperature is 16.6 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Udic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Minco silt loam--cultivated. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); brown (7.5YR 4/2) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 

   A--18 to 38 cm (7 to 15 in); brown (7.5YR 4/3) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 0 to 40 cm [0 to 16 in])

   Bw1--38 to 61 cm (15 to 24 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silt loam; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable; common fine roots; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

   Bw2--61 to 97 cm (24 to 38 in); light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) silt loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable; common fine roots; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

   Bw3--97 to 140 cm (38 to 55 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) silt loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 20 to 100 cm [8 to 51 in]) 

   Ck--140 to 183 cm (55 to 72 in); red (2.5YR 5/8) silt loam, red (2.5YR 4/8) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; few films of secondary carbonates; calcareous; moderately alkaline.
