MATCHWOOD SERIES

The Matchwood series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey till overlying loamy till on till plain landscapes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow in the clayey till and moderate or moderately slow in the loamy till. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage  a zone of seasonal water saturation occurs from 15 centimeters above the surface to 15 centimeters below the surface from March to June and in October and November (poorly drained).
