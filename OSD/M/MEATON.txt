Edgerly and Jeanerette soils: are wetter; superactive cation exchange capacity to clay class
Labelle soils: in a fine family; are drier
Morey soils: are drier; in a superactive cation exchange capacity to clay class

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age
Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: flats
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.0 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months.

Elevation: 1 to 5 m (3 to 16 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aris, Anahuac, Labelle, Levac, Orcadia, Morey and the Spindletop series. 

Aris soils: are gray throughout due to wetness; are on flats
Anahuac and Orcadia soils: are on a broader landform
Labelle soils: have subsoils with more clay content; on flats
Levac soils: somewhat poorly drained; are truncated pimple mounds 
Morey soils: are higher in elevation; not subject to storm surge
Spindletop soils: are in a fine family; are on pimple mounds 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is high. Rarely flooded for very brief to brief periods. Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils have endosaturation from 40 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) below the surface from January to March in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for pasture or rice production.  Some areas are used for rangeland.  Native grasses include species of andropogon, paspalum, and panicum

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas generally east of the Trinity River, Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A; the series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Texas; 1996

REMARKS:  The Meaton soils were formerly included with the Morey series. The series type location was moved during the update of MLRA 150A to a location with lab data. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 50 to 90 cm (16 to 36 in). (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon) 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 40 cm (0 to 16 in). (Ap and A horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 40 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in). (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4 horizons)
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation at 72 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in). (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 horizons)

Additional Comments: Data on sampled pedons indicate a mixed mineralogy and active CEC to clay class.

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data from type location on pedon S12TX2451004. Additional data on pedons S10TX0712760, S12TX2451003, and S12TX2451000. Pedon S12TX2451000 is a taxadjunct to the series.
