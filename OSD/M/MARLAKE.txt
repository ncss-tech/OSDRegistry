MARLAKE SERIES 

The Marlake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. They are in depressions on interdunes of sandhills and are ponded with water most of the growing season. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 centimeters (19 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Mollic Psammaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Marlake mucky peat on a concave slope of less than 1 percent with marsh vegetation. When described the soil was moist to 9 inches and wet below. (Colors are for moist soil unless other wise stated.) 

	Oe--0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches): very dark brown (10YR2/2) mucky peat, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; neutral; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) thick]

[15 to 23 centimeters (6 to 9 inches) thick] 

	ACg--23 to 41 centimeters (9 to 16 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loamy fine sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; stratified with olive gray (5Y 5/2) sand, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) dry; common medium distinct olive (5Y 4/4) moist and light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) moist iron masses in the matrix; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; common fine and very fine roots throughout; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 38 centimeters (0 to 15 inches) thick] 

	Cg--41 to 200 centimeters (16 to 79 inches); gray (5Y 6/1) sand, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; many fine faint olive (5Y 5/3) moist iron depletions in the matrix; single grain; loose; few fine and very fine roots throughout matrix above 91 centimeters (36 inches); neutral.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Glendora, Kanza, Kingsville, Pay, Plev, Tobico, and Vestaburg series. 
All of these soils are saturated to the surface for shorter periods during the growing season. 
Glendora soils have a higher mean annual precipitation and are on frequently flooded flood plains.
Kanza soils have a higher mean annual air temperature and are on floodplains. 
Kingsville soils have a higher mean annual precipitation, typically contain up to 10 percent rock fragments in the substratum having formed in glaciolacustrine sediments. 
Pay soils typically contain up to 15 percent rock fragments in the substratum having formed in alluvium from igneous rocks and are on occasionally flooded floodplains.
Plev soils have a higher mean annual temperature and are on paleo-terraces in river valleys.
Tobico soils have a higher mean annual precipitation and typically contain up to 25 percent rock fragments in the substratum having formed in sandy materials on outwash plains and lake benches
Vestaburg soils have a higher mean annual precipitation and contain 10 to 50 percent rock fragments in the substratum having formed in sandy deposits on outwash plains and outwash valley trains. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: sandy eolian deposits
Landscape: sandhills
Landform: depression on interdune
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Elevation: 610 to 1066 meters (2000 to 3500 feet)

Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C. (46 to 50 degrees F.) 
Frost Free Days: 120 to 150

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Els, Ipage, Tryon, and Valentine soils. 
Els soils are higher on swales on interdunes and are somewhat poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 46 centimeters (18 inches). 
Ipage soils are higher on swales and hummocks on interdunes, lack mollic epipedons, and are moderately well drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at 91 centimeters (36 inches).
Tryon soils are slightly higher on swales on interdunes and are poorly and very poorly drained having a seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions beginning at the surface. 
Valentine soils are on higher hummocks and dunes and are excessively drained having no seasonal zone of saturation or aquic conditions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: very poorly
Runoff: negligible
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: very high 
Ponding frequency: frequent
Ponding duration: very long with a depth of up to 61centimeters (24 inches)            

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mostly as habitat for wildlife and grazing. Vegetation consists mainly of sedges, rushes, cattails, reeds, and other aquatic plants. Grasses such as prairie cordgrass, common reedgrass, and reedcanary grass are common on the outer margins. No ecological site is assigned.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Nearly all in and near the Sandhills of Nebraska and South Dakota (LRR G, MLRA 65). The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Keya Paha County, Nebraska, 1977. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Aquic soil conditions: 23 to 200 centimeters (9 to 79 inches) (ACg and Cg horizons) 
The Marlake series were classified as a miscellaneous land type (Marsh) in older surveys. Strata and buried layers are from wind deposition or organic accumulation representing drought and wet climatic periods of time rather than recent flooding.
