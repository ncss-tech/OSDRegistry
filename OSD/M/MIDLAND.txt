MIDLAND SERIES

The Midland series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in loamy and clayey sediments of late Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils occur on low concave terraces above stream channels on coast plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1574 mm (62 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Vertic Epiaqualfs

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Tensas (LA) series in the same family and the similar Bacliff (TX), Baldwin (LA), Beaumont (TX), Crowley (LA), Edna (TX), Judice (LA), Kaplan (LA), Mowata (LA), and Viterbo (TX) series.  
Tensas soils: somewhat poorly drained; formed in Holocene age natural levee sediments; are underlain with loamy materials.  
Bacliff, Beaumont, and Judice soils are Vertisols; Judice soils have a mollic epipedon.
Baldwin soils: formed in Holocene age Mississippi River delta sediments; are on slightly better drained convex positions on natural leeves.  
Crowley and Edna soils: have an abrupt textural change.  
Kaplan soils: have sub-horizons with chroma of more than 2.  
Mowata soils: have a glossic horizon.
Viterbo soils: have red masses of iron accumulation in the B horizons; are somewhat poorly drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy and clayey alluvial sediments of late Pleistocene age; presumed to have been deposited mainly by the Red River with some influence from the Mississippi River
Landscape: coastal plains river valleys 
Landform: terraces
Microfeature: open depressions
Slope: 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent.
Mean annual precipitation: 1397 to 1651 mm (55 to 65 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is uniform throughout the year with slight peaks during the spring and summer months
Mean annual air temperature: 19.3 to 20.1 degrees C (67 to 68 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 235 to 350 days
Elevation: 1.5 to 21.3 m (5 to 70 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basile (LA), Crowley (LA), Judice (LA), Kaplan (LA), and Mowata (LA) soils.  
Basile soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section; a glossic horizon; on flood plains of drainageways. Crowley and Kaplan soils: somewhat poorly drained; on convex ridges and sideslopes at slightly higher elevations.  
Judice and Mowata soils: are in similar positions.  Judice soils have a mollic epipedon.  Mowata soils have a glossic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Very slow permeability.  Runoff is high. A water table exists from 6 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 ft) from the soil surface from November through April in normal years. Some areas are subject to occasional or rare flooding for brief periods.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is cultivated and used to grow rice and soybeans, rotated with pasture or used for crayfish aquaculture.  A few areas are used for corn, grain sorghum, and wheat.  Native vegetation was tall prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Louisiana; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A-Gulf Coast Prairies; the series is of large extent.
