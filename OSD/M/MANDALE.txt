SERIES ESTABLISHED: Alamance County, North Carolina; 2009.

REMARKS: Mandale soils were previously mapped as Orange soils in the 1960 Alamance County Soil Survey Report and were formerly included with the Secrest and Lignum soils in more recent soil mapping of nearby counties. Mandale soils with hue of 10YR in the upper Bt horizon have a positive reaction with alpha, alpha-dipyridyl when saturated.

Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (18 centimeters) (A and BE horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 55 inches (18 to 140 centimeters) (Bt and BCtg horizons)
Aquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction within 7 to 55 inches (18 to 140) centimeters of the soil surface, and one or more unsaturated layers within 80 inches (200 centimeters) of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone (episaturation)
Redox concentrations--the zone from 2 to 64 inches (5 to 163 centimeters) (BE, Bt, BCtg, and C horizons)
Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less--the zone from 16 to 54 inches (41 to 163 centimeters) (Bt, BCtg, and C horizons)
Paralithic contact--soft bedrock contact at a depth of 64 inches (163 centimeters) (upper boundary of the Cr layer)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 64 to 77 inches (163 to 196 centimeters) (Cr horizon)
