MILNICHOL SERIES

The Milnichol series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains and outwash plains. These soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine sediments overlying loamy lacustrine deposits. Slope range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C. (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Epiaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Milnichol fine sand, on a 1 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of 243 meters (798 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Bs2--64 to 84 cm (25 to 33 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) fine sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; common medium faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 1 percent gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 30 to 76 cm (12 to 30 inches).]

 C1--84 to 119 cm (33 to 47 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; many coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 1 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [0 to 46 cm (18 inches) thick]

 2C3--127 to 173 cm (50 to 68 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/3) silty clay loam; massive; firm; many medium distinct gray (7.5YR 6/1) iron depletions; many medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary

 2C4--173 to 203 cm (68 to 80 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam; massive; friable; many coarse distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Milnichol soils are on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits overlying loamy lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Thompsonville, Pipestone, Dair, and Nessen soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Dair soils are in depressions and along drainageways. The Pipestone soils are on similar positions but do not have the loamy substratum. The moderately well drained Thompsonville soils are on similar or slightly higher landscape positions. The excessively drained Nessen soils are on higher locations and do not have the loamy substratum.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 inches) between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high over moderately low. Permeability is rapid over slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are forested. Common trees are red pine, eastern white pine, paper birch and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
