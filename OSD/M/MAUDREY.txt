MAUDREY SERIES

The Maudrey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from Dakota sandstone.  Maudrey soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maudrey loam, on a southeast facing, simple, 3 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 8720 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). Described on September 10, 1985.

     A1--0 to 4 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine continuous pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.

(0 to 10 inches thick)

     Bt1--31 to 41 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many very fine continuous pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear wavy boundary.

     Bt2--41 to 54 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine continuous pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 14 to 30 inches)

      C--54 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; very hard; very firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine continuous pores; 14 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Kinesava series. A former competitor is the Maughan series which now is a Palexerolls.
Kinesava soils: have neutral to moderately alkaline reaction throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from Dakota sandstone.
Landform:  mesas.
Slopes:  1 to 15 percent
Elevation: 8,200 to 8,900 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 42 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  20 to 25 inches.
  Wettest months:  July and August receive slightly more precipitation than other months.
  Driest months: May and June receive the least precipitation, however the soils are still moist from snowmelt.
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Behanco, Fughes, and Tombac soils.  
Behanco soils have a cryic temperature regime and are on mesas at higher elevations.
Fughes soils have the top of the argillic horizon above 24 inches and are in drainageways and on hills. 
Tombac soils do not have the thick mollic epipedon and are on mesas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part of the profile and slow permeability in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gamble's oak, mountain snowberry, quaking aspen, serviceberry, Parry's danthonia, bluegrass, bromegrass, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  The series is of small extent.
