GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the similar Estacado and Posey soils and also the Berda, Bippus, Olton, Posey, Potter and Pullman series. 
Berda soils: occur on lower landscape positions, do not have an argillic horizon and have mixed mineralogy. 
Bippus soils: occur on lower landscape positions, have much fewer carbonates and have mixed mineralogy. 
Estacado and Posey soils: occur on similar landscape positions. 
Olton, and Pullman soils: occur on higher landscape positions and have mixed mineralogy. 
Potter soils: occur on lower landscapes positions and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability; surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Primarily used for rangeland. Where cultivated, the principal crops are grain sorghum, small grains, and forage crops. Climax vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the Limy Upland (R077CY028TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma in the Southern High Plains (MLRA 77C in LRR H). The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harding County, Mesa Soil Conservation District, New Mexico; 1939. 

REMARKS: Series Revised MLRA-77 Soil Survey update in Floyd County, Texas; 2004. After review of the lab data, the taxonomic family particle-size class was changed from fine-loamy to coarse-loamy in 2008. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) (Btkk, Btk horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in) (Bkk, Btkk, Btk horizons) 
Plugged (kk) horizon: 20 to 71 cm (8 to 28 in) (Bkk, Btkk horizons) 
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data from Floyd County, TX (S99TX-153-003 and S1999TX153001).
