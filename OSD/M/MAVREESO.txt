MAVREESO SERIES

The Mavreeso series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium, and alluvium derived from red sedimentary rocks. Mavreeso soils are on fan remnants, canyon sideslopes, and mountain slopes.   Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Entic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mavreeso loam, on a south facing, simple, 22 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland at an elevation of 7,920 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk3--50 to 60 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium roots; common very fine and few medium pores; few fine soft filaments of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
