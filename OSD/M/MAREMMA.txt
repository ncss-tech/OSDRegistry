 A2--8 to 15 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary

 Bt--15 to 61 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); abrupt wavy boundary
