MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Duval County, Florida; 1977.

REMARKS: Mandarin soils were formerly mapped as a thermic variant of the Cassia series. Based on a 2-year soil temperature study, the mean annual soil temperature range for this soil in Duval County, Florida is about 69.2 to 71.5 degrees F. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon)
Albic horizon--the zone from 4 to 26 inches (E horizon)
Spodic horizon--the zone from 30 to 40 inches and 73 to 80 or more inches (Bh2, Bh3 and Bh horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within 18 to 42 inches of the surface, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
