MARKLEY SERIES

The Markley series consists of very deep to claystone bedrock, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey slope alluvium derived from sandstone over clayey residuum weathered from claystone. These gently to moderately sloping soils occur on base slopes of ridges on hills. Slope range is 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 799 mm (31 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Young County, Texas, Stephenville MLRA Soil Survey Area, 2020. The name Markley is from a community in northern Young County, Texas and the name of a geological formation. 

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Weswind and Windthorst series. The Windthorst and Weswind series have an abrupt textural change at the top of the argillic horizon. The Markley soils represent a less developed soil forming on base slopes.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 27 to 77 cm (11 to 30 in)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 27 cm (0 to 11 in) (A horizons).
Argillic horizon: 27 to 203 cm (11 to 80 in) (Bt and BCt horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 27 to 203 cm (11 to 80 in) (Bt and BCt horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: at 170 cm (67 in) (2BCt horizon).

Additional Comments:
This soil has a gradual increase in clay content with depth or colors with less than a chroma of 6 in the lower part of the argillic horizon.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory samples 92TX503001 from Young County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA:
KSSL Data from type location 92TX503001. Particle-size analysis and pH tests were performed at the project office on 6 pedons.
