MILTONHILLS SERIES

The Miltonhills series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from acidic tuff. The Miltonhills soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.            

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Miltonhills fine sandy loam on a northeast-facing, 40 percent, linear slope, under blue oak and annual grasses and forbs at an elevation of 88 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on February 27, 2013, the soil was moist throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Miltonhills soils are on the backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from acidic tuff mainly associated with the Valley Springs Formation. Elevation is 60 to 650 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 885 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 240 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amador, Gillender, Jennylind , Laniger, Ospital , Pardee, Pentz, and Redding soils. Amador, Gillender, and Pentz are also on hills, typically with less relief but have a paralithic contact within 50 centimeters. Pentz has a mollic epipedon. Jennylind and Ospital form on erosion remnants, lack an umbric epipedon, and have a lithic contact within 50 cm. Pardee soils are found on terrace remnants and eroded fan remnants, have a lithic contact within 50 centimeters, and are loamy-skeletal. Redding soils form on fan remnants, have a duripan within 50 to 100 centimeters, and have an argillic horizon with 35 or more percent clay. Laniger soils occupy similar geomorphic positions but have andic soil properties and a lithic contact within 50 to 100 centimeters. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity throughout the profile.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is very low to moderately high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mainly used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is annual grasses and forbs interspaced with hardwood species such as blue oak and buckeye. Understory species include brome, Italian ryegrass, meadow barley, and wild oat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Foothills of California; MLRA 18. The series is not extensive.
