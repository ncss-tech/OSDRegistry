SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Auburn, Alabama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coast area of Florida.  This soil is of moderate extent. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lee County, Florida; 1982.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:

   1. Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)
   2. Anthropogenic features: 0 to 89 centimeters (0 to 36 inches) (^C horizon)   
   3. Buried soil:  89 to 203 centimeters (36 to 81 inches) (2Ab, 2Eb horizons)
   4. Aquic conditions: Endosaturation 46 to 107 centimeters (18 to 42 inches) 

These soils were formerly mapped as made land or Arents.

The water table will vary with the amount of fill material and artificial drainage within any mapped area. However, in most years it is at depths of 24 to 36 inches below the surface of the fill for 2 to 4 months.  It is at depths below 60 inches during extended dry periods.
