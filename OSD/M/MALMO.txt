MALMO SERIES

The Malmo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands. They formed in weathered glacial till. Slopes range from 2 to 11 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F. at the type location.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Armstrong, Clafork, Hoyleton, Mystic, Otoe, Pering, and Sunbury soils.  Clafork, Hoyleton, Mystic and Pering soils do not allow carbonates in the solum.  Otoe soils have less than 10 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Sunbury soils do not allow carbonates above 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: weathered glacial till
Landform:  uplands
Slopes: 2 to 11 percent
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 56 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 34 inches
Frost-free period: 160 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Burchard, Mayberry, Morrill, Wymore and Yutan series.  The Burchard, Mayberry, Morrill and Wymore soils have a mollic epipedon.  Burchard and Morrill soils have less clay in the particle size control section.
The Burchard, Mayberry, and Morrill soils are on similar landscapes as the Malmo soils.
Wymore and Yutan soils contain less sand having formed in loess, and are usually higher on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, Medium runoff, Very slow permeability.  A seasonal high water saturation zone is common at a depth of 1 to 3 feet in the spring.

USE AND VEGETATION: More than one-half of the areas of Malmo soils are cultivated.  The principle crops are introduced grasses, grain sorghum and winter wheat.  The remaining areas are in reseeded native grasses used for rangeland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Nebraska and possibly northeast Kansas; LRR M, MLRA 106; Moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Saunders county, Nebraska, 1992.  The name is from a community in Saunders County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 6 to 43 inches.  (All Bt horizons)
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 6 inches.  (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 6 to 43 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons)
Redoximorphic features: In the zone from 6 inches on down. (All B and C horizons)
Vertic features: The presence of more than 35 clay at 6 to 43 inches.  (Bt horizons)
Episaturation: The zone of saturation at 12 to 36 inches. (Bt horizons)

Remarks: These soils were previously mapped as Mayberry, severely eroded.  These soils are assumed to have originally classified as Aquic Argiudolls.  However, because of severe erosion, these soils no longer have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, the part of the soil containing the most clay is now at or near the surface.  These changes have a significant affect on the use and management of these soils.
