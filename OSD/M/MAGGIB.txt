MAGGIB SERIES

The Maggib series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial drift on valley walls, bedrock benches, and passes.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent on passes and bedrock benches, and 15 to 65 percent on valley walls.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Andic Haplocryods

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maggib stony medial fine sandy loam, on a valley wall landform with a NNW facing slope of 20 percent at 1950 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation.  When described on September 17, 2007 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Altapeak, Chilliwack (T), Index, Shoestring, Skippeak, and Thetis soils.  Altapeak soils are ashy-skeletal in the upper part of the particle-size control section and have a paralithic contact at 100 to 150 cm.  Chilliwack soils are very deep to bedrock.  Index soils are ashy-skeletal in the upper part of the particle-size control section and have a paralithic contact at 100 to 180 cm.  Shoestring soils are very deep to bedrock, have amorphic over mixed mineralogy, and are formed in multiple layers of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice, with parts of the spodic horizon containing 30 to 45 percent pumice.  Skippeak soils are very deep to bedrock and are ashy-skeletal in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Thetis soils are very deep to bedrock and are ashy-skeletal in the upper part of the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Maggib soils are on valley walls, bedrock benches, and passes at elevations of 1,100 to 2,000 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and glacial drift.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 1 to 6 degrees C. Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilliwack(T), Spickard (T), and Treen soils.  Treen soils are found on the same landforms, are shallow to a lithic contact, and lack spodic horizons. Spickard soils form on the same stable portions of valley walls, are very deep to bedrock, and lack spodic horizons.  Chilliwack soils are found on valley walls and bedrock benches and are very deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland, and wildlife habitat.  Potential natural vegetation consists of Pacific silver fir, mountain hemlock, and subalpine fir with an understory of pink mountain heather and Cascade huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  25 to 80 centimeters from the mineral surface
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters (Oe, Oa, E, and upper 9 centimeters of the Bs1 horizons)
Albic horizon: 5 to 9 centimeters (E horizon)
Spodic horizon: 9 to 64 centimeters (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons)
Andic soil properties:  5 to 64 centimeters (E, Bs1, and Bs2 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity:  64 centimeters
Lithic contact: 80 centimeters

When chroma of the spodic horizon is 6, it still meets spodic material criteria 2.b.(3) (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Version 10, page 20).  Laboratory data from the geographically associated Chilliwack series (lab pedon number 06N0802) indicate that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum + 1/2 iron in the Bs (spodic) horizon is greater than 1.0 percent, and the overlying albic horizon is less than 0.2 percent.
