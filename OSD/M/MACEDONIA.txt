MACEDONIA SERIES

The Macedonia series consists of very deep, well drained soils on ridgetops.  They formed in a thin layer of loess or silty slope alluvium and the underlying residuum from clayey shales and cherty dolomite or cherty limestone. Slopes range from 2 to l5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Macedonia silt loam - on a slope of 2 percent under mixed hardwood at an elevation of 835 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed hardwood forest litter. 

   A--2 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 2 percent chert gravel; many worm channels and casts; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick) 

   E--4 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; many fine pores; 2 percent chert gravel; common worm channels and casts; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick) 

   BA--8 to 16 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; common fine pores; 6 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick) 

   2Bt1--16 to 22 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; common fine roots; few fine pores; patchy yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent chert gravel; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick) 

   2Bt2--22 to 38 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silty clay; many medium distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) mottles; strong fine and very fine angular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; continuous yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent chert gravel; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick) 

   2Bt3--38 to 50 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silty clay; many medium distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) and gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; firm; few very fine roots; patchy yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay films on faces of peds; 3 percent chert gravel; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 40 inches thick) 

   2Bt4--50 to 68 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly clay; many medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/6), gray (10YR 6/1), and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine angular blocky; very firm; thick continuous yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent chert gravel; extremely acid. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Ripley County, Missouri; four and one-half miles east of Wilderness; 1,900 feet east and 2,150 feet south of the SW corner of sec. 31, T. 25 N., R. 1 W; USGS Handy topographic quadrangle, latitude 36 degrees 47 minutes 09 seconds N. and longitude 91 degrees 06 minutes 40 seconds W., CONUS 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than l00 inches.  Rock fragments larger than 3 inches are less than 5 percent within the particle-size control section and 5 to 10 percent below.  Gravel content is usually less than 15 percent in the particle size control section, but can have individual horizons that range to 25 percent.  Below the particle size control section the rock fragment content ranges up to 50 percent.  Approximately 75 percent of the chert content is 1/4 inch to 3 inches in size.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to extremely acid with acidity increasing with increasing depth. 

The A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Gravel content is 0 to 35 percent.

The E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture in the A horizon is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. Gravel content is 0 to 35 percent.

The BA, AB, or Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly silty clay loam, or silty clay loam. 

The 2Bt horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR and rarely 5YR and 2.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay in the upper part and silty clay or clay in the lower part, but gravelly textures are within the range.  Most pedons have mottles in the lower part of the B2t that are either redder or grayer than the matrix color. 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Canmer, Frederick, Monteagle, and Sugarhol series. Camner, Frederick, and Monteagle soils typically have redder hue in the argillic horizon.  Sugerhol soils have rounded rock fragments from alluvium. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Macedonia soils are on ridgetops and side slopes. Slope gradients range from 2 to 15 percent.  In most places they occupy fairly broad ridges above very cherty soils on steep slopes.  The soils formed in a thin layer of loess or silty slope alluvium and the underlying residuum from clayey shales and cherty dolomite or cherty limestone. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Captina, Clarksville, Coulstone, Doniphan, Lebanon, Poynor, Viraton, and Wilderness soils.  The high rock fragment content of their upper solums distinguishes Clarksville, Coulstone, Doniphan, and Poynor soils from the Macedonia soils.  These cherty soils are on steeper slopes or narrow ridgetops.  A fragipan distinguishes the Captina, Lebanon, Viraton, and Wilderness soils from the Macedonia soils.  These soils are on the wider ridgetops generally upslope from the Macedonia soils. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to medium runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in hardwood forest. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Ozarks Highland region (MLRA 116A) of southern Missouri and northwest Oklahoma. The series is moderately extensive.
