MASSBACH SERIES

The Massbach series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in 75 to 125 centimeters of loess and residuum from calcareous clayey Maquoketa or Decorah shale of Ordovician Age. These soils are on gently undulating to rolling shale ridges and side slopes on uplands. Slope ranges from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 863 millimeters.
