MELLOR SERIES

The Mellor series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Mellor soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, lake plains, flood plains and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Knull and McDermott series. 

Knull soils have less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. McDermott soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 12.0 degrees C. and include 2.5Y and 5Y hues in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mellor soils are alluvial fans, alluvial flats, flood plains, lake plains, and lake terraces at elevations of 1,280 to 1,830 meters. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. They formed in alluvium from sandstone, shale, limestone and lacustrine sediments. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual air temperatures range from 7 to 12 degrees C. Mean summer temperatures are 18.5 to 20.5 degrees C. Average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm. Freeze-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bram, Genola, Harding, Manassa Quaker and Woodrow soils. Bram, Genola, Manassa, Quaker, and Woodrow soils do not have a natric horizon. Harding soils have a fine particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well and moderately well drained; slow to high runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing. Potential vegetation is greasewood, shadscale and squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and northern Utah, western Nevada and southern Idaho. MLRA D28A, D26 B11. The series is moderately extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 18 cm (A1, A2 horizons)
Albic horizon - The zone from 0 to 18 cm (A1, A2 horizons)
Natric horizon - The zone from 18 to 41 cm (Btn1, Btn2 horizons)
Secondary carbonates - The zone from 41 to 102 cm (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 18 to 41 cm (Btn1, Btn2 horizons).

In July 1994 the classification changed from xerollic to xeric based on the Aridisol amendment.
