MADERBAK SERIES

The Maderbak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The Maderbak soils are on summits and side slopes of hills and mountains Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maderbak very gravelly clay loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 25 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles and stones.

    A--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium vesicular pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--8 to 23 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of ped and bridging sand grains; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bt2--23 to 43 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common prominent clay films on faces of ped and bridging sand grains; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 28 cm thick)

    Bk--43 to 74 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; common fine soft carbonate filaments and masses; common fine carbonate coats on all surfaces of gravel; 45 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (25 to 43 cm thick)

    R--74 cm; hard andesitic bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  White Pine County, Nevada; approximately 3 miles south of Gardner Ranch and 1,200 feet south and 2,550 feet east of the northwest corner of section 25, T. 13 N., R. 60 E.; USGS Badger Hole Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 57 minutes 49 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 10 minutes 43 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9636111 latitude, -115.1786111 .

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry mid-July through early October, except for 10 to 20 days in the summer due to convection storms; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to argillic: 8 to 15 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, dominantly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5.
Chroma:  2 through 4.

Bt horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist,
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay.
Structure:  Subangular or angular blocky.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Bk horizon
Value:  4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry.
Chroma:  4 through 6.
Texture:  Very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly silty clay, or very gravelly clay.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Secondary carbonates:  Many thin to thick carbonate threads, and moderately thick to thick carbonate pendants on undersides of rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Berning, Bilbo, Clenage, Havingdon, Lambranch, Pula, Pulcan, Surgem, Tanawit, Tenmile, Vanwyper and Zephan series. 

Berning, Bilbo, Lambranch, Pula, Tanawit and Tenmile soils do not have bedrock within 100 cm.  Clenage, Havingdon, Surgem and Vanwyper soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer due to convection storms. Pulcan and Zephan soils have paralithic contact within 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maderbak soils are on side slopes and summits of hills and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from igneous rocks such as andesite and welded tuffs.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Atlow series.  It has a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section and has bedrock within 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, galleta, squirreltail, needleandthread, and Douglas rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-Central Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
