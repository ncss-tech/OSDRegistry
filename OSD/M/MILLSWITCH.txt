MILLSWITCH SERIES

The Millswitch series consist of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from limestone and dolomite.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryepts

TYPE LOCATION: Saguache County, Colorado; about 4 miles east of Sargents, Colorado; within an unsectionized area of Gunnison National Forest, estimated to be in Section 19, T. 48 N., R. 6 E.; USGS Pahlone Peak topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees, 23 minutes, 43 seconds north and longitude 106 degrees, 20 minutes, 47 seconds west, NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depths in this section are measured from the top of the mineral soil surface.

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section (smcs) is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with the exception of a significant increase in July and August.  The smcs is driest during the fall.  The smcs is too dry for Udic and is considered to have an Ustic soil moisture regime.
