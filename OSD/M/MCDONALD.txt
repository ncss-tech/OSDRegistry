MCDONALD SERIES 

The McDonald series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till, glaciolacustrine deposits and tertiary deposits. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills and glacial moraines. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0550, MT0634 and MT1127. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (Ap, A horizons); an albic horizon from 10 to 14 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 14 to 42 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section that is the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt1, Bt2 horizons). McDonald soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime bordering on ustic.
