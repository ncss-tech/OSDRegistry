MARKAGUNT SERIES

The Markagunt series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and residuum derived from limestone, sandstone, mudstone.  Markagunt soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 457 millimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid lithic Argiustolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ratonwest(NM) and Sinnigam(MT) series. Ratonwest soils overlie basalt bedrock and are in MLRA 35. Sinnigam soils overlie sandstone and are in MLRAs 54, 58A, 43B, and 46.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Markagunt soils are mapped on summit and interfluve positions of plateaus and mountains
Parent material: eolian derived from limestone, sandstone, mudstone and residuum derived from limestone.

The Detra soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to deep and are on plateau side slopes.  The Kolob soils are moderately deep to deep and are on plateaus. The Dalcan soils are moderately deep to deep and are on lava flows on plateaus.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES PROPOSED:  Washington County, Utah, Zion National Park soil survey area, USA.  The name Markagunt is derived from the Markagunt Plateau.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 1 to 19 inches (3 to 49cm). (A, Bt1, Bt2)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 19 inches (11 to 49cm).  (Bt1,Bt2) Lithic contact:  The contact is at 19 inches (49cm) with limestone.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
