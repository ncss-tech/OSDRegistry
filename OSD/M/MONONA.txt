MONONA SERIES

The Monona series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on loess hills and on risers and treads on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters (29 inches).
