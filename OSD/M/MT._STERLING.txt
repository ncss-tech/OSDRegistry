MT. STERLING SERIES

The Mt. Sterling series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains or alluvial fans in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Woodinville series.
Woodinville--does not have a buried soil within the series control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material--alluvium
Landform--flood plains or alluvial fans in river valleys
Slope--0 to 5 percent
Elevation--155 to 460 meters above mean sea level
Mean annual air temperature--8 to 12 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--840 to 1,040 millimeters
Frost-free period--170 to 210 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coppock, Nodaway, Vesser, and Wabash soils.
Coppock--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Mt. Sterling soils and have an albic horizon
Nodaway--are on slightly higher landscape positions typically closer to the stream channel and do not have a buried soil in the upper two thirds of the series control section
Vesser--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Mt. Sterling soils and have an albic horizon
Wabash--are on landscape positions similar to those of the Mt. Sterling soils and have a clay content that averages 45 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated from the soil surface to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest period of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10 micrometers per second in the upper materials and 0.1 to 1.0 micrometers per second in the buried materials
Flooding--rarely to frequently flooded for brief to long periods can occur in any month during the year due to precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grain and forage.  The native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Bluejoint Grasses, White Cutgrasses, Fox Sedges, Oval Sedges, Inland Rushes, Torreys Rushes, Dark Green Bulrushes, Flatstem Spikerushes, Blue Vervains, Indian Hemps, Winged Loosestrifes, Wild Mints, and Water Horehounds.
