MANISTEE SERIES

The Manistee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to clayey materials. They formed in sandy lacustrine deposits and outwash and the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Manistee soils are on large lake plains and smaller lake plains within outwash plains, till plains, and ground moraines. Slope gradients are commonly 2 to 12 percent but range from 0 to about 50 percent. They formed in sandy lacustrine deposits and outwash and the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranging from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 8.3 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allendale, Au Gres, Croswell, Fibre, Kalkaska, Kellogg, Melita, Ontonagon, Rubicon, Superior, and Wakeley soils. The moderately well drained Kellogg soil, the somewhat poorly drained Allendale, and the poorly drained Fibre and Wakeley soils form a drainage sequence with Manistee. The Kellogg and the Allendale soils are in slightly lower landscape positions and the Fibre and Wakeley soils are in depressions. The Kalkaska, Rubicon, and Melita soils are somewhat excessively drained or excessively drained, sandy associates and the Ontonagon and Superior soils are well drained or moderately well drained clayey associates on similar landscape positions. The moderately well drained Croswell and somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils are in slightly lower landscape positions and are common sandy associates of the Manistee soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is low to very high depending on the slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy part and moderately low or low in the underlying clayey part. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy part and slow or very slow in the underlying clayey part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Manistee soils are in woodland or in idle cropland. Forest vegetation is chiefly northern hardwoods. A small amount is under cultivation with small grain and hay the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 92, 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, 95A, 96, and 98 in the northern half of the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northern Wisconsin. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizons).
Albic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 28 cm (8 to 11 inches) (E horizon) and from 71 to 76 cm (28 to 30 inches) (E' horizon).
