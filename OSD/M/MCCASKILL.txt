MCCASKILL SERIES

The McCaskill series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments of marine origin. These soils are on level to gently sloping interfluves of the Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, thermic Aquic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON: McCaskill fine sandy loam in woodland. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated).

	A--0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam; common dark yellowish brown(10YR 4/4) mottles; weak fine and medium subangular structure; friable; common very fine, fine, and very coarse roots; slightly acid clear smooth boundary. 

	E--10 to 33 (4 to 13 in); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam; many medium prominent yellowish brown(10YR 5/6) iron accumulations; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and coarse roots; 10 percent by volume sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

	Bt1--33 to 58 cm (13 to 23 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron accumulations, many medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions, and few medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) iron accumulations; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; few patchy distinct clay films; 2 percent by volume sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. 

	Bt2--58 to 94 cm (23 to 37 in); variegated light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and gray (10YR 6/1) loam; many medium prominent yellowish brown(10YR 5/8) iron accumulations; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine, few medium, and coarse roots; few patchy distinct clay films; 2 percent by volume sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

	Bt3--94 to 155 cm (37 to 61 in); variegated yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), and light gray (10YR 7/1) silt loam; common fine prominent dark red(2.5YR 3/6) iron accumulations; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine and few medium roots; few patchy distinct clay films; slightly brittle and compact in about 5 percent of the yellowish brown part of the matrix; 5 percent plinthite; 5 percent by volume sandstone fragments less than 8 cm (3 in) in diameter; very strongly acid; clear irregular boundary.

	Bt4--155 to 203 cm (61 to 80 in); gray (10YR 6/1) loam; many coarse prominent reddish brown(2.5YR 4/4) iron and manganese accumulations, common medium prominent yellowish brown(10YR 5/6) iron accumulations; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; firm, very few fine roots; common distinct discontinuous clay films; 2 percent by volume sandstone fragments less than 8 cm (3 in) in diameter; slightly brittle and compact in about 25 percent of the reddish brown part of the matrix ; 10 percent plinthite; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Pike County, Arkansas; SE1/4 NE1/4 SW1/4 Sec 9 T9S R24W; PISFGAH USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 33 degrees, 58 minutes, 38.94 seconds N.,
Longitude: 93 degrees, 34 minutes, 19.08 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness exceeds 152 cm (60 in). The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout, except in areas where the surface layer has been limed.  The control section, the upper 50 cm (20 in) of the Bt horizon, has 8 to 12 percent clay, and it has more than 50 percent silt.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McCaskill soils are on interfluves in the Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain. These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in loamy marine deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent, but most areas of the soils have slopes between 1 and 3 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gurdon, Kizzia, Smithdale, and Stelltown soils. 
Gurdon soils are on stream terraces and formed from alluvium.
Kizzia soils are on similar landscapes and have a fragipan.
Stelltown soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landscapes.
Smithdale soils are well drained, located in gently rolling to sloping uplands, and  have a Bt horizon redder than hue of 7.5YR. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability. Water is perched at a depth of 30 to 46 cm (1.0 to 1.5 ft) below the surface during wet seasons late in winter and early in spring. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pasture and forest. Forested areas are chiefly in mixed hardwoods and some pines.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain of Arkansas and possibly Okalahoma.
