MUTANG SERIES

The Mutang series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic alluvium on pediments, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Mutang extremely gravelly sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 65 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 5 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and in pores; 40 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--5 to 15 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very stick and very plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on ped faced and in pores; 15 percent gravel; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 9 to 17 inches)

    2Cr--15 to 22 inches; weathered granite. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    2R--22 inches; granite.

TYPE LOCATION: Mohave County, Arizona; located at a latitude of 34 degrees, 41 minutes, 05 seconds north and a longitude of 113 degrees, 47 minutes, 18 seconds west; 600 feet east, 2400 feet south of the northwest corner section 36, T. 16 N., R. 15 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December - February and for less than 20 days cumulative during July - September.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Depth to bedrock: 10 to 20 inches

Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline

Soil Temperature: 61 to 70 degrees F.


A horizon

Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR

Value: 4 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma: 2 through 4, dry or moist

Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent gravel


Bt horizons

Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR

Value: 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Texture: sandy clay, clay, clay loam (averages more than 35 percent clay)

Rock fragments: 5 to 35 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Topock series.  Topock soils have hues that are redder than 7.5YR in the surface horizon and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative during July - September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mutang soils are on pediments, hills and mountains at elevations of 2,800 to 5,400 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in mixed igneous and metamorphic alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nickel, Razorback, Tumarion and Wikieup soils.  Nickel soils are loamy-skeletal and very deep.  Wikieup and Razorback soils are loamy-skeletal.  Tumarion soils have a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes black grama, desert needlegrass, sideoats grama, flattop buckwheat, range ratany and broom snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  Mutang soils are of limited extent.  MLRA is 30.
