MILLESON SERIES

The Milleson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and interbedded sedimentary rock. These soils are on floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 205 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Aquicambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Milleson sandy clay loam in irrigated hayland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oe--0 to 4 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; clear smooth boundary (0 to 8 cm thick).

 A--4 to 18 cm; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) sandy clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3), dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redox concentrations; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 10 cm thick)

 Bk--18 to 25 cm; olive gray (5Y 5/2) sandy clay loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2), dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 40 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redox concentrations; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 40 cm thick)

 BCk--25 to 65 cm; olive (5Y 5/3) sandy clay loam, pale olive (5Y 6/3), dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 35 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redox concentrations; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

 C1--65 to 85 cm; olive (5Y 5/3) fine sandy loam, pale olive (5Y 6/3), dry; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 15 percent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redox concentrations; finely disseminated carbonate; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 60 cm thick)

 C2--85 to 200 cm; olive (5Y 5/4) fine sandy loam, pale olive (5Y 6/4), dry; massive; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; finely disseminated carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
