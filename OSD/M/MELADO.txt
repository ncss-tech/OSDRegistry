MELADO SERIES

The Melado series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium. Melado soils are on alluvial flats of the Presidio Bolson. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Melado soils are on alluvial flats of the Presidio Bolson at elevations of 1,800 to 3,995 feet. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. These soils formed in clayey alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Changas (T-TX) series, Corazones (TX), and Pantera (TX) series. Changas soils have densic bedrock within 20 inches of the surface and occur on fan remnants. Corazones soils have a calcic horizon and occur on fan remnants. Pantera soils are in a sandy-skeletal textural family and occur in drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is medium on slopes less than 1 percent, high on 1 to 5 percent, and very high on 5 to 12 percent. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Desert Shrubland vegetative zone. Native vegetation consists of fourwing saltbush, mound saltbush, and alkali sacaton. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West Texas. MLRA 42. The series is of minor extent.
