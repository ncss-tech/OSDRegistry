MILES SERIES

The Miles series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial materials.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping terrace pediments on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees C (16.7 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abilene, Bukreek, Delwin, Devol, Frankirk, Grandfield, Hamby, Heatly, Sagerton, Springer, and Wichita series.
Abilene, Bukreek, Frankirk, and Sagerton: These soils have a mollic epipedon.
Devol and Springer: These soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Heatly: These soils have a sandy surface more than 51 cm (20 in) thick).
Wichita: These soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated; cotton, wheat, and grain sorghum are the principle crops.  Native vegetation on the loamy fine sands is little bluestem and switchgrass; fine sandy loam surfaces include sideoats and blue grama.  Mesquite, lotebush, catclaw, and sand sagebrush invade some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C) and Rolling Limestone Prairies (MLRA 78D) of Texas and Oklahoma.  The series is extensive.
