MANTADOR SERIES

The Mantador series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous moderately coarse glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on delta and lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Pachic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mantador fine sandy loam - on a plane, nearly level slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.  Where described, the soil was moist throughout.)

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 51 centimeters (Ap1, Ap2 and Bw1 horizons)- the Bw2 horizon has the color, but not the organic matter to be mollic; calcic horizon - the zone from 69 to 100 centimeters (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons); characteristics associated with wetness - redoximorphic features within a depth of 40 cm, hue of 10YR and chroma of 2 within 75 centimeters (Bw1 horizon).
