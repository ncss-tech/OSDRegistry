MONETA SERIES 

The Moneta series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy, calcareous till on uplands.  The slope ranges from 6 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature averages 47 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Dissected glacial till plains and moraines 
Landform: Convex shoulder slopes 
Elevation: 244 to 457 meters (800 to 1,500 feet) above sea level
Parent Material: Loamy calcareous till
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 7 to 10 C. (45 to 50 degrees F).
Mean Annual Precipitation: 660 to 760 mm (26 to 30 inches)
Frost Free Period: 145 to 160 days
Slope: 6 to 45 percent

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Annton (T), Cornell, Everly, North Twin (T), Sac, and Walnut Grove (T) soils.
Annton soils are on summits and backslopes and are deeper to carbonates. 
Cornell soils are well drained and have argillic horizons. 
Everly and North Twin soils are moderately well drained and are deeper to carbonates.
Sac soils are moderately well drained and formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess over glacial till.
Walnut Grove soils are somewhat poorly drained and lower lying. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained--seasonally high saturation occurs at depths greater than 6 feet.
Permeability: 1.41 TO 14.11 micrometers per second (.2 to 2 inches per hour)
Surface runoff: high

USE AND VEGETATION: Steeper areas are typically used for permanent pasture or woodland with less steep areas in row crops. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Iowa and Southern Minnesota in MLRAs 103 and 107.  These soils are of minor extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rock County, Minnesota, 2002

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches; cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to a depth of 80 inches (Bw, Bk and BC horizons); udic moisture regime;  the Bk horizons do not meet the criteria for a calcic horizon as they lack an increase of 5 percent calcium carbonate increase above a lower horizon.

Although typically an MLRA-107 soil, it was recongized in MLRA-103 on in a geomorphic area of firm, early Wisconsin till.
