Aragon soils have chert fragments throughout.  
Cuthbert, Kirvin, Luverne, Sacul, and Sweatman soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have a high content of siderite.  
Kolomoki soils are on stream terraces and formed in fluvial sediments that contain an appreciable amount of silt.  
Nankin soils are less red than the Mahan soils, and they do not contain fragments of ironstone.
