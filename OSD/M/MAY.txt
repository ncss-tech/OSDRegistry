MAY SERIES

The May series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy alluvium. These nearly level and gently sloping soils occur along stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:   These are the Gholson, Lavender, and Personville series in the same family. Similar soils are the Cisco, Duffau, Konawa, Menard, and Weatherford series.
Gholson soils: occur in areas with a MAAT of 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F) or higher and Thornthwaite P-E Index of 50 or more.
Lavender and Personville soils: are 152 cm or less deep to lithic limestone bedrock.
Cisco and Menard soils: have argillic horizons with redder hues and occur in a slightly drier soil moisture regime.  
Konawa soils: have mixed mineralogy and has base saturation of the argillic horizon that ranges from 50 to 75 percent.
Duffau soils: do not have carbonates and have an argillic horizon with redder hues that have clay content that does not decease by more than 20 percent (relative) from the maximum within 152 cm of the soil surface.
Weatherford soils: are 152 cm or less deep to paralithic sandstone bedrock and has base saturation of the argillic horizon that ranges from 50 to 75 percent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy alluvium
Landscape: hills and river valleys
Landform: stream terraces
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 in)
Thornthwaite P-E Index: 40 to 50
Mean annual air temperature: 17.2 to 18.9 degrees C (63 to 66 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 210 to 240 days
Elevation: 213.4 to 609.6 m (700 to 2000 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bosque, Cisco, Duffau, Nimrod, Pedernales, and Windthorst series.  
Bosque soils: have mollic epipedons and are lower in the landscape on flood plains.
Cisco and Duffau soils: occur higher in the landscape on stream divides and along upland drainageways.
Nimrod soils: have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick and are higher in the landscape on stream divides and low ridges.
Pedernales and Windthorst soils: have reddish clayey argillic horizons and are higher in the landscape on hillsides and stream divides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; Permeability is moderate; Runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes. Most of the May soils occur in positions that receive extra water from adjacent higher areas.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated; grain sorghum, peanuts, and truck crops are the principal crops.  Native vegetation is mid and tall grasses and post oak, live oak, and mesquite trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North and central Texas; MLRAs 84B - West Cross Timbers, 80B - Texas North-Central Prairies, and fringe areas of 85 - Grand Prairie. The series is of moderate extent.
