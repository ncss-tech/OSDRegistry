MOTLEY SERIES

The Motley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping dissected stream terraces on alluvial plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Bukreek series.  Similar soils also include the Altus, Chickasha, Frankirk, Grandfield, Miles, Rotan, Sagerton, Tipton, and Wichita series.
Bukreek series: have secondary calcium carbonate within 24 to 33 inches and a calcic horizon within 60 inches.
Altus, Rotan, and Tipton series: have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.
Chickasha series: have a decrease in clay from the maximum by more than 20 percent within a depth of 60 inches.
Frankirk, Sagerton, and Wichita series: have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Grandfield and Miles series: have an ochric epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy calcareous sediments of alluvial origin of Pleistocene age.
Landform: dissected stream terrace on an alluvial plain
Slopes: dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 60 to 66 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 21 to 28 inches.
Frost-free period: 210 to 240 days.
Elevation: 1,150 to 2,200 feet.
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 32 to 44.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bukreek soils, and the Altus, Flomot, Frankirk, Grandfield, Miles, Enterprise, and Woodward series.
Enterprise and Woodward soils have an ochric epipedon and a cambic horizon; in addition Woodward soils formed in noncemented sandstone of Permian age.
Altus, Flomot, Grandfield, and Woodward soils are higher in the landscape.
Bukreek, Frankirk, and Miles soils are on about the same to slightly higher landscape positions.
Enterprise soils are on slightly lower to about the same landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated.  Wheat, cotton, and grain sorghum are the principal crops.  Native vegetation is mainly buffalograss, grama grasses, little bluestem, and mesquite trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Rolling Plains of Texas and possibly southwestern Oklahoma (MLRA 78B and 78C in LRR H).  The soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Motley County, Texas; 1972.

REMARKS:  Series Revised MLRA-77 Soil Survey update of Floyd County, Texas; 2004.  The series classification was revised from fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Udic Paleustolls to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Paleustolls in 2004 based on soil properties and updates to Soil Taxonomy.  These soils have been included in the Miles series.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 17 inches. (A & Bt1 horizon)
Argillic horizon: 9 to 84 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, & Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon: 56 to 84 inches. (Btk horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA:  none.
