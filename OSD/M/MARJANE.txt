MARJANE SERIES  

The Marjane series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to sandstone.  Marjane soils formed in eolian and residuum derived from sandstone on footslopes of undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Calciargids  

TYPICAL PEDON: Marjane fine sandy loam -- on an undulating plateau sloping 4 percent to the west at 5,890 feet elevation -- rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described, the soil was moist from 2 to 26 inches and otherwise dry throughout.)  

    A--0 to 2 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate very coarse platy structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 or 3 inches thick)  

    BA--2 to 11 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)  

    Bt--11 to 18 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 22 inches thick)  

    Btk--18 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; violently effervescent, secondary calcium carbonate segregated in few fine irregularly shaped soft masses and as accumulations on ped faces; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 17 inches thick)  

    2R--28 inches; sandstone.  

TYPE LOCATION: Apache County, Arizona; on the Navajo Indian Reservation  about 5 miles southeast of Red Mesa Trading Post; 1,450 feet north and 2,450 feet east of the southwest corner of section 10, T.40 N., R.28 E.;  Latitude 36 degrees 53 minutes 10 seconds North and Longitude 109 degrees 19 minutes 41 seconds West.  

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from April 15 to July 1.  It is intermittently moist in some part from July through October and December to April 15.  Is dry in all parts between 50 and 75 percent of the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.  

Soil temperature - 52 to 54 degrees F.  

Reaction - slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline  

Clay content: 10 to 18 percent  

Depth to base of argillic horizon - 20 to 40 inches  

Depth to secondary calcium carbonate - 18 to 28 inches  

Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches  

A horizon  
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist  
Chroma: 4 or 6, dry or moist  
Organic carbon: 0.4 to 0.6 percent  
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent  

BA horizon  
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist  
Organic carbon: 0.2 to 0.4 percent  
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent  
Texture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam  

Bt and Btk horizons  
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist  
Chroma: 4 or 6, dry or moist  
Organic carbon: 0.2 to 0.4 percent  
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 10 percent  
Texture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam  

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Khapo (NM), Palma (NM), Vonid (CO) and Windwhistle (UT) series.  Khapo and Palma soils are very deep. Vonid soils are in LRR-G MLRA 69 and are more moist in May and June. Windwhistle soils have a calcic horizon closer to the surface.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marjane soils are on footslopes of undulating plateaus.  They formed in eolian and residuum derived from sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arches, Kitsili, and Mido soils.  Arches soils are shallow to sandstone bedrock and occur on structural benches.  Kitsili soils are very deep, have cambic horizons, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus.  Mido soils are very deep, sandy, and occur on stable dunes.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Marjane soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, blue grama, galleta, broom snakeweed, Greene rabbitbrush and Cutler Mormon-tea, with scattered Utah juniper and Wyoming big sagebrush.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Marjane soils are of small extent on the Blanding Basin portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.
