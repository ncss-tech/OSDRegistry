MINEHART SERIES

The Minehart series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and metamorphic rocks. Minehart soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C. The frost-free season is 180 to 240 days.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Paleargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Minehart gravelly fine sandy loam, on a 5 percent slope under desert rangeland at an elevation of 1,397 meters. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). The soil surface is covered by approximately 50 percent gravel, 3 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Minehart soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and metamorphic rocks. Elevations are 1,300 to 1,450 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 230 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 17 to 19 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Hartpeak, Hoppswell and Ustidur soils. Hartpeak soils have bedrock at 50 to 75 centimeters and occur on back slopes of hills and mountains. Hoppswell soils have a loamy-skeletal control sections and are found on nearby fan remnants. Ustidur soils have a duripan, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on ballenas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly galleta, bush muhly, black grama, Coopers goldenbush and banana yucca. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California; MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: PHOENIX, ARIZONA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Bernardino County, California; Crescent Peak Grazing Allotment, part of the Mojave National Preserve Soil Survey Area, California, 2007. The name is coined from Hart mine located in northern Lanfair Valley.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:

1. Ochric epipedon - 0 to 7 centimeters (0 to 3 inches). (A horizon)
2. Argillic horizon - 7 to 52 centimeters (3 to 21 inches). (Bt, Btk1 and Btk2 horizons)
3. Particle-size control section - 7 to 52 centimeters (3 to 21 inches). (Bt, Btk1 and Btk2 horizons)
4. Note: There is a clay increase of 15 percent or more in the argillic horizon within 2.5 centimeters.
