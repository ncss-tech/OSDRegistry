MONIDA SERIES

The Monida series consists of very deep and well drained soils on fan remnants, foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  They formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from calcareous siltstone, sandstone and loess.  The mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Monida silt loam; supporting a mountain big sagebrush/Idaho fescue plant association, rangeland; on a 17 percent slope with a south aspect at 6625 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 15 inches thick)

     Bk--38 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; common filaments and few fine (less than 5 mm) masses of soft powdery lime in matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Accola, Madigan (T), Michelson, Morset, Oro Fino and Philipsburg series.  The Accola, Madigan, Michelson, Morset, Oro Fino and Philipsburg soils have ustic moisture regimes.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Monida soils are on fan remnants, foothills and mountains.  Slopes range from 4 to 45 percent. Elevations range from 6,000 to 9,600 feet.  The soil formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from calcareous siltstone, sandstone and loess.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 19 inches.  It falls dominantly in the late autumn through early summer.  A winter snowpack of 1 to 3 feet lasting through March is common.  Summers are warm and dry.  The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F.  The frost free season is 30 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Meegero, Zeale and Zeebar series.  Each of these soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Meegero soils occur intermixed with Monida soils on foothills and mountains.  They have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches thick, lack an argillic horizon and have greater than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section.  Zeale and Zeebar soils occur intermixed with Monida soils on fan remnants.  Zeale soils lack an argillic horizon and have greater than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle size control section.  Zeebar soils lack accumulations of secondary carbonates.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Monida soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat.  These soils dominantly support a mountain big sagebrush/Idaho fescue plant association.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southcentral Idaho.  The soil is of small extent.
