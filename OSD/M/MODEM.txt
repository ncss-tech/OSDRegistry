MODEM SERIES

The Modem series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and calcareous loess. Modem soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy, mesic, shallow Vitritorrandic Durixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Modem very gravelly ashy sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 40 percent gravel. Lithology of the fragments is welded tuff.

(5 to 13 cm thick) 

 Btkq1--10 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; many very fine, common fine and few medium tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; few faint clay films on faces of peds; common (10 percent) distinct secondary calcium carbonate and silica concretions on the bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. 

 Btkq2--18 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly ashy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel, of which 20 percent are indurated pan fragments; common faint clay films on faces of peds; common (10 percent) distinct secondary calcium carbonate and silica concretions on the bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); very abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Btkq horizons is 15 to 46 cm.) 

 Bqkm1--25 to 64 cm; white (10YR 8/1) cemented material, light gray (10YR 7/1) moist; strong very thick platy structure; very rigid, indurated by secondary silica and calcium carbonate, with a 1 to 5 mm thick laminar cap; violently effervescent; gradual smooth boundary. 

 Bqkm2--64 to 117 cm; white (10YR 8/1) cemented material, light gray (10YR 7/1) moist; massive; very rigid, indurated by secondary silica and calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bqkm horizons is 50 to 127 cm.) 

 Bkqy--117 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; few distinct secondary calcium carbonate and silica concretions around rock fragments; few faint secondary gypsum concretions on the bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Modem soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium from welded tuff and calcareous loess. The climate is dry and semiarid. Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,845 to 2,525 meters. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 to 360 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 7 to 10 degrees C and the frost-free period is about 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ravendog and Jarab series. Ravendog soils occur on inset fan and drainageway positions, and do not have a duripan or an argillic horizon. Jarab soils occur on fan remnants and do not have an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; saturated moderately high hydraulic conductivity class. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Modem soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation includes bluebunch wheatgrass, Thurbers needlegrass, needleandthread, muttongrass, mountain big sagebrush, and antelope bitterbrush. This pedon is correlated to Ecological Site R028AY088NV, Gravelly Clay 12-14" P.Z. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. The soils are not extensive. MLRA 28A.
