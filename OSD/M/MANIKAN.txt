MANIKAN SERIES

The Manikan series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium on stream terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Manikan silty clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    C--4 to 23 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

    Ck1--23 to 34 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, few fine calcium carbonate filaments and threads; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

    Ck2--34 to 46 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, few fine calcium carbonate filaments and threads; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    C--46 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Coconino County, Arizona; about 30 miles south of Colorado City; 400 feet east and 1800 feet south of the northwest corner of section 21, T. 36 N, R. 6 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 47 to 57 degrees F.

Rock fragments - 0 to 5 percent gravel

Gypsum - 0 to 5 percent

Calcium carbonate equivalent - 5 to 15 percent in the control section

Organic carbon - decreases irregularly with depth

Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline

Texture - Silty clay loam with thin 1/4 to 2 inch strata of clay, silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand; averages more than 15 percent sand and 18 percent clay in the control section

A horizon
Hue:  2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

C horizon
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  3 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Barnum (WY), Hamburn (NM), Haverdad (WY), Haversid (CO), Panitchen (CO), San Mateo (NM) and Suwanee (NM).  Barnum soils have an exchangeable sodium percentage ranging from 4 to 15.  Hamburn soils have a mean annual precipitation of 7 inches and contain 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section.   Haverdad and Haversid soils have 2.5Y or 10YR hues.  Panitchen soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section, ESP of 2 to 15 and accumulations of gypsum in the C horizons.  San Mateo soils have hues of 10YR or yellower.  Suwanee soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for considerably longer periods due to a lower rainfall component.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Manikan soils are on stream terraces and flood plains of Holocene age.  These soils formed in stratified mixed alluvium from sandstone and shale.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations are 4400 to 5500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barx and Monierco soils.   Barx soils have argillic horizons.  Monierco soils are less than 20 inches deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly galleta, fourwing saltbush, big sagebrush and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  The Manikan series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
