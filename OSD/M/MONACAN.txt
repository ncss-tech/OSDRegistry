MONACAN SERIES

Soils of the Monacan series are deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in recent alluvial sediments of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain.  Slopes are commonly less than 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Monacan silt loam - in a cultivated field.
(Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap--0 to 12 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots; few very fine dark colored oxide concretions;
few fine flakes of mica; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0
to 12 inches thick)

     Bw1--12 to 25 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; few fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light yellowish brown
(10YR 6/4), and dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine dark colored oxide concretions and stains; few worm channels; few fine flakes of mica; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 15 inches thick)

     Bw2--25 to 34 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and brown (7.5YR 4/4) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable,
slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine dark colored oxide stains and concretions; few fine flakes of mica;
medium acid; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

     Bw3--34 to 42 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam; few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and gray (10YR 5/1) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable,
slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine dark colored oxide concretions and stains; few fine flakes of mica;
medium acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (7 to 18 inches thick)

     2Bgb--42 to 63 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) clay; few fine distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm, sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; thin patchy gray (5Y 5/1) clay films on faces of ped and in root channels; many dark colored oxide concretions up to 1/4 inch in size; many fine flakes of mica;
medium acid; gradual wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Goochland County, Virginia; .2 miles south of the intersection of Highways 6 and 644 and 130 yards northeast of the James River on Sabot Island.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Coarse fragments are less than 5 percent by volume above
40 inches.  Content of flakes of mica ranges from none to many.
The reaction is neutral to strongy acid throughout the profile.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam,
or silt loam.

The B horizon has a hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The lower part of the B horizon includes
hue of 5Y and chroma of 1.  The B horizon is sandy loam, loam,
silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The Bb horizon, where present, is below 40 inches.  It has hue of 10YR through 5Y or N, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It
is silty clay or clay.

The C horizon ranges from clay through sand or gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  Lindell series is the only soil in the same family.  Lindell soils have up to 30 percent coarse fragment of
chert or of gravel and contains medium to high phosphorous in each horizon.

Competing soils in closely related families are Chewacla,
Congaree, Hamben, Hannahatchee, Kemp, Lobdell, Marietta,
Mooreville, Riverview, Thenas, Tuckahoe and Weaver.  Chewacla, Mooreville, and Riverview soils have a base saturation of less
than 60 percent.  Congaree, Hannahatchee, and Tuckahoe soils do
not have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the surface.  Hamben and Marietta soils are in a siliceous family.
Kemp soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Lobdell and Weaver soils are in a mesic family.  Thenas soils are in a corase-loamy family.  soils are in a coarse-loamy family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monacan soils formed in recent alluvium in nearly level flood plains in the Piedmont and upper Coastal Plain.  Slopes are commonly less than 2 percent.  The loamy sediments are largely derived from soils formed in residuum from schist, gneiss, granite, phyllite, and other metamorphic and igneous rocks.  The
mean annual temperature ranges from about 61 to 66 degrees F and
the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 39 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Tuckahoe soils, these are the Bolling, Buncombe, Fork, Pamunkey,
and Wehadkee soils.  Buncombe soils are in the sandy family.  Bolling, Fork, and Pamunkey soils are Alfisols.  Wehadkee soils
are Fluvaquents.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well and somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability above the buried soil.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are used for crops or pasture.  Corn, soybeans, small grains and hay are the principal crops.  The remainder is in woodland.  Forests consist of mixed hardwoods and pines.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Virginia and North Carolina.  The series
is of small extent.
