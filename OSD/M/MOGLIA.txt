USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used primarily for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.

In excellent condition, mid grasses dominate; blackbrush and lotebush are dominant woody plants; the major forbs are velvet bundleflower, orange zexmenia and bushsunflower. As retrogression occurs, woody plants, especially blackbrush, increase in density. Grasses which increase or invade are red grama, Hall's panicum, threeawns, and Texas bristlegrass. The ecological site is Saline Clay Loam, 18-35 PZ (R083BY433TX).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization analyses of the typical pedon were determined by the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; Lab Sample Nos. 80-897 to 80-902. Selected analyses of two satellite pedons were also determined by NSSL; Lab Sample Nos. 80-903 to 80-908. Particle size analysis was performed at the local project office for 4 pedons from Duval County. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from Webb County, Texas.  User Pedon ID: 79TX479004 and 79TX479005.
