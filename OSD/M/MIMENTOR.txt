MIMENTOR SERIES

The Mimentor series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Mimentor soils are on fan remnants and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

 Bq2--89 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent distinct moderately cemented durinodes; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

TYPE LOCATION: Douglas County, Nevada; in Carson Valley about 7.5 kilometers east of the Douglas County Airport; about 1,200 feet south and 2,100 feet west of the northeast corner of section 18, T. 13 N., R. 21 E.; USGS Gardnerville 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 59 minutes 39.46 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 39 minutes 57.91 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9942944 latitude, -119.6660861 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry in the moisture control section; moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. 
Depth to base of argillic horizon: 30 to 64 cm. 
Depth to horizons with durinodes: 30 to 64 cm.

Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent, mainly gravel. Lithology of fragments are mixed rocks.

A horizons 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; the upper 18 cm of the soil when mixed has a dry value of 6.

Aladshi, Alley Allor, Cleghorn, Glyphs, Nevador, Qwynn and Zevadez soils have secondary carbonates within depths of 100 cm.  In addition, Alley soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in their particle-size control section.  Allor soils lack durinodes and have more than 20 percent rock fragments in their Bqk horizons.  Glyphs soils lack durinodes.  Qwynn soils have 2Bqk horizons with more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Wedertz soils lack durinodes.  Chime soils have paralithic material within 50 to 75 cm.  Igert soils have lithic material within 64 to 100 cm. Wedlar soils have the base of the argillic horizon within 64 to 100 cm and have more than 15 percent rock fragments in their Bq horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mimentor soils are on fan remnants and inset fans. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1375 to 1955 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 255 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chalco, Eastval, Greenbrae, Haybourne and Indian Creek series. Chalco soils have a paralithic contact within 25 to 50 cm and have greater than 35 percent clay in their particle-size control section. Eastval soils have a duripan within 50 to 100 cm. Greenbrae soils have secondary lime accumulation at a depth greater than 75 cm, do not have silica cementation and the base of the argillic horizon is 71 to 122 cm deep. Haybourne soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and do not have an argillic horizon or silica cementation. Indian Creek soils have a duripan at 36 to 50 cm and have greater than 35 percent clay in their particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mimentor soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Nevada and eastern California. These soils are of limited extent. MLRA 26.
