MESMAN SERIES

The Mesman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits with surface mantles of eolian sand. Mesman soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Natrargids

TYPE LOCATION: Lake County, Oregon; in the Warner Valley about 4 miles north-northeast of Plush; in the SE 1/4 of the SW 1/4 of the NE 1/4 of section 4, T. 36 S., R. 24 E.; USGS Plush 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 42 degrees 28 minutes 36 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 53 minutes 25 seconds west longitude, NAD27. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall;  aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric. 
Mean annual soil temperature 8 to 10 degrees C. 
Depth to base of natric horizon: 38 to 76 cm. 
Depth to bedrock: Greater than 150 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 35 percent. 
Sand content: 25 to 50 percent, most of which is very fine sand and fine sand. 
Rock fragments:  0 to 10 percent gravel. 

An horizon 
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Structure: Granular or subangular blocky.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.
Salinity (EC): 2 to 8 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 5 to 30. 

2Btn horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Texture: Loam, sandy loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.

Clay content: 10 to 30 percent.
Rock fragment content:  0 to 10 percent gravel
Structure: Massive but ranges to strong fine and medium angular blocky. Structure is due to consolidation and compaction of the lacustrine sediments (rock structure). Some pedons are single grain.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Antelope Springs, Calnat, Slipback, Tannawasha, and Wespac series. 

Antelope Springs soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR. Calnat soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Slipback soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. and have texture of coarse sandy loam or loamy coarse sand below the natric horizon. Tannawasha soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Wespac soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mesman soils are on lake terraces. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits with surface mantles of eolian sand. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,465 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Helphenstein, Icene, Reese, and Turpin soils. Helphenstein soils are somewhat poorly drained and have EC that is less than 16 mmhos/cm. Icene soils are moderately well drained and have a salic horizon. Reese soils are poorly drained have a very strongly sodic and saline surface and are strongly alkaline throughout. Turpin soils are very strongly alkaline throughout and have EC that is less than 16 mmhos/cm. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mesman soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is basin big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, black greasewood, Indian ricegrass, basin wildrye, and creeping wildrye. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 23.
