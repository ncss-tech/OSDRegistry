MANARD SERIES

The Manard series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and welded tuff on lava plains and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  The average annual precipitation is a bout 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Manard very stony silt loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very stony silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin and very thin  platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very
 friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine  roots; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles and 1 percent  stones; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches  thick)



    A2--3 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very stony silty clay  loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky
 structure parting to strong fine granular; hard, friable, slightly
 sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium
 roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones;
 slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)



    Bt1--9 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark
 brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to
 moderate very fine and fine angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and
 plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common fine
 tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on all faces of peds;  common uncoated sand and silt grains on the vertical faces of peds; 5  percent cobbles and 1 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt  wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)



    Bt2--18 to 26 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay,  dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting  to strong medium angular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and  very plastic; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores;
 continuous moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; 3 to 5 percent
 angular cobbles and 5 percent stones; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt  wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)



    Bqkm--26 to 28 inches; white (10YR 8/1) silica and lime cemented
 hardpan with strong thin plates; very hard, very firm; weakly
 effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (.75 to  4 inches thick)



    R--28 inches; bedrock.


 TYPE LOCATION:  Camas County, Idaho; about 8 miles east and 4.75 miles  south of Fairfield; 1,300 feet west and 2,000 feet north of the
 southeast corner of sec. 2, T. 2 S., R. 15 E.


 RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:


 Soil moisture - usually moist but is dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days  in the summer and autumn
 Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 11 inches thick
 Depth to bedrock - 20 to 38 inches
 Average annual soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.
 Depth to duripan - 20 to 37 inches
 Reaction - slightly acid to mildly alkaline
 BA and Btk horizons are present in some pedons


 A horizon
 Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
 Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist


 Bt horizon
 Hue - 10YR through 5YR
 Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
 Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist
 Texture - SICL, CL, C, or SIC
 Rock fragment content - 0 to 25 percent
 Clay content - 35 to 60 percent


 Bqkm horizon
 Value - 6 through 8 dry
 Chroma - 1 through 3 dry


 COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Budlewis (T), Forvic (T), Hatpeak,
 Peevywell, and Oshone series.  Budlewis soils have a calcic horizon
 above the duripan and a 10 to 14 inch mollic epipedon.  Forvic soils  have a 20 to 30 inch mollic epipedon.  Hatpeak, Peevywell, and Oshone  soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.


 GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Manard soils are on basalt plains and plateaus and
 have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and
 colluvium from basalt and welded tuff.  Elevations range from 4,450 to  6,300 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16
 inches and the average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The  frost-free period is about 70 to 110 days.


 GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gaib, Goodington,
 Harahill, Kevanton, Laurentzen, Magic, and Polecreek soils.  Gaib and  Polecreek soils are 10 to 20 inches to bedrock.  Harahill soils have a  fine-loamy B2 horizon.  Goodington, Kevanton, and Laurentzen soils are  more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Magic soils are clayey
 throughout.  Goodington, Harahill, Kevanton, Laurentzen, Magic, and
 Polecreek soils occur on basalt plains.  Gaib soils are on foothills  and mountains.


 DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; very  slow permeability.


 USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for range, but hay and small grain are
 grown in some areas.  Vegetation is alkali sagebrush, Sandberg
 bluegrass, squirreltail, and Idaho fescue.


 DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern and south-central Idaho.  The  soils are moderately extensive.


 SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Camas County, Idaho, 1977.


 REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizon or features recognized in this pedon are:


 Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of  approximately 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)


 Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 9 to 26 inches (Bt1 and  Bt2 horizons)


 Typic Durixerolls feature - an indurated duripan from approximately 26  to 28 inches.


 Lithic contact - bedrock at about 28 inches.
