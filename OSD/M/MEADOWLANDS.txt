MEADOWLANDS SERIES

The Meadowlands series consists of poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on flats on glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Meadowlands loam, with a level slope, on a glacial lake plain, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 390 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 18 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry, weak fine and medium granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; moderately acid, abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 25 centimeters thick)

    Bg--18 to 51 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and few medium roots; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and few fine faint grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (15 to 51 centimeters thick)

    Bw--51 to 89 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and common fine faint dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; slightly acid, clear wavy boundary. (25 to 51 centimeters thick)

    C1--89 to 102 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) silt loam; massive; friable; few fine roots; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and common fine faint grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) redoximorphic depletions; neutral, gradual wavy boundary. 

    C2--102 to 203 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) silt loam; massive; friable; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations and common medium faint light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) redoximorphic depletions; few fine faint light gray (2.5Y 7/2) masses of carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 88-Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins; St. Louis County, Minnesota; about 1.5 miles northeast of the Meadowlands; located about 200 feet north and 1,600 feet west of the southeast corner of section 11, T. 53N., R. 19W.; USGS Meadowlands topographic quadrangle, latitude 47 degrees 5 minutes 8 seconds N., longitude 92 degrees 42 minutes 33 seconds W., NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to carbonates--50 to 120 centimeters
These soils do not have rock fragments 

Ap or A horizon:
Hue--10YR
Value--2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry
Chroma--1 or 2, 1 or 2 dry
Texture--silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam Reaction--moderately acid to neutral 

Bg horizon:
Hue--10YR or 2.5Y
Value--4 to 6
Chroma--1 or 2
Texture--loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam
Reaction--moderately acid to neutral
The Bg horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations  

Bw horizon:
Hue--10YR to 5Y
Value--3 to 6
Chroma--1 to 3
Texture--loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam or silty clay loam 
Reaction--slightly acid to neutral
The Bw horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations and depletions  

C horizon:
Hue--2.5Y or 5Y
Value--5 or 6
Chroma--1 to 3
Texture--silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam
The fine sand content on a weighted average is less than 30 percent in the lower third of the series control section
Reaction--slightly acid to moderately alkaline
The C horizon typically has distinct to prominent redoximorphic concentrations and depletions 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Delamere, Forada, Runeberg, Skunkcreek and Tiffany series. Delamera, Skunkcreek and Tiffany--the fine sand content on a weighted  average is more than 30 percent in the lower third of the series control section
Forada--sand and loamy sand textures and gravelly horizons with up to 35 percent gravel in the lower third of the series control section
Runeberg--formed in till and contain between 3 to 15 percent rock fragments within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform--flats on glacial lake plains
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711 millimeters
Frost-free period--95 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Leeora and Joula soils which formed in the same parent material as the Meadowlands soils. The Leeora and Joula soils form a hydrosequence with the Meadowlands soils. The somewhat poorly drained Joula soils are on convex positions on the landscape.  The very poorly drained Leeora soils are in drainageways and depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 0.15 meter below the surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--is 1.41 to 42.34 micrometers per second in the upper loamy deposits and 1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second in the lower loamy deposits

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay or used for pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland Province or Superior Upland
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR--K; northern Minnesota
Extent--moderate
