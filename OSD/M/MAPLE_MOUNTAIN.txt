MAPLE MOUNTAIN SERIES

Typically, Maple Mountain soils have dark grayish brown, slightly acid, cobbly loam A horizons
and brown, slightly acid cobbly clay loam B2t horizon8.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Cobbly loam - rangeland
(Colors are for dry solls unless otherwise noted.)

TYPE LOCATION: Beaver County, Utah; 10 miles north and 4 miles west of Manderfield, Utah; 1/2 mile south of NW corner of sec. 1, T.27S., R.8W.

Ran8e ln Characterlstics: The solum is 40 to 50 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature
is 41c to 42xF., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60x to 61xF.
These soils are moist in some part between depths of 4 to 12 inches more than 50 percent of the
tlme the soil temperature ls above 41xF., but are contlnually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days
during the summer months in more than 6 out of 10 years. The Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR or lOYR,
value of 3.5 through 4.5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is soft or slightly hard.
The B2t horizon has hue of 5YR through lOYR with 7.5YR dominant; value in the upper part is 5
dry, 3 moist, and chroma is 2 or 3 to a depth less than 20 inches. The lower part has value of
5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The B2t horizon is cobbly light clay loam
or cobbly clay lDam with the upper 20 inches having a weighted average of 27 to 35 percent clay
and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly cobbles. It has moderate, coarse to fine subangular
blocky structure. This horizon is hard or very hard, firm or very firm, and plastic or very plastic.
Thickness of the combined Bt horizons is 32 to 40 inches. The C horizon is cobbly in some pedons.

Competing Series and their Differentiae: These are the Cloud Rim, Gross, and Kanlee series. Cloud
Rim soils have 18 to 27 percent clay and have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the B2t horizon.
Gross soils are 20 to 40 lnches deep over basalt or andesite bedrock.  Kanlee soils are 20 to
40 inches deep over granlte or quartz monzonlte bedrock.

Setting: Maple Mountain soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 7,100 to 7,700 feet. Slopes
are 10 to 50 percent. The soils formed in deep alluvial and colluvial soil material from intermediate
igneous parent rock. The climate is moist subhumid. Mean annual temperature is about 39x to
40xF., mean summer temperature is about 61x to 62xF., and the average annual precipitation is
about 18 to 20 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 65 to 85 days.

Principal Associated Soils: These are the Yardley and Wallsburg soils.  Yardley soils have more
than 35 percent clay in the B2t horizons and lack rock fragments.  Wallsburg soils have more than
35 percent clay in the control section and have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.

Drainage and Permeability: Well--drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

Use and Vegetation: Used mainly for watershed, wildlife grazing, and grazing by sheep or cattle. Present vegetation is big sagebrush, Gambel oak, snowberry, bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, mutton grass, squirreltail, cheatgrass, tall native poa, and locoweed.

Distribution and Extent: Mountain areas of Southern Utah. This series is inextensive.
