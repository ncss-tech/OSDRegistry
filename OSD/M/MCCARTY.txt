MCCARTY SERIES

The McCarty series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in pedisediments and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from gypsiferous sandstone and shale.  McCarty soils are on pediments and small alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in this family.  Soils in similar families include the Brokenhorn, Grassytrail (T), Humbug, Hyshot, Jornaham and Odome series.  Brokenhorn and Hyshot soils have a fine particle-size class and smectitic mineralogy.  Grassytrail and Jornaham soils have a coarse-loamy particle size class and are very deep.  Humbug soils have gypsic mineralogy.  Odome soils have a typic aridic soil moisture regime.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous pedisediment and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale over gypsiferous residuum weathered from shale and sandstone
Landform:  pediments and small alluvial fans 
Slopes:  3 to 25 percent
Elevation:  1,585 to 2,073 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 10 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  23 to 31 cm
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months are July to October and driest months are December and June.
Frost-free period:  120 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Humbug, Mussentuchit, Rizno, Sinbad and Skos series. Humbug and Mussentuchit soils are on adjacent dissected structural benches and gypsiferous shale hills in treeless areas.  Rizno, Sinbad and Skos soils occur upslope of the McCarty soils.  The Rizno and Skos soils are shallow to sandstone bedrock and are on structural benches.  The Sinbad soils are shallow to shale and are on gypsiferous shale hills.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native plants are Mormon tea, shadscale, Indian ricegrass, Utah juniper, pinyon pine, blue grama and galleta.  Utah correlates this soil to Semidesert Gypsum (Juniper/Pinyon) R034BY208UT ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East central Utah, Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus; LRR D, MLRA 34B; small extent.  About 670 hectares (1,600 acres) mapped  in Emery County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 134 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  (Bky, 2Bky and 2BCy horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 13 cm.  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 27 to 51 cm.  (Bky horizon)
Gypsic horizon:  The zone from 51 to 109 cm.  (2Bky and 2BCy horizons)

Lithologic discontinuity:  The contact with gypsiferous shale residuum at 51 cm. (upper boundary of the 2Bky horizon) 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
