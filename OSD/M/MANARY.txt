MANARY SERIES

The Manary series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, frigid Aquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Manary silty clay loam, on a 2 percent slope in a plowed field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap-- 0 to 28 cm (11 inches); black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [25 to 30 cm (10 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bt--28 to 46 cm (11 to 18 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; firm; few fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; common coarse distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. [15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick]

 BC--46 to 74 cm (18 to 29 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silty clay; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium and fine angular blocky; firm; few fine prominent very pale brown (10YR 8/2) carbonate coatings on faces of peds; few fine distinct light olive gray (5Y 6/2) clay depletions on faces of peds; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common fine prominent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) iron depletions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 18 inches thick)

 C--74 to 203 cm (29 to 80 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) and reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay loam with thin 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) strata every 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 inches) of brown (7.5YR 5/4) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy very fine sand; massive with widely spaced vertical fractures; firm; stratification has weak medium platy structure; friable; common fine prominent pinkish white (5YR 8/2) carbonate coatings on faces of fractures; common fine prominent greenish gray (5GY 6/1) and light olive gray (5Y 6/2) clay depletions on faces of fractures; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Iosco County, Michigan; about 4 miles southwest of Sand Lake; 2000 feet west and 2250 feet south of the northeast corner of sec 21, T. 22 N., R. 6 E.; lat. 44 degrees 17 minutes 10 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 42 minutes 2 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Manary soils formed in stratified silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained or moderately well drained Nunica soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Hettinger soils. They are in a toposequence with Manary soils. The Nunica soils are on higher landscape position and the Hettinger are in lower areas. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (.5 to 1.5 feet) between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low to high depending upon slope gradient and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low. Permeability of these soils is moderately slow or slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use of this soil is agriculture, with the main crops being corn and small grains. Other areas are wooded.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northeastern lower Michigan. The series is of small extent.
