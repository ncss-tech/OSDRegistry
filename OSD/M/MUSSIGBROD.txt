MUSSIGBROD SERIES 

The Mussigbrod series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on remnant outwash terraces and alluvial fans in intermountain valleys.  These soils are on mima mounds.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

Silas - does not have horizon of carbonate accumulation; is moderately well drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - Remnant outwash terraces and alluvial fans
Elevation - 5,900 to 6,600 feet
Slope - 0 to 15 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

These are the Philipsburg and Briston soils. Philipsburg soils have an argillic and calcic horizon and are on alluvial fans. The Briston soils have an argillic horizon and lack a mollic epipedon and are on the same landform in the micro low position.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mussigbrod soils are used for rangeland grazing and as wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, basin wildrye, mountain big sagebrush, and other miscellaneous grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mussigbrod soils are not extensive in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana. MLRA 44.
