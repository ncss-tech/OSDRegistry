MONCISCO SERIES

The Moncisco series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone and in residuum derived from fractured porcelanite. Moncisco soils are on footslopes and backslopes of hills and have moderate permeability in the upper profile and very rapid permeability below. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over fragmental, mixed, active, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Moncisco extremely channery sandy clay loam -- on a convex backslope of a hill sloping 22 percent to the south at 5,760 feet elevation -- rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described, the soil was dry throughout.)

(1 to 5 inches thick)

     Bk -- 2 to 11 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) extremely channery sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak thick platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 70 percent channers, 5 percent gravel and 5 percent flagstones; violently effervescent, secondary calcium carbonates segregated as many fine and medium irregular shaped accumulations on rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.

(0 to 14 inches thick)

    2Cy -- 16 to 70 inches; red (10R 5/8) hard porcelanite fragments, red (10R 4/8) moist; highly fractured platy and angular rock structure; loose; few fine and very fine roots in cracks; vertical and horizontal interstices lack fine earth; 75 percent channers and 20 percent flagstones; secondary gypsum crystals segregated as very few fine and medium irregularly shaped accumulations on rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moncisco soils are on footslopes and backslopes of hills underlain by beds of fractured porcelanite. The porcelanite occurs as baked and fused shale and sandstone associated with burned coal seams of the Cretaceous Fruitland and Menefee Formations. Moncisco soils formed in eolian material derived from Cretaceous sandstone and residuum derived from fractured porcelanite. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,300 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chipeta, Huerfano, and Razito soils. Chipeta soils lack diagnostic horizons and are shallow to shale on footslopes below Moncisco soils. Huerfano soils have natric horizons and are shallow to shale on toeslopes and knolls of undulating plateaus. Razito soils are very deep and occur in stable linear dunes of undulating plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; rapid runoff; moderate permeability in the upper profile and very rapid permeability below.

USE AND VEGETATION: Moncisco soils are used for livestock grazing and as a source of road gravel. Present vegetation is galleta, alkali sacaton, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, shadscale, and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Moncisco soils are of small extent on the western San Juan Basin portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico.  MLRA 35, LRR-D
