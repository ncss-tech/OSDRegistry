MUSTY SERIES

The Musty series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that form in colluvium weathered from schist.  Musty soils are on ridges and hillslopes and have slopes of 12 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Humic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Musty gravelly loam, forested.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

O--1 inch to 0; partially decomposed needles and twigs.

A1--0 to 3 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly
loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); base saturation is 51 percent by ammonium acetate; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

A2--3 to 12 inches; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) gravelly
loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); base saturation is 34 percent by ammonium acetate; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 inches thick)

Bw--12 to 29 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) very cobbly
loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent cobbles and 30 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); base saturation is 54 percent by ammonium acetate; abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 19 inches thick)

R--29 inches; fractured schist.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Oregon; approximately 650 feet west and 1,350 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 13, T. 33 S., R. 3 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 or more consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 25 percent clay, 20 to 35 percent gravel and 15 to 35 percent cobbles.  It is moderately to strongly acid throughout.  It is 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 25 to 35 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles.  It is very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Coyata, Decy, Ovall and Tyson series.  Coyata soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Decy and Tyson soils are dry for over 90 consecutive days in the four months after the summer solstice.  Ovall soils have 10 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Musty series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridges and hillslopes.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from amphibolite schist.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.  Slopes range from 12 to 50 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Goolaway, Josephine, Speaker, Beekman, Pollard and Colestine soils.  Goolaway, Speaker and Colestine soils are fine-loamy.  Josephine and Pollard soils are deep and non-skeletal.  Beekman soils have an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.
USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production.  Native vegetation includes Douglas fir, sugar pine and ponderosa pine with an understory of chinkapin, cascade Oregongrape, vanilla leaf, princes pine, and twinflower.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
