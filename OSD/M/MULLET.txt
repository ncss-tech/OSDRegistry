Thin strata of finer material are found in some pedons which put some sites into a different taxonomic great group. 

COMPETING SERIES: Broadaxe is the only other competing series.
Broadaxe soils--are on submerged wave-cut platform landforms and often contain former preserved spodic fluviomarine soil horizons

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Sandy lagoonal deposits
Landscape--Coastal lagoons
Landform--Washover-fan flats and slopes
Slope--0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation--970 to 1570 millimeters (38 to 62 inches)
Mean annual air temperature--20 to 25 degrees C (69 to 77 degrees F)
Water salinity range--18 to 22 parts per thousand
Frost-free period--365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Endeavor, Ittsanapper, and Tea Hammock soils.
Endeavor soils--are on nearby relict flood-tidal delta landforms and often have enough shell fragments in the particle-size class to put them into a different taxonomic great group
Ittsanapper soils-are on lagoon bottom landforms, usually at deeper water depths, and have thicker finer textured materials
Tea Hammock soils--are also on nearby anthropogenic landforms consisting of dredge shoal deposits

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish harvesting; benthic species include tubeworms, clams, crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish 
Native vegetation-- Dominant vegetation is driven by water quality and quantity within subaqueous systems. Under excellent water quality these soils support seagrass species including but not limited to shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), manatee grass (Syringodium filiforme), and star grass (Halophila engelmannii). Shallower areas may support widgeongrass (Ruppia maritima). Under degraded / poor water quality seagrass may be replaced by rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families. Caulerpa prolifera (Chlorophyta) is often dominant. Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 80 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the coasts of Indian River Lagoon, Florida
Land Resource Regions--U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop, and Range Region
MLRA(s)--155
Extent--Small
