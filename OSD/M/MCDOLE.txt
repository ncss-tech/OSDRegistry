MCDOLE SERIES

The McDole series consists of very deep, well drained soil that formed in silty alluvium derived dominantly from loess. Permeability is moderate. These soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. The average annual precipitation is 12 inches and the average annual temperature is 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Torrifluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  McDole silt loam, pasture. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine platy structure parting to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to inches thick)

    A--5 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few worm channels and casts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--10 to 17 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; few worm channels and casts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick)

    Ck2--17 to 41 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; very few 3/4 inch hard cicada krotovinas; few lime veins and spots of lime in the lower 5 inches; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 25 inches thick)

    Ck3--41 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few roots; many very fine tubular pores; few lime veins; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 30 inches thick)

    2C4--60 to 70 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; few fine faint mottles; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5). (0 to 20 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Equatzel series. Equatzel soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 12 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McDole soils are on terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. They formed in silty alluvium derived dominantly from loess. The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,200 feet. Some areas receive runoff water from adjacent areas.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Declo, Neeley, Paniogue, Parehat, Penoyer, Pocatello, Tickason, and Wheeler soils.  Declo soils lack mollic epipedons and are coarse-loamy. Neeley soils have a calcic horizon at a depth of less than 20 inches. Paniogue soils lack mollic epipedons and have sand and gravel at moderate depths.  Parehat soils are fine-silty and somewhat poorly drained. Penoyer, Pocatello and Wheeler soils lack mollic epipedons. Tickason soils are coarse-loamy and have calcic horizons. Declo, Paniogue and Tickason soils are on higher, older stream terraces. Neeley and Pocatello soils are on loess-covered fan terraces. Wheeler soils are on eroded south slopes of fan terraces and foothills. Parehat soils are in concave, less well-drained positions on stream terraces. Penoyer soils are on convex areas on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This McDole soils is used mainly for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland. The potential natural vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, and Wyoming big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho. The series is inextensive.
