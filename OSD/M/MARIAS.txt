MARIAS SERIES

The Marias series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or glaciolacustrine or lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, lake plains, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Haplusterts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Marias clay, in cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong very fine granules structure; hard, friable, sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; after a rain a thin weak crust consisting of adhering soil granules forms on the soil surface; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 11 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) organic coatings on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Bss--11 to 27 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common slickensides with intersecting surfaces 20 to 40 degrees from horizontal; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick)

    Bssy--27 to 60 inches, gray (5Y 5/1) clay, very dark gray (5Y 3/1) moist; moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine granular; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; thick slickensides on faces of prisms; many large (1 inch diameter) masses and threads of gypsum crystals; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

Slope - 0 to 15 percent.

Parent material - calcareous alluvium or glaciolacustrine or lacustrine deposits.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls in the spring and early part of summer.
