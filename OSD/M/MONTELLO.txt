MONTELLO SERIES

The Montello series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in fine-textured lacustrine deposits on basins of glacial lakes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Montello silt loam - on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 250 meters (850 feet) above mean sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

	A--20 to 31 cm (8 to 12 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium platy structure in the upper part and weak medium subangular blocky structure in the lower 5cm (2 inches); friable; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  [Combined thickness of the A and Ap horizons ranges from 23 to 38 cm (9 to 15 inches).]

	Bt1--31 to 41 cm (12 to 16 inches);  brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

	Bt2--41 to 53 cm (16 to 21 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) and dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) silty clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) clay films on faces of peds; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

	Bt3--53 to 66 cm (21 to 26 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) clay films on faces of most peds; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron near the lower boundary; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches).]

	BC--66 to 91 cm (26 to 36 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

	C--91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay loam; massive; firm; common soft lime segregations; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Marquette County, Wisconsin; about 2 miles southeast of Oxford; 1950 feet east and 530 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 28, T. 15 N.,R. 8 E. USGS Oxford, Wisconsin Quadrangle; Latitude - 43 degrees 45 minutes 30 seconds N. Longitude ? 89 degrees 33 minutes 16 seconds W. NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the base of soil development: 61 to 107 cm (24 to 42 inches)
Carbonates: typically in the BC and C horizons, but some pedons do not have carbonates in the BC horizon. 
Particle-size control section: averages 35 and 45 percent clay, 2 to 10 percent fine sand or coarser
Rock fragments: absent throughout soil profile
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum, neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part; slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the substratum
Redox accumulatons and saturation: within 102 cm (40 inches)

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: silt loam or loam

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: silty clay loam or silty clay  

BC horizon: 
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: dominantly silty clay loam, but in some pedons there are thin strata of silt loam, fine sandy loam or loam.

C horizon: 
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: dominantly silty clay loam, but in some pedons there are thin strata of silt loam, fine sandy loam or loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   The Montello soils are on basins of glacial lakes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in reddish, calcareous, lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 890 mm (25 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 (46 to 50 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are mainly the Briggsville and Mundelein soils.  Briggsville soils are next to the Montello soils on similar slopes, but have thinner, lighter-colored surface layers.  In nearby lower areas are the somewhat poorly drained Mundelein soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) for one month or more per year for 6 or more out of 10 years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for copland. Common crops are corn, small grain, canning crops and forages. Native vegetation is mainly prairie grasses, forbs, and scattered trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 95B in Marquette County in south-central Wisconsin.  Montello soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Marquette County, Wisconsin, 1969.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon -  0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (Ap, A); argillic horizon -  31 to 64 cm (12 to 25 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3). 

- The location for the typical pedon site in this OSD does not match the location given for the same pedon (TUD) in the published survey. Both descriptions say the site is 50 feet west of the road. The location given in this OSD is 250 to 300 feet east of the road. The original location given in the TUD says NW1/4 NW1/4 sec. 28, T. 15 N., R. 8 E.; 50 feet west of Town Road A and 3/5 mile south of the intersection of Town Roads A and D. There is no Montello mapped in this 40 acres and it is more than 50 feet west of Town Road A. However, if this location is changed to NE1/4, NW1/4 sec. 28, T. 15 N., R. 8 E.; 50 feet west of Town Road A and 3/5 mile south of the intersection of Town Roads A and D, the site falls in a map unit of MsA, Montello silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. This location has been used.
