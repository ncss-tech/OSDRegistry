MERCERCAVE SERIES

The Mercercave series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from marble. The Mercercave soils are on shoulders and backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 955 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mercercave soils are on shoulders and backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from marble. Elevation is 535 to 775 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 875 to 1090 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 14 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 220 to 260 days.               

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Tiger Creek, Nedsgulch, Beybek, and Aquariusmine soils. The Tiger Creek and Nedsgulch soils are fine-loamy. Tiger Creek typically occupies lower hillslope positions and interfluve areas. Nedsgulch soils develop from schist, phyllite, and other similar metasedimentary rocks. Beybek and Aquariusmine soils are thermic and occupy lower elevations and warm aspects. Beybek soils are moderately deep to lithic contact and Aquariusmine soils are fine-loamy. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately low to high saturated hydraulic conductivity in the control section. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is low to very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is intermixed conifers and hardwoods. Tree species include black oak, live oak, and ponderosa pine. Understory composition is primarily native shrubs with few grasses and forbs. Understory species include poison oak, toyon, buckthorn, and manzanita. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22. This series is not extensive.
