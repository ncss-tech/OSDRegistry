MITOTES SERIES

The Mitotes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  Mitotes soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mitotes sandy loam, on a southeast facing, convex, 33 percent slope in mixed conifers at an elevation of 10,200 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on June 6, 1986 the soil was moist from 0 to 60 inches.  The surface is covered by 1 percent stones.

    Oe--0 to 1 inches; moderately decomposed organic litter.  

    E--1 to 15 inches; pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine, medium and few coarse roots; 10 percent gravel, 1 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    E/B--15 to 21 inches; 65 percent pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) cobbly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist, and 35 percent light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) cobbly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; 10 percent gravel, 7 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--21 to 32 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) cobbly sandy clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common patchy clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bt2--32 to 51 inches; weak red (2.5YR 5/2) cobbly clay loam, weak red (2.5YR 4/2) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common patchy clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 25 to 34 inches)

    2C--51 to 72 inches; weak red (2.5YR 5/2) stony sandy loam, weak red (2.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, 2007, Las Animas Area soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is from a canyon in the area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 21 to 41 inches.  (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizons)
Albic horizon:  The zone from 1 to 15 inches.  (E horizon)
Glossic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 21 inches.  (E/B horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 21 at 51 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2C horizon. 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
