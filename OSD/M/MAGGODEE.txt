SERIES ESTABLISHED: Franklin County, Virginia, 2004

REMARKS:  Maggodee soils were formerly recognized in the Comus series. Addition of Oxyaquic subgroup places these soils in a different subgroup from the Comus series. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (Ap horizons)
Cambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 48 inches (Bw, Bg, and BCg horizons)
Oxyaquic feature - indications of saturation by accumulations and depletions at 13 inches (Bw1 horizon)
