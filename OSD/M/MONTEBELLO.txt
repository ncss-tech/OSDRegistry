MONTEBELLO SERIES


The Montebello series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in human transported materials (HTM) on graded alluvial fans that originate from granitic sources. Slopes range from nearly level to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 445 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, spolic, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Typic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Montebello silt loam, on a graded alluvial fan remnant. When described the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 ^A--0 to 9 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular and moderate thin platy structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 55 cm thick)

 ^C--9 to 87 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist, 10 percent strong brown(7.5YR 4/6) and 5 percent brown (10YR 5/3); massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; few very fine interstitial pores; mixed matrix color; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (67 to 195 cm thick)

 2Bt1--87 to 135 cm; clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common distinct clay films on surfaces along root channels; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8; clear wavy).

 2Bt2--135 to 200 cm; clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). (Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizons is 0 to 125 cm thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Los Angeles County, CA, Northeast corner of Mills Park on Wheeler Road in La Verne, CA. 34 degrees, 8 minutes, 5 seconds North latitude and 117 degrees, 46 minutes, 30 seconds West longitude, NAD83 - U.S.G.S Quad: Glendora.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: The soil becomes moist below a depth of about 30 cm some time from October to December and remains moist in some part between a depth of about 30 to 90 cm until April or May. It is dry the rest of the year.
Mean Annual Soil Temperature: 17 to 20 degrees C. The soil temperature usually does not go below 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: alluvial plain, coastal plain.
Landform: locally raised land, cut and filled terraces on existing alluvial fan remnants.
Parent material: human transported materials originating from and/or overlying old weathered alluvium from granitic sources.
Elevation: 10 to 625 meters.
Slope: 0 to 15 percent.
Mean January temperature: 13 degrees C.
Mean July temperature: 24 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: 320 to 650 mm.
Mean annual air temperature: 16 to 19 degrees C.
Frost free season: 300 to 365 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Botella, Cropley, Palmview, Pierview, Ramona, and Tujunga soils.
Botella soils: have an argillic horizons with a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions.
Counterfeit soils: have greater than 35 percent clay and are on graded hillsides.
Cropley soils: have cracks at the surface during the summer and are on floodplains.
Gorgonio soils: have a sandy textures with a mollic epipedon and are on young alluvial fans.
Palmview soils: have less than 18 percent clay and are on young alluvial fans.  
Pierview soils: have an argillic horizon that extends below a depth of 150 cm and are on fan remnants from sedimentary sources.
Ramona soils: have an argillic horizon and are on fan remnants and terraces.
Sepulveda soils: have calcium carbonates throughout and are formed in human transported materials that originate from alluvium from sedimentary sources.
Tujunga soils: have sandy textures and are on alluvial fans and floodplains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low to high runoff; moderate to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Montebello soils are used for urban residential development and commercial areas. Vegetation is primarily maintained lawns, ornamental trees and shrubs.
