MULHALL SERIES

The Mulhall series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and are underlain with silty shale of Permian age.  These soils are on backslopes and footslopes of low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 840 mm (33 in).  Mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).
