MORAPOS SERIES

The Morapos series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from shale and siltstone, with admixture of loess in some pedons. Morapos soils are on structural benches, hills, plateaus, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees for 170 to 190 days.
Soil moisture: Ustic moisture regime (typic ustic subclass). The moisture control section in most years is moist in all parts for 30 to 45 consecutive days in May and June, and dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days immediately after July 15, and moist in some but not all parts for most of the period from September 1 through March 30. It is not dry in all parts for more than half the time that the soil temperature is higher than 41 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches.

Barela, Capillo, and Tukuhnik soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches
Delson, Herm, and Moreno soils are noncalcareous.
Ekah soils have a calcic horizon.
Ricot soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the profile. 
Tamaneen soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part that is loamy with greater than 50 percent rock fragments.
Work soils are moist in some or all parts during June and July and parts of August.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Morapos soils are on structural benches, hills, plateaus, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The soil formed in slope alluvium and residuum from shale and siltstone, with admixture of loess in some pedons. Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year except for a slight decline in July. Over half of the precipitation is received as snow. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 67 degrees F. The frost free season is 65 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pagoda, Hesperus, Herm, Iles, and Campspass series. Pagoda and Hesperus soils have mollic epipedons which are 16 or more inches thick. Herm soils are noncalcareous. Iles and Campspass soils do not have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for rangeland. Some are used for dryland wheat and alfalfa. Principal native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Saskatoon serviceberry, Letterman's needlegrass, slender wheatgrass, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Colorado. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Moffat County (Moffat County Area), Colorado, 1991. The name is taken from Morapos Creek which is near the type location.

REMARKS: Climatic conditions are close to fitting that of the xeric moisture regime. Snow cover occurs in October before the moisture control section becomes moistened in all parts; hence it has no opportunity to be moist in all parts for 3 of the 4 months after the winter solstice. Snow melt occurs in mid-April to mid-May and moistens the control section and below. Increased evapotranspiration dries out the control section by mid-July. Summer precipitation comes as irregular showers which are not sufficient to moisten the soil down to the top of the control section. As evapotranspiration decreases in late September, the showers moisten the soil down into the top part of the moisture control section.

The 10/2002 revision restricts the series characteristics to northwestern Colorado, where it was proposed and established. It will not be correlated in southwestern Colorado in the future. This change mainly affected the climatic setting and the vegetation.

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches.
Argillic horizon - from 5 to 23 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 5 to 23 inches (the entire argillic horizon).
