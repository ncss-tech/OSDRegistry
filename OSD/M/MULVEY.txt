MULVEY SERIES

The Mulvey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep or very deep to gravelly outwash. Mulvey soils formed in loess and loamy sediments and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Udollic Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Mulvey silt loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bt1--23 to 33 cm (9 to 13 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Bt2--33 to 74 cm (13 to 29 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 38 to 84 cm (15 to 33 inches).]

 2Bt3--74 to 104 cm (29 to 41 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) clay loam; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; 5 percent fine gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [25 to 63 cm (10 to 25 inches) thick]

 3Bt4--104 to 132 cm (41 to 52 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) gravelly sandy clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; 25 percent fine gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 3Btg--132 to 168 cm (52 to 66 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; distinct gray (10YR 5/1) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 20 percent fine gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the 3Bt horizon is 13 to 76 cm (5 to 30 inches).]

 4Cg--168 to 203 cm (66 to 80 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Atterberry, Bethalto, Canoe, Curran, Emery, Franklin, Koszta, Millbrook, Virgil, and Wauconda series. All of these soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mulvey soils are on slight rises on outwash plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mulvey soils formed in loess and loamy sediments and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bowes and Mahalasville soils. The well drained Bowes soils are on higher lying rises in the landform. The very poorly drained Mahalasville soils are in depressions. Where mapped in association with Mulvey soils, Mahalasville soils have gravelly substrata.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. In undisturbed areas, depth to the top of an apparent high water table ranges from 0 to 46 cm (0 to 1.5 feet) at some time in normal years. Where artificially drained it is at a depth ranging from 30 to 91 cm (1 to 3 feet) at some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the subsoil and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and very rapid in the underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, and small grain. A few areas are used for hay or pasture. Native vegetation is prairie grasses and scattered trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111D in west-central Indiana. The series is of small extent.
