MENTZEL SERIES

The Mentzel series consists of very deep, poorly drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity (rapidly permeable) soils that formed in eolian deposits. These nearly level soils occur on tidal flats on barrier islands. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1245 mm (49 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, hyperthermic Sodic Psammaquents

Major uses: wildlife habitat
Native vegetation: these areas do not have vegetation and some areas have an algal mat

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES PROPOSED: Galveston County, Texas, 2020. The name is from a cove near the type location.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Mustang series. The series was separated based on differences in water table depth, salinity, and vegetation.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
  Particle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) 
  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A horizon) 
  Endosaturation and aquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) (A, C1, C2, C3, Cg1, Cg2, and Cg3 horizons)

Additional Comments: Sodic classification is based on similar soils and landform.
