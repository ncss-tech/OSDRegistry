MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Chatham County, North Carolina, 2005 

REMARKS: Moncure soils were previously mapped as Roanoke soils. Roanoke soils have a fine particle size family. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 4 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 12 to 41 inches (Btg horizons)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Reference particle-size data is available from the project soil survey staff, Pittsboro, North Carolina.
