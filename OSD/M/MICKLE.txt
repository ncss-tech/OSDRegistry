MICKLE SERIES

The Mickle series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty slope alluvium. These soils are on headslopes of hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Mickle silt loam on a concave, southwest-facing slope of 7 percent, in a cultivated field, at elevation of 351 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 30 centimeters; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots; about 2 percent chert channers; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (25 to 49 centimeters thick)

    BE--30 to 46 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; about 2 percent chert channers; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

    Bt1--46 to 69 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and many fine roots; common faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; about 1 percent chert channers; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--69 to 109 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; many faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; about 1 percent chert channers; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

    Bt3--109 to 140 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; common faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; about 3 percent dolostone channers; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt4--140 to 165 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; common coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation and few faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; few faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on the faces of peds and in pores; about 5 percent dolostone and sandstone channers; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    BC--165 to 203 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; friable; many very coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation and common fine light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; about 7 percent dolostone and sandstone channers; slightly acid.
