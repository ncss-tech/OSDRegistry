MCARTHUR SERIES

The McArthur series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, escarpments and breaklands.  They formed in material weathered from schist, gneiss, and granite bedrock with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slope ranges from 35 to 85 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McArthur soils are on south and west-facing mountain slopes and breaklands.  Slopes range from 35 to 85 percent.  They formed in residuum derived from schist, gneiss, and granite bedrock with minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface layers.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 4,800 feet.  The average annual air temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches.  The average frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Highfalls (T), Idamont, Katka (T), Pearsoncreek (T), Jaypeak (T), and Treble series.  Highfalls soils are on mountains and foothills and formed in glacial till and are ashy over loamy-skeletal.  Idamont soils are on mountains and foothills and formed in glacial till and are ashy over loamy.  Katka soils are on south-facing mountain slopes at higher elevations and are cryic.  Pearsoncreek and Treble soils are on mountains and foothills and formed in glacial till and do not have an umbric epipedon.  Jaypeak soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and are ashy over loamy-skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid to very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine with an understory of Saskatoon serviceberry, pine reedgrass, mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, common snowberry, low Oregongrape, myrtle pachystima, white spirea, Rocky Mountain maple, baldhip rose, Columbia brome, strawberry, and starry false Solomons seal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana and northeastern Washington.  This series is not extensive

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Boundary County, Idaho, 2002.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Umbric epipedon - the zone from 2 to 9 inches (A and AB horizons)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 17 inches (Bw horizon)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bw, the C1, and part of the C2 horizon)

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.

The 11/2010 revision reflects a reclassification from Dystroxerepts to Humixerepts greatgroup based on revisions to the 11th Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy. No other changes were made during this revision.
