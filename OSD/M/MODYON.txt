MODYON SERIES

The Modyon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt and local alluvium, on gently sloping fans.  Average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Modyon cobbly loam - rangeland. (Colors are dry unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 3 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and non plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

     B--3 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular block structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; 25 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

     Bk1--16 to 24 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 20 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

     Bk2--24 to 28 inches; white (10YR 8/1) very cobbly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, friable, slightly sticky and non plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 20 percent cobbles, 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); (4 to 20 inches thick)

     R--28 inches; basalt

COMPETING SERIES:  The competing series are Ayon (NM), Curabith (CO), Hogadero (NM), Hubert (AZ), Mextank (AZ) and Pena (NM).  All these soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Modyon soils are on gently sloping fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  Elevation is 6,800 to 7,900 feet.  Average annual air temperature 47 to 54 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Frost-free season is 115 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Cabezon, Motoqua, Hickman, Thunderbird, and Catron.  Cabezon and Motoqua have a lithic contact within 20 inches Thunderbird have argillic horizons.  Hickman and Catron lack calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as rangeland. Principle native vegetation is blue Grama, western Wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, spike muhly, New Mexico feathergrass and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Westcentral New Mexico.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
