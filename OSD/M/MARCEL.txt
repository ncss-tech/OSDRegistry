MARCEL SERIES 

The Marcel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alpine glacial till or alluvium from hard fine grained igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, structural benches, and on sides of hills and ridges in mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Marcel gravelly loam, bouldery, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--2 inches to 0; decomposed leaves and roots. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. 

    A2--2 to 9 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure;  slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles, 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    A3--9 to 18 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent cobbles, 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 16 to 26 inches.) 

    Bt1--18 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent cobbles, 40 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual irregular boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bt2--24 to 42 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; few faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations;  moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual irregular boundary. 

    Bt3--42 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; common distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; moderate coarse prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 35 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6). (Combined thickness of Bt2 and Bt3 horizons is 15 to 36 inches.)
