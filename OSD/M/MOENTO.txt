MOENTO SERIES

The Moento series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and landslide deposits over residuum derived from sandstone. These soils are on dip slopes, structural benches, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Detra, Jemco, and Fughes series.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Moento soils are used mainly for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Native vegetation is mainly Arizona fescue, prairie Junegrass, mountain muhly, needle and thread, elk sedge, Gambel oak and ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Moento soils are of moderate extent in southwestern Colorado. MLRA 48A.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Animas-Dolores Area, Colorado, Parts of Archuleta, Dolores, Hinsdale, La Plata, Montezuma, San Juan, and San Miguel Counties, 2002.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 30 cm (A1, A2, and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon - from 30 to 76 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Lithic contact - at 76 cm
Particle-size control section - from 30 to 76 cm. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Moento soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime.

Note: In this pedon it is assumed the A1 horizon displays the greatest amount of eluviation and that the clay increase, required for a diagnostic argillic horizon, is measured from the A1 horizon to the Bt1 horizon.
