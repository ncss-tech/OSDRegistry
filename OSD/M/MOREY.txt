MOREY SERIES

The Morey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained very slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.5 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).

Algoa and Mocarey soils: fine-loamy particle-size control section; a calcic horizon.
Bernard soils: fine particle-size control section; in areas of less rainfall
Viterbo soils: have a ochric epipedon; more acidic throughout

Landscape: flat coastal plains
Landform: flats
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 20.0 to 22.2 degrees C (68 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1575 mm (48 to 62 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the fall and spring months.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aris, Anahuac, Labelle, Levac, Orcadia, Meaton, and the Spindletop series.

Aris soils: are gray throughout due to wetness; are on flats
Anahuac  and Orcadia soils: are on a broader landform
Labelle soils: somewhat poorly drained; on flats
Levac soils: somewhat poorly drained; are truncated pimple mounds
Meaton soils: are rarely flooded due to storm surge
Spindletop soils: are in a fine family; are on pimple mounds

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is very low. Runoff is high. These soils remain saturated from 12 to 113 cm (5 to 44 in) from the soil surface from January to March in normal years and from 130 to 203 cm (51 to 80 in)

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for pasture or rice production.  Improved pastures are mostly in bahiagrass.  Native grasses are mainly little bluestem, indiangrass, brownseed paspalum, eastern gamagrass, big bluestem, Florida paspalum, and switchgrass. In some areas pine and hardwood trees have encroached. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Gulf Coast Prairie Prairie of Texas; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A; large extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Texas; 1963

REMARKS: The series was updated during the correlation of the update of MLRA 150A in 2013. The series is no longer correlated in Louisiana as was noted in previous versions of the series description.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 13 to 63 cm (5 to 25 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons) 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 66 cm (0 to 26 in) (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon: 13 to 203 cm (5 to 81 in) Bt1, Bt2, Bt3,Bt4, Btk1, Btk2, Btkg horizons)

Additional Comments:  Mineralogy changed from mixed to siliceous 12/95 based on data from TAMU. Aquic conditions do not occur in the upper part when these soils are saturated.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  KSSL data Jefferson Co. Tex. (S88-TX-245-003).
