MIDO SERIES

The Mido series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived mainly from sandstone. Mido soils are on mesas, benches, plateaus, stabilized dunes, hills, sand sheets, dunes on structural benches, and in broad valleys. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Mido loamy fine sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 2 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, very friable; very few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; slightly calcareous, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 11 inches thick)

 C--2 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loamy fine sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; moderately calcareous, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION: Wayne County, Utah; about 18 miles northeast of Hanksville, and about 1,500 feet east and 500 feet south of the northwest corner of sec. 4, T. 27 S., R. 14 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soils are usually dry 40 to 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. but are moist for 30 to 40 days in some part of the moisture control section during September and October. Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 57 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature: 65 to 70 degrees F.

Reaction:  neutral to strongly alkaline

Particle-size control section: commonly slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous. Some pedons are noncalcareous to a depth of 17 inches.

A horizon

C horizon
Hue: 5YR, 2.5YR

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Calladito (NM), Curtis Siding (WY), Dwyer (WY), Karval (CO), Orpha (WY), Pensom (AZ), Pinavettes (NM), Tullock (WY), Valent (CO), and Wigton (CO) series. Dwyer, Karval, Orpha, Tullock, Valent, and Wigton soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Calladito and Pinavettes soils have hues 7.5YR or yellower. Pensom soils are deep to bedrock. Curtis Siding soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mido soils are on mesas, benches, plateaus, stabilized dunes, hills, sand sheets, broad valleys and dunes on structural benches. They formed in eolian deposits or alluvium from sandstone. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Elevations are 3,500 to  7,010 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Begay, Newsrock, and Redbank soils. Begay and Redbank soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Newsrock soils have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; negligible to medium runoff; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is sand sagebrush, Mormon-tea, Indian ricegrass, galleta, blue grama and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Utah and Northern Arizona. The series is of moderate extent. MLRA is 35.
