COMPETING SERIES: These are Cohoe, Kenai, Naptowne, and Whitsol series. Cohoe soils have a weighted average of less than 15 percent fine sands and coarser in the particle size control section. Kenai soils have more 18 percent clay in the loamy part of the control section. Naptowne soils have less than 6 percent total carbon in the spodic horizon. Whitsol soils have stratified substratums.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over loamy glacial till
Landform: moraines on till plains
Slopes: 0 to 60 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 37 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 30 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Kachemak, Qutal, Redoubt, Spenard, and Starichkof soils. Kachemak are lack albic horizons and occur on similar and landscapes. Qutal soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on discharge slopes. Redoubt soils have greater than 6 percent organic carbon in the spodic horizon and occur on similar landscapes. Spenard and Starichkof soils have aquic moisture regimes and occur on depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high is the solum and moderately high or high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: The Mutnala soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and residential development. The native vegetation is dominantly Sitka spruce and white spruce with an understory of Sitka alder, rusty menziesia, wood fern, and clubmoss. Some areas have been cleared and are used for vegetable crops and hay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowland, South-central Alaska.  The series is of moderate extent.
