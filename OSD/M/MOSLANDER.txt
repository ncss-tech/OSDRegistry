MOSLANDER SERIES

The Moslander series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, valley fill, and marshes.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent and slightly concave.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous Typic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Moslander loam-wet meadow.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      Oi--0 to 3 cm; dense, fibrous mat of roots.

      A--3 to 23 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent when dry, calcium carbonate disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 cm thick)

      Bg--23 to 43 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; common fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; slightly effervescent when dry, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

      BCg--43 to 68 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; common fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations; very weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium roots; strongly effervescent when dry, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick).

      Cg1--68 to 83 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; common fine prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent when dry, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 64 cm thick)

      Cg2--83 to 154 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; many medium prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations; massive; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent when dry, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Natrona County, Wyoming; about 565 meters east and 440 meters south of the northwest corner of sec. 23, T. 39 N., R. 87 W.  It is about 65 meters southeast of an old, abandoned trapper's cabin 25 meters south of the trail. USGS Badwater SE quadrangle, lat. 43 degrees 20 minutes 23 seconds N and long. 107 degrees 15 minutes 11 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature--4 to 6 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature--10 to 12 degrees C
Thickness of mollic epipedon--18 to 48 cm
These soils are typically calcareous throughout when dry but are free of carbonates as deep as 25 cm in some pedons.  
This soil has a water table within 50 cm of the surface during most of the year.

Particle-size control section:
Texture--loam or clay loam
Clay content--18 to 35 percent clay
Sand content--20 to 55 percent sand, with less than 35 percent but more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  Thin strata of varying textures are common in some pedons but when averaged meet the criteria above.
Rock fragment content--0 to 15 percent rounded gravel above a depth of 100 cm
Exchangeable sodium content--0 to 15 percent

A horizon
Hue--5Y through 10YR
Value--3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma--N through 2
Electrical conductivity--0 to 4 mmhos/cm
Reaction--pH 7.4 to 8.4

Bg horizon
Hue--5Y through 10YR
Value--3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist
Chroma--N through 2
Electrical conductivity--0 to 4 mmhos/cm
High chroma redox concentrations are common in this horizon.
Reaction--pH 7.4 to 9.0

Cg horizon
Hue--5Y through 10YR
Value--4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma--N through 2
Electrical conductivity--2 to 8 mmhos/cm
Salt accumulations are present in some pedons.
High chroma redox concentrations are common.
Reaction--pH 7.9 to 9.0

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Tonks series which has a horizon of secondary carbonate accumulations above 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform--stream terraces, valley fill, and marshes in high mountain areas
Elevation--2000 to 2625 meters
Slope--0 to 3 percent
Parent material--alluvium from mixed sources
Mean annual precipitation--360 to 480 mm
Mean annual air temperature--2 to 6 degrees C
Frost-free period--50 to 80 days, but light frost may occur during any month

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow or medium runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland, hay meadow, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of sedges, northern reedgrass, tufted hairgrass, willow, and baltic rush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Moslander soils are of small extent in the high mountain valleys of central and southwestern Wyoming; MLRAs 43B and 46.
