MONTVALE SERIES

The Montvale series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Montvale soils occur on gently sloping to hilly uplands and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degree F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Montvale very stony very fine sandy loam, woodland-range.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very stony very fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak thick platy structure that parts to weak very fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; 30 percent stones and cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    B--3 to 7 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very stony very fine sandy loan, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) dry; weak thick platy structure that parts to weak medium angular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; few fine pores; 25 percent stones and cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt--7 to 13 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very stony loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure that parts to weak subangular blocky; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many fine pores; few thin clay films in channels; 25 percent stones and cobbles and 15 percent pebbles; noncalcareous; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk--13 to 18 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very stony loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; few thin clay films in channels; 30 percent stones and cobbles and 10 percent pebbles; strongly calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    R--18 inches; sandstone, partially decomposed and fractured, grading into consolidated hardrock.

TYPE LOCATION: San Juan County, Utah; Summit Point area; about 0.4 miles west of the SE corner of section 9, T.33S., R.26E., SLBM.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 7 to 19 inches 

Depth to bedrock: 7 to 19 inches.

Depth to the carbonate accumulation: 6 to 14 inches

Rock fragments: dominantly angular stones and cobbles, but some are gravel

Rock fragments: 25 to 50 percent in individual horizons, but average 35 percent or more by volume in the series control section

Mean annual soil temperature: 48 to 52 degrees F. at a depth immediately above the bedrock

Soil moisture: Aridic ustic moisture regime.

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 3.5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 3.5 dry, 2 through 4 moist. After mixing, the moist chroma is 2 or 3 to a depth of 7 or more inches
Texture: very stony very fine sandy loam or very stony loam.

Bt horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: very stony loan, but ranges to very stony light sandy clay loan.

Bk horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: very stony loam, but ranges to very stony very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Calcium carbonate: moderately or strongly calcareous
Organic matter: Typically an accumulation of organic matter occurs just above the bedrock. Commonly the Btk horizon is higher in organic matter than either the Al or B2t horizons.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckspring (NV), Motoqua (UT), Santa Fe (NM), and Slidymtn (NV) soils.  Buckspring soils have hue of 10YR. Motoqua, Santa Fe, and Slidymtn soils lack horizons of carbonate accumulation. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Montvale soils are on ridges, uplands and plains at elevations of 5,800 to 7,500 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from sandstone. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 58 to 70 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches. The frost-free season is 105 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Monticello and Northdale soils. Monticello soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Northdale soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for woodland, range and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is dominantly black sagebrush, big sagebrush, pinyon, juniper, snakeweed, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Colorado plateau of southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado. MLRAs 35, 39 & 48A. These soils are extensive.
