MOKAAC SERIES

The Mokaac series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary formations high in gypsum and calcium carbonate.  Mokaac soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, gypsic, thermic Typic Calcigypsids

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mokaac soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary formations high in gypsum and calcium carbonate.  Elevation ranges from 1600 to 4500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Akinville, Gypill and Ruesh series.  Gypill soils have a lithic contact at depths less than 20 inches.  Ruesh soils are coarse-loamy.  Akinville soils are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained;  slow to rapid runoff; rapid permeability.  Flooding is none to rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mokaac soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is creosotebush, gyp dropseed, big galleta and fluffgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  The series is of small extent.  MLRA is 30.
