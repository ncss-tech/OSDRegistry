MIDENT SERIES

The Mident series are very shallow to shallow over soft Entrada formation sandstone, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, eolian sand and sandstone residuum derived from the Entrada formation. Mident soils are on hillslopes on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic, shallow Ustic Torripsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Mident fine sand, 19 percent slope at an elevation of 5,600 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by trace gravel.

       A--0 to 3 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) fine sand, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3), moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

       C--3 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) fine sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3), moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

       Cr--10 inches; soft Entrada formation sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Garfield County, Utah; Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, about 1 mile east of Cedar Wash Arch; located about 1,700 feet north and 2,400 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 24, T. 36 S., R. 3 E.; Dave Canyon USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 39 minutes 37.93 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees 31 minutes 31.35 seconds W, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Ustic aridic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 54 degrees F 

Depth to paralithic contact: 4 to 20 inches to soft Entrada formation sandstone 

Particle-size control section (weighted average): 

Clay content: 1 to 5 percent

Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravel 

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 6 or 7 moist 
Chroma: 3 or 4 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent 
Effervescence: slightly to strongly effervescent 

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 5 to 7 moist 
Chroma: 3 or 4 
Texture: fine sand or loamy fine sand 
Clay content: 1 to 5 percent 
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent eolian recharged lime accumulation 
Effervescence: slightly to strongly effervescent 

Cr horizon 
Other features:  Soft Entrada formation sandstone can be dug with minor difficulty with a spade.  Depth to hard bedrock Entrada formation sandstone range from 20 to 30 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: alluvium, eolian sand and sandstone residuum derived from the Entrada formation 
Landform: hillslopes on structural bench 
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent 
Elevation: 5,200 to 6,100 feet 
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 52 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation: 9 to 12 inches 
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arches and Yarts series. The Arches soils have a lithic contact before 20 inches. The Yarts soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained, medium to high runoff, rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Potential vegetation is Utah juniper, roundleaf buffaloberry, broom snakeweed, Bigelow sagebrush, cliffrose, two-needle pinyon, Indian ricegrass, and galleta. These soils have been correlated to the Semidesert Shallow Sand (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) 035XY227UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central, Utah; MLRA 35; This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Garfield County, Utah, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument soil survey area; 2004. The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 3 inches. (A horizon) 

Paralithic contact: The contact with soft Entrada sandstone at 10 inches. (Cr horizon) 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
