USE AND VEGETATION:
Mostly woodland. Native vegetation is pin oak, white oak, willow oak, red maple, bay magnolia, sweet gum, black gum, and black birch. When drained, these soils are used for truck crops, blueberries and pasture.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ocean County, New Jersey, 1978 

REMARKS: These soils have been correlated in the past as mesic taxadjuncts of Pocomoke series. In addition to being outside the temperature range of the Pocomoke series, Mullica soils do not have argillic horizons; although in some places there are a few thin clay films on peds or bridging between sand grains in the Bg horizons. Many areas have finer textured strata within the solum. 

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon--the zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ag horizon)
Albic horizon--the zone from 33 to 53 cm (Eg horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 53 to 79 cm (Bg horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 200 cm is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
