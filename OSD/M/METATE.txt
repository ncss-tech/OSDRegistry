METATE SERIES

The Metate series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff and dacite. Metate soils are on flood plain steps of valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Metate soils are on flood plain steps of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation and dacite of the Tertiary age Tschicoma Formation. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Navajita, Piojillo, and Totavi soils. Navajita soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on north-facing footslopes of valley sides. Piojillo soils are sandy, do not have mollic epipedons, and occur on south facing footslopes of valley sides. Totavi soils are sandy, are well drained, and occur on low stream terraces of valley floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; very low surface runoff; permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part. These soils are subject to rare periods of flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Metate soils are used for wildlife habitat and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is Rocky Mountain maple, blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, willow, and cottonwood.  The ecological site is Populus fremontii/Salix exigua-Salix/Carex(F036XB137NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Metate soils are of small extent on the southwestern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update, 2008. The typical pedon is in Sandoval County, New Mexico; Bandelier National Monument Soil Survey.  Metate is a coined name.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 28 inches. (A1, A2, A3, and AC horizons)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches. (A3, AC, C1, and C2 horizons)
Vitrandic feature - Based on volcanic glass content throughout the upper 30 inches (A1, A2, A3, AC, and C1 horizons).
Irregular decrease in organic carbon - inferred from the stratified textures.
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
