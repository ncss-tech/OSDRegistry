MILAN SERIES

The Milan series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loamy Pleistocene alluvium on treads and risers of paleoterraces, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A0. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 810 mm (32 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Udic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Milan loam in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 384 m (1260 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many roots; few pebbles up to 20 mm in diameter; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 36 cm [7 to 14 in])

  BA--25 to 36 cm (10 to 14 in); brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; hard, firm; many roots; few pebbles; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the BA horizon is 0 to 15 cm [0 to 6 in)

  Bt--36 to 86 cm (14 to 34 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate and strong medium and coarse blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; few fine roots; few distinct clay films of darker color on exterior of peds; few pebbles; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bt horizon is 38 to 76 cm [15 to 30 in])

  BC--86 to 122 cm (34 to 48 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine roots; few pebbles; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the BC horizon is 15 to 51 cm [6 to 20 in])

  C--122 to 178 cm (48 to 70 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; hard, friable; few fine roots; many pebbles; neutral.
