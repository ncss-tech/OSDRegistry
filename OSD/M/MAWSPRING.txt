MAWSPRING SERIES

The Mawspring series are very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from argillite, quartzite and sandstone.  These soils are on fan remnants, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 6 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mawspring very channery loam, in rangeland on a 27 percent slope at 2,100 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 35 percent channers; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw--15 to 33 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 45 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 70 cm thick)

    BC--33 to 84 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 65 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual irregular boundary.  (25 to 70 cm thick)

    C--84 to 152 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) extremely channery sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine irregular pores; 65 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.6).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Soapgulch, Surdal and Sigbird soils which occur on similar landforms.  Soapgulch soils have a mollic epipedon.  Surdal soils are moderately deep to aa lithic contact.  Sigbird soils are shallow to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mawspring soils are used mainly for rangeland. Potential native vegetation is Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, prairie junegrass, big sagebrush and Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mawspring soils are of small extent in the intermontane basins of central Montana. MLRA 43B.
