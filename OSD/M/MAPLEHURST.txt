MAPLEHURST SERIES

The Maplehurst series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils which are deep to stratified sandy outwash.  These soils formed mostly in loess or silty alluvium underlain by stratified sandy outwash on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maplehurst silt loam - on a plane west-facing 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 1245 feet.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.

   Ap--0 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; about 1 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Clark County, Wisconsin; about 4 miles north and 2 miles west of Withee; 1500 feet north and 350 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 5, T. 29 N., R. 2 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to the sandy outwash all range from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the particle size control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  The ratio of coarse silt to fine silt ranges from 1.25 to 2.50 in the silty mantle.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy lower subsoil.  Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 10 percent below it.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon but it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Free carbonates are absent to a depth of more than 5 feet.  Redoximorphic concentrations typically are throughout the pedon below the A or Ap horizon.  Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less are at least as high as the upper 10 inches of the argillic.  Aquic conditions occur in the upper 10 inches of the argillic at some time in most years.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated areas have Ap horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where the value moist is 3 in the Ap horizon, the value dry is greater than 5.5.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is silt loam or silt.

Maplehurst soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.

The Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Some pedons have a Btg horizon, with dominant chroma of 2, below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.

The 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.

Some pedons have a 3Bt horizon (2Bt horizon in pedons without a loamy 2Bt horizon) with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.

The 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy 2Bt horizon) has color like the 3Bt horizon described above.  It is typically stratified layers of sand or coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly.  It averages more than 85 percent sand in the fine earth fraction.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Almena, and Comstock series.    Almena soils have a densic contact with till within the series control section.  Comstock soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Formed in 40 to 60 inches of loess or silty alluvium underlain by stratified sandy outwash.
Landform: Outwash plain and stream terraces.
Slope: 0 to 3 percent.
Elevation: 800 to 1950 feet.
Mean annual air temperature: 39 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 28 to 33 inches.
Frost-free days: 120 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blackriver, Brander, Brill, Poskin, Rib, and Ribriver soils.  The moderately well drained Brill soils, the somewhat poorly drained Poskin soils, and the poorly drained Rib soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the silty mantle is less than 40 inches thick.

The moderately well drained Blackriver and Ribriver soils are in a drainage sequence with Maplehurst soils.  These soils are on higher landscape positions.

The moderately well drained Brander and Brill soils, the somewhat poorly drained Poskin soils, and the poorly drained Rib soils are on nearby landscapes with Maplehurst soils where the silty mantle is less than 40 inches thick.  Brander and Brill soils are on higher landscape positions.  Poskin soils are on similar landscape positions.  Rib soils are in depressions and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Surface runoff is low or medium.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy substratum.  This soil has an apparent seasonal high water table at depths of 1 to 2.5 feet at some time during the period of October to June in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas have been cleared and used for cropland or pastureland.  Corn, small grains, and hay are the principal crops.  The native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest with white pine, white spruce, eastern hemlock, sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, American elm, white ash, balsam fir, and quaking aspen the major species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Wisconsin.  LRR K and MLRA 90B.  This soil is of small extent.
