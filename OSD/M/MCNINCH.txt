MCNINCH SERIES

The McNinch series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from quartzite.  These soils occur on hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean air annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: McNinch very gravelly loam, in rangeland on a 20 percent slope at an elevation of 1987 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A1--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.

   A2--13 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles and less than 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 horizons - 20 to 30 cm)

   Bk--28 to 66 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles and less than 1 percent stones; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, 30 percent fine and medium soft masses of calcium carbonate and common distinct calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick)

   BCk--66 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 55 percent cobbles and less than 1 percent stones; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and common distinct calcium carbonate coats on underside of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
