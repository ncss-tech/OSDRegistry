MOREGLADE SERIES

The Moreglade series consists of deep to very deep, well-drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff, rhyolite and basalt. They are on canyonsides and foothills and have slopes of 12 to 65 percent. The average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C, and the average annual precipitation is about 340 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Moreglade very stony loam in rangeland on a concave 42 percent northeast facing sideslope at an elevation of 1775 meters. When the soil was described on August 20, 1990 the pedon was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A1--0 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very stony loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular and common medium irregular pores;  15 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 25 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick)

     A2--18 to 30 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular and few medium irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 15 cm thick)

     A3--30 to 66 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular and few medium irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 36 cm thick)

     Bt1--66 to 107 cm;  brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; few distinct clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 43 cm thick)

     Bt2--107 to 150 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine, fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and few very fine and fine irregular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles;  neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (30 to 56 cm thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Gooding County, Idaho; about 28.1 km north and 4.8 km east of Bliss; about 185 meters south and 200 meters west of the northeast corner of section 9, T3S.,R13E.  Lat. 43 deg. 10 min. 20 sec. North, Long. 114 deg. 54 min. 50 sec. West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Thickness of mollic epipedon - 50 to 107 cm
Rock fragments in control section - 35 to 75 percent
Base saturation - 50 to 75 percent (by sum of cations) in the upper 30 inches

A horizons
Value - 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 1 through 3 dry and moist
Rock fragments - 0 to 50 percent gravel
                 5 to 35 percent cobbles
                 5 to 25 percent stones
                 0 to 15 percent boulders

Bt horizons
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma - 3 through 6
Rock fragments - 15 to 40 percent gravel
                 15 to 50 percent cobbles
                 0 to 10 percent stones
Texture - CBV-CL, CBX-CL, CBV-L, GRV-L

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Getaway, Greystoke, Jumbo, Sherval, Smarts and Tonocana series.  Getaway, Greystoke, Sherval, and Smarts soils have O horizons. Jumbo has a hue of 7.5YR in the A1 and A2 horizons. Tonocana is formed in colluvium from sandstone and quartzite and have coarse textures in the lower part of the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moreglade soils are on foothills and canyonsides and have slopes of 12 to 65 percent . These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from welded tuff, rhyolite and basalt. Elevations are 1430 to 1890 meters. Average annual temperature is 5 to 6 degrees C.  Average annual precipitation is 330 to 410 millimeters. Frost-free season is about 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Molyneux, Fergie, Stash and Terracecreek series.  Fergie soils are found in more concave positions are not pachic. Molyneux soils are found in similar positions but are formed in colluvium over old alluvium and contain less the 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Stash is found on toe slopes and is clayey-skeletal. Terracecreek is found on upper slopes and is moderately deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Moreglade soils are used primarily for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is primarily mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are of small extent in southcentral Idaho.
