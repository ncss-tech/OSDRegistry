  Major Uses: Cultivated crops.  Where cultivated, mostly agronomic crops such as corn, wheat and soybeans          and to a lesser extent truck crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
  Distribution: MLRAs 153C and 153D within Maryland
  Extent: Small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: Somerset County, Maryland, 2000.

REMARKS: Manokin soils were previously mapped as Mattapex.  Manokin soils differ from Mattapex by having a particle control section that is fine-loamy rather than fine-silty.  Manokin is named for a tributary of Tangier Sound (bordered by Hazard Point to the north and South Deal Island to the south). Manokin 
is an Algonquin (native American tribe) word which translated means earth dug out.
Below 75 inches few medium strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) iron concentrations were observed in this pedon.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 17 inches (Ap1, Ap2 and BE horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 17 to 37 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons)
Aquic subgroup--the soil has redox depletions with color value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less, and redox concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Lithologic discontinuity at 23 inches 
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S00MD039-010.  Additional reference samples include sample numbers S99MD039021-1, 2, S039024-1, 2, S99039030-1, 2, 3, S00MD039084-2, 3, 4 (University of Maryland, College Park, MD) on file at Somerset County, MD Field Office.
