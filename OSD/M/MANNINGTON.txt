MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1995. 

REMARKS: Mannington soils were previously mapped as tidal marsh or fresh water marsh miscellaneous land types. This series was first proposed in Salem County, New Jersey, in 1993, but was first correlated in Maryland in 1995. 

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 36 cm (Ag horizon).
Aquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 200 cm is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
High n-value--the zone from the soil surface to 81 cm and from 132 to 229 cm flows easily between the fingers when squeezed.
A buried organic horizon, at least 20 cm thick, that has its upper boundary within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface.
