MACMEAL SERIES 

The Macmeal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 60  percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Macmeal gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    0i1--2 inches to 1-inch; mat of twigs, leaves, and dead plants. 

    0i2--1-inch to 0; layer of slightly decomposed organic material. 

    E--0 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine pores; many unstained sand and silt grains; 20 percent pebbles, 5 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bt1--7 to 14 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 50 percent pebbles, 5 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--14 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent channers, 15 percent flagstones; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bt3--32 to 48 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely channery clay loam dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent channers, 15 percent flagstones; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 20 to 45 inches) 

    Bk--48 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely flaggy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 40 channers, 25 percent flagstones; common distinct lime coats on underside of fragments; slightly alkaline.
