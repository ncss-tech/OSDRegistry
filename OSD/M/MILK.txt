MILK SERIES

The Milk series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from rhyolite with a loess influence.  Milk soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Milk silt loam on a hill with  an 11 percent slope at an elevation of 1,895 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 28 cm thick)

 AB--20 to 35 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine tubular and very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

 Bt--35 to 57 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common fine and medium tubular and medium irregular pores; few (10 percent) distinct clay films on all ped faces; 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (22 to 48 cm thick)

 Bk--57 to 72 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine irregular and very fine tubular pores; calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; common (12 percent) masses of calcium carbonate; 45 percent gravel and 15 percent flagstones; strongly effervescent (42 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

 R--72 to 152 cm; rhyolite

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amelar, Broad, Custco, Dra, Drage, Rawnjay, Remount, Scalfar, Searla,Sheep Creek, Small and Swampydraw, series. Amelar, Custco, Dra, Drage, Rawnjay, Remount, Scalfar, Searla, and Swampydraw soils very deep.  Broad and Sheep Creek soils do not have flagstones in the particle size control section. Small soils have a calcic horizon that starts between 8 to 13 cm deep and do not contain flagstones in the particle size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: plateaus
Landform: hills
Elevation: 1,817 to 2,133 meters
Slope: 0 to 30 percent
Parent material: residuum weathered from rhyolite with a loess influence
Mean annual air temperature: 3.3 to 5.6 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: 405 to 660 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bull, Conneridge, and Parkalley soil series. Bull, Conneridge, and Parkalley all occur on the same landform. Bull soils are deep and occur on linear/concave positions. Conneridge soils lack an argillic horizon and occur on shoulder positions. Parkalley soils are very deep and occur on north-facing slopes.
