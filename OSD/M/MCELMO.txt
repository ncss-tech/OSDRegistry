MCELMO SERIES

The McElmo series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable, sodic soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from bentonitic shale and sandstone on dipslopes of cuestas.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McElmo soils are on dipslopes of cuestas.  They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Jurassic bentonitic shale and sandstone.  Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beclabito, Bodot and Farview soils.  Beclabito soils are fine-loamy and lack gypsic horizons.   Bodot soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and are undeveloped.  Farview soils are very shallow to a lithic contact and are undeveloped.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: McElmo soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is galleta, alkali sacaton, sand dropseed, shadscale, cheatgrass, mound saltbush, and desert seepweed with widely scattered Utah juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: McElmo soils are of small extent on the Blanding Basin portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shiprock Area, Parts of San Juan County, New Mexico and Apache County, Arizona; 1993.

REMARKS:  The series type location was moved to the Shiprock Soil Survey Area in Western San Juan County, New Mexico in 1988; this area better represents the taxonomic classification.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 1 inch.  (A horizon)

Natric horizon - The zone from 1 to about 14 inches.  (2Btn/E and 2Btkn horizons)

Calcic horizon - The zone from 14 to about 30 inches.
(3Bky1 horizon)

Gypsic horizon - The zone from 30 to about 54 inches.
(3Bky2 and 3CY horizons)

Paralithic contact - The presence of soft shale bedrock
at about 54 inches.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Percent gypsum and SAR values are estimated.  Salinity values were determined on three pedons with an Instant EC salinity kit.  Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined with a field volume calcimeter.
