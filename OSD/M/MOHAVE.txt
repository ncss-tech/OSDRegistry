MOHAVE SERIES

The Mohave series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Mohave soils are on fan terraces, basin floors, and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calciargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mohave sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular and common very fine irregular pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

(5 to 15 inches thick)

    Btk--39 to 55 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; violently effervescent, many fine calcium carbonate accumulations as filaments and soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 16 inches thick)

    2C--55 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly loamy coarse sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; common fine irregular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blackmagic (CA), Brenda (NM), Cornville (AZ), Dona Ana (NM), Elizario (NM), Hap (NM), Jagerson (AZ), Kidwell (NV), Lanip (NV), Madurez (NM), McNew (NM), Nutt (NM), Poachie (AZ), Tres Hermanos (NM) series. Blackmagic soils have an accumulation of gypsum within 40 inches of the surface. Brenda soils have gravelly coarse sand in the lower part of the profile below the argillic horizon. Cornville soils have greater than 50 percent sand in the control section.  Dona Ana and Tres Hermanos soils have calcic horizons at depths less than 20 inches.  Elizario soils have more than 50 percent sand in the series control section and are in the Chihuahuan Desert (MLRA 42) and have a summer maximum precipitation pattern. Hap and Tres Hermanos soils average more than 15 percent gravel in the argillic horizon. Madurez soils have argillic horizons less than 10 inches thick and sola less than 25 inches thick. McNew soils have 18 to 27 percent clay. Blackmagic, Jagerson, Kidwell, Lanip and Poachie soils receive most of the precipitation in the winter are moist for less than 20 days cumulative in the summer and occur in MLRA 30.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mohave soils are on basin floors, fan terraces, and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in mixed alluvium from acid and basic igneous rocks. Elevation is 1800 to 5000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Dona Ana and Tres Hermanos soils, are the Guest and Pinaleno soils.  Guest soils are fine.  Pinaleno soils are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is mesquite, paloverde, creosotebush, bursage, cactus, bush muhly, threeawns, Arizona cottontop, plains bristlegrass, sixweeks grama and Indianwheat.  Irrigated areas are planted to alfalfa, cotton, citrus, vegetables and other crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Arizona, and New Mexico.  The Mohave series is extensive.  MLRA is 40, 41 & 42. This series has been used in the Mojave Desert (MLRA 30) in California. Continued use of this series in MLRA 30 in California is discouraged.
