MENBAR SERIES

The Menbar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on floodplains.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Aquic Cumulic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Menbar clay loam, on a 2 percent slope - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.

     A1--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

     A2--2 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular and few very fine to medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  ( 3 to 9 inches thick)

     A3--9 to 20 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular and few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated and in common fine soft masses; few small distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) iron concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

     C--20 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stratified moderately thick lenses of sandy loam, sandy clay loam and clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; 1 to 2 inch thick black lenses in lower part; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common small faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) iron concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uinta County, Wyoming; about 2 miles northeast of Lonetree; about 400 feet west of NE corner of Section 34, T13N, R113W; Lonetree USGS quad; approximate lat. 41 degrees 04 minutes 11 seconds N. and long. 110 degrees 07 minutes 36 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
The mollic epipedon: 16 to 37 inches thick.
The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.
The organic matter content: 2 to 5 percent in the A horizon and decreases irregularly with depth.
Rock fragment content of rounded gravel and cobble is typically less than 5 percent but may range from 0 to 15 percent above the 40 inch depth.
Some pedons have a very gravelly or cobbly loamy sand substratum below 40 inches.
These soils typically are calcareous throughout the major part of the profile but noncalcareous layers do occur.
Electrical conductivity is less than 2 mmhos throughout.

Particle-size control section (weighted averages)
Texture: stratified textures of sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, and sandy clay loam
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent

A horizon
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 through 3
Redox concentrations in the lower part are common.
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

C horizon
Hue: 2.5Y or 10YR
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma: 1 through 3
Redox concentrations occur in most pedons and darker layers are also common.
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no competitors. The Silas series in a closely related family does not have endosaturation within 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Menbar soils are on floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation is 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 80 days but frost may occur at any time in some locales.  These soils are occasionally to rarely flooded.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Henrysfork and Turson soils.  Henrysfork soils have a carbonatic mineralogy.  Turson soils have a sandy-skeletal substratum at 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained, low runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.  A seasonal water table is at 3 to 5 feet.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as rangeland and also irrigated hayland and pasture.  Native vegetation is sedges, grasses such as basin wildrye, tufted hairgrass and western wheatgrass, cinquefoil, willow, iris, and narrowleaf cottonwood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Wyoming and northeastern Utah. MLRA 34A, 47. It is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Henrys Fork soil survey area, Utah and Wyoming, 1990.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon (Cumulic feature) - from 0 to 20 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons); an irregular decrease in organic carbon is inferred from the stratification.
Aquic conditions and endosaturation - in the layers below 20 inches; inferred from redox concentration and chroma of 2 in part. This conflicts with the original depth to water table, but that depth is presumed over-estimated (too deep).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of A3 and C horizons)
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.

Soil temperature data are from a 10 year record one mile from type location on a similar soil. When established the Menbar series was classified as fine-loamy, mixed Cumulic Cryoborolls.
