MELVILLE SERIES

The Melville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, relict stream terraces, moraines, and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.
