MARINA SERIES

The Marina series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in old eolian deposits. Marina soils are on fluviomarine terraces, marine terraces, and coastal plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Lamellic Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Marina   soils in an area of Marina loamy sand on a slope of 5 percent facing south at an elevation of 165 meters under a cover of annual grasses, formerly cultivated. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Ap1--0 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) light loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

 Ap2--18 to 30 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) light loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial and common fine and few medium tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

 E and Bt1--68 to 83 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few fine and medium tubular pores; several thin 1/4 inch thick discontinuous lamellae, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2, 3/3) moist, lamellae are hard when dry and have thick clay bridges; very weak clay bridges in matrix; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

 E and Bt2--83 to 125 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) light loamy sand, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 3 continuous distinct lamellae, top, bottom and middle, 1/4 to 3/4 inch thick, hard and friable, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; thick clay bridges in lamellae, very weak bridges in matrix; strongly acid (pH 5.5); gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 50 cm thick)

 E and Bt3--125 to 150 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) sand, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; soft, loose; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; several brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry lamellae 1/4 to 3/4 inch thick, bands hard and friable; moderate clay bridges in lamellae; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 38 cm thick)

 E and Bt4--150 to 220 cm; pink (7.5YR 7/4) sand, reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) moist; single grained; soft, loose; many very fine interstitial pores; weak continuous lamellae 1 to 1.5 inches thick about 3 inches apart; thin clay bridges in lamellae; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monterey County (Salinas Area), California, 1925.

REMARKS: The Marina soils were formerly classified as Regosols. The classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as mixed, thermic, Alfic Xeropsamments. Competing series were not checked at that time.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 68 cm
Lamellae: the zone from 68 to 220 cm
