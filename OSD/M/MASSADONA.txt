MASSADONA SERIES

The Massadona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Massadona soils are on hills, toeslopes, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Massadona silty clay loam, on an east facing slope in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, very sticky and plastic; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    BA--3 to 11 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silty clay, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and plastic; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--11 to 26 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silty clay, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and plastic; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    BCk--26 to 50 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silty clay, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and plastic; strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate in filaments; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

    Cy--50 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silty clay, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, very sticky and plastic; common nests of gypsum; strongly effervescent, moderately alkaline.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Degater series.   
Degater:  paralithic contact less than 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from shale
Landform:  hills, toeslopes, and alluvial fans
Slopes:  0 to 12 percent
Elevation:  4,700 to 6,300 feet
Mean annual temperature:  45 to 49 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 11 inches
Precipitation pattern:  precipitation is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year with 40 percent comming as snow November through April
Frost-free period:  95 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chipeta and Deaver series.  The Chipeta soils are shallow.  The Deaver soils are moderately deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high to very high runoff, very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential native vegetation is shadscale, Nuttal saltbush, budsage, salina wildrye, and wheatgrasses.
