MAMOU SERIES

The Mamou series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Prairie Terrace Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils occur on elongated deltaic natural levees. .  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).
