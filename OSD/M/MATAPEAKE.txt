USE: Almost all areas of Matapeake soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and small grains are commonly grown. A small amount of acreage is irrigated.

VEGETATION: Native vegetation is dominated by oaks and some cutover areas have loblolly, Virginia, or shortleaf pine.

DISTRIBUTION: The Coastal Plain of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey

EXTENT: Large

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Pasquotank County, North Carolina, 1951

REMARKS: Matapeake soils were previously classified as having a fine-loamy particle-size control section.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches (Ap and E horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 11 to 38 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and 2BC horizons)
