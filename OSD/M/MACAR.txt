MACAR SERIES 

The Macar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived mainly from semiconsolidated sandstone and siltstone sedimentary beds.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.
