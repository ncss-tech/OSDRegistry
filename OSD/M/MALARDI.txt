MALARDI SERIES

The Malardi series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loamy outwash sediments and the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash sediments. These soils are on nearly level or convex slopes on outwash plains, stream terraces and on collapsed glacial alluvium within ground moraines or end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Malardi sandy loam, on a convex slope of about 4 percent, on a glacial outwash plain, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 25 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine roots; about 4 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (17 to 30 centimeters thick) 

 Bt1--25 to 38 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few discontinuous dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds; common fine roots; about 6 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 40 centimeters thick) 

 2Bt2--38 to 74 centimeters; brown (10YR 4/3) loamy coarse sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; clay bridging between sand grains; few fine roots; about 8 percent gravel; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 41 centimeters thick) 

 2C--74 to 203 centimeters; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sand; single grain; loose; about 16 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 74 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 25 to 74 centimeters (Bt and 2Bt horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
