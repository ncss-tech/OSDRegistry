MILLHI SERIES

The Millhi series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in lacustrine sediments with a thin mantle of slope alluvium.  Millhi soils are on foothills and dissected lacustrine terraces and have slopes of 2 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Millhi gravelly silt loam--on a 14 percent smooth northeast-facing slope in rangeland at 5,700 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise stated.  When described on September 22, 1982 the soil was dry to a depth of 9 inches and moist below.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Millhi soils are on lacustrine terraces and foothills and have slopes of 2 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in lacustrine sediments.  Elevations are 3,900 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  Frost free period is 75 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cronks, Lacrol, Perreau, Venum, and Zer soils.  Cronks and Venum soils are on foothills and mountains, and have clayey-skeletal control sections. Cronks soils have mollic epipedons.  Perreau and Zer soils are on terraces and foothills.  Perreau soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Zer soils have loamy-skeletal control sections.  Lacrol soils are on north and east aspects in concave positions on foothills and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained, medium to very rapid runoff, very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lemhi County, Idaho, 1999.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon

Natric horizon - The zone from 4 to 17 inches (Bt and Btk horizons).

Linear extensibility is estimated to be 6 to 8 cm in the upper meter.

The gypsic material does meet the gypsum requirement to qualify as a gypsic horizon.

The particle-size control section is the natric horizon which is the zone from 4 to 17 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons).

Some pedons have EB or E/B horizons.
