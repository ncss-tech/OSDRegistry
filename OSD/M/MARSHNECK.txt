SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Office

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washington County, Rhode Island, 2010.

REMARKS:  This subaqueous soil series was mapped previously as water in the states listed above.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include--
Peraquic feature--Positive soil water potential (continuous inundation) at the soil surface (under 80 centimeters of brackish water).
Particle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches) is coarse- loamy.
Hypersulfidic materials--The zone from 27 to 161 centimeters (Cseg3, Cseg4, Cseg5, and Cseg6 horizons) have oxidized reactions with pH values less than 4 after 16 weeks.
Haplic feature--The zone from 20 and 50 centimeters (Cseg2 and Cseg3 horizons) has a fluidity class of nonfluid.
Type location was moved to Connecticut as part of the Long Island Sound Coastal Zone Soil Survey in 2024, based on supporting laboratory analysis conducted at the University of Connecticut.
