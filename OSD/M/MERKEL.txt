MERKEL SERIES

The Merkel series consists of moderately deep (to a densic contact), well drained soils that formed glacial till derived from granitic sources with a mixture of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on hillslopes, mountain slopes and moraines. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 525 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.

Elbowlake and Nevine soils have a mantle of volcanic ash more than 14 inches (36 cm) thick with a bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc. Nevine soils are on moraines, foothills and mountains. Goddard soils are sandy-skeletal and are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments. Newbell soils have a mantle of volcanic ash 18 to 36 cm thick with a bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days. Elbowlake and Newbell soils are on mountain backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes. Talls soils are more than 18 percent clay in the lower part of the particle-size control section and are on hills and mountains. Torboy soils are sandy and are on terraces and terrace escarpments.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high over moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.
