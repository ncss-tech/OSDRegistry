MONTEZ SERIES

The Montez series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in granite colluvium.  Montez soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Palecryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Montez sandy loam - forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    02 & 01--2 inches to 0; undecomposed and partially decomposed pine needles, twigs, and grass.

    A1--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    A2--7 to 22 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (12 to 18 inches thick)

    A&B--22 to 28 inches; mixed light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) heavy sandy loam (composite texture), dark brown (10YR 4/3) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 60 percent of material is similar to that of the overlying horizon; the B material is in pockets surrounded by A material in the upper part of the horizon and the A material is in pockets surrounded by B material in the lower part; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    B2t--28 to 36 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    B3t--36 to 41 inches; brownish yellowish (10YR 6/6) gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; 30 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    C--41 to 51 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) very gravelly loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4).  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    R--50 inches; granite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Huerfano County, Colorado; 2,530 feet west and 300 feet north of SE corner of Sec. 33, T. 26 S., R. 72 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches.  The depth to the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 36 inches.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in the particle-size control section and range from 25 to 60 percent below the B2t horizon.  They are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.

The A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 1 through 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.

The A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.

The A&B horizon has colors of both the A2 and B2t horizons.

The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It averages 18 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 75 percent sand.

The C horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fitzgerald, Hub, Loggert, and Rimton series.  Fitzgerald and Loggert soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the major part of the solum.  Hub and Rimton soils have an argillic horizon with the upper boundary within a depth of 24 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Montez soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  Elevation at the type location is approximately 9,500 feet.  The soils formed in colluvial material from granite.  The soils are in a cold and dry climate with annual precipitation ranging from 20 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rogert and Woodhall soils.  Rogert soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock, have a mollic epipedon, and have more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Woodhall soils have a mollic epipedon, more than 35 percent rock fragments, and have bedrock within 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for forestry, recreation and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, aspen, Engelman spruce, Douglas-fir, with an understory of common juniper, snowberry, Arizona fescue, nodding brome, and pussytoes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Rocky Mountains of Colorado.  These soils are of small extent.
