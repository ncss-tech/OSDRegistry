MEGONOT SERIES

The Megonot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semi-consolidated shale, siltstone or mudstone, or in alluvium over semi-consolidated shale, siltstone or mudstone. These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, ridges, strath terraces, sedimentary plains, lake plains, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Megonot silty clay loam, in non-irrigated cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Bk--12 to 21 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine discontinuous tubular pores; 10 percent soft weathered shale fragments; few medium masses of segregated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    By--21 to 29 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive or thin platy structure as a result of in situ weathering of shale; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots in cracks and between plates; common fine threads and seams of gypsum; 25 percent soft shale fragments, 10 percent hard shale fragments; disseminated lime; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    2Cr--29 to 60 inches; mixed dark gray (5Y 4/1) and olive gray (5Y 4/2) semi-consolidated shale; hard and firm; neutral (pH 6.8).
