MCDERMAND SERIES

The McDermand series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, alluvium, colluvium and till over residuum weathered from granite. The McDermand soils are in cirques and on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1075 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION: Fresno County, California, near Sapphire Lake in Evolution Valley in Kings Canyon National Park; USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle: Mount Darwin, California; WGS84 37.152236 latitude and -118.693357 longitude; UTM zone 11 4113103 meters N 349627 meters E NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm is -1 to 5 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is less than 6 degrees C. The soils have a cryic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about September to October (about 50 days). The soils contain a seasonal water table as high as 30 cm during the winter, spring and early summer months, falling to below 100 cm during late summer and fall.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Evolution, Lapin, and Siberian soils. Evolution soils have a densic contact within 100 to 150 cm of the mineral soil surface, and redox concentrations within 50 to 100 cm of the mineral soil surface. Lapin soils have a densic contact between 50 and 100 cm of the mineral soil surface. Siberian soils have a densic contact between 100 and 200 cm of the mineral soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The McDermand soils are in swales and on structural benches in cirques and on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium, alluvium, colluvium, and till over residuum weathered from granite. Elevation is 2275 to 4140 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 620 to 1505 mm and the mean annual air temperature is -2 to 4 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Forgotten and Langille soils. The Forgotten soils formed in the channels and floodplain steps of high gradient drainageways and do not have a lithic contact.  The Langille soils formed on convex structural benches and are moderately deep, loamy-skeletal, and well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is very low to high. Rare or occasional flooding for very brief duration from May to June. Seasonal high water table between 30 to 100 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is purple mountainheath, dwarf bilberry, and shorthair reedgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
