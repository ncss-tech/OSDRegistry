MORCONICK SERIES

The Morconick series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 20 to 40 centimeters of loamy alluvium and the underlying sandy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Mollic Udifluvents

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Wathena series.
Wathena--are in areas with more than 820 millimeters of mean annual precipitation and mean annual air temperature that is greater than 11 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Albaton, Grable, Haynie, Lossing, Sarpy, Scroll, and Vore soils.
Albaton--are in the lower landscape positions, are frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest portions of normal years, and have a clay content of 50 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section
Grable--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Morconick soils and have silty alluvium 45 to 75 centimeters thick over sandy alluvium
Haynie--are in the slightly lower landscape positions and have a clay content of 15 to 18 percent in the particle-size control section
Lossing--are in the slightly lower landscape positions and have a clay content of 18 to 35 percent throughout the particle-size control section
Sarpy--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Morconick soils and do not have silty alluvial sediments
Scroll--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Morconick soils, have sandy alluvial sediments within depths of 25 to 40 centimeters, and have a clay content of 27 to 35 percent in the upper third of the particle-size control section
Vore--are in the slightly lower landscape positions, have sandy alluvial sediments within a depth of 40 to 75 centimeters, and have a clay content of 28 to 35 percent in the upper third to upper half of the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--well drained--a frequently saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during April to June in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second in the loamy alluvium and 10.00 to 100.00 micrometers per second  in the underlying sandy alluvium
Surface runoff potential--negligible to low
Flooding--rarely to frequently flooded for brief to long periods during the months of February to November in normal years resulting from precipitation events and snowmelt, flooding from river channel overflow is limited where these soils are protected by dams and levees

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans and small grains. Some areas are irrigated. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass and other grasses of the tall grass prairie and deciduous trees.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (C1, 2C2, 2C3, 2C4, and 2C5 horizons).
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, C1, 2C2, 2C3, 2C4, 2C5, 2C6, 2C7, and 2C8 horizons).
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters (Ap horizon).
Udic moisture regime.

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.

Redoximorphic features in this profile are believed to be relict features related to the moisture status of the materials at the time of deposition. These features are believed not to be related to present day saturation.

Morconick soils were included with Grable, Carr, Sarpy and Mixed Alluvial Lands in previous soil surveys.
