MENARD SERIES

The Menard series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils developed in loamy calcareous slope alluvium over residuum. These soils are on nearly level to sloping alluvial plain remnants. Slope are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in).

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for crops and rangeland. Crops grown are grain sorghum, small grain, peanuts, and peaches. Native grasses are mostly little bluestem, sand lovegrass, purpletop, sand dropseed, tumble windmillgrass, and hairy tridens. Woody vegetation consists of post oak, mesquite, whitebrush, tasajillo, pricklypear, and Texas persimmon.
