COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hodenpyl, Oconto, Omena, and Perote series. Hodenpyl, Oconto, Omena, and Perote soils have dominate textures of sandy loam or finer within the upper 50 cm (20 inches) of the profile. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Millersburg soils are on ground moraines, disintegration moraines, and drumlins of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 35 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent. Millersburg soils formed in sandy and loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blue Lake, Klacking, Graycalm, Rubicon, Bamfield, Lupton, and Tawas soils. The very poorly drained Lupton and Tawas soils occur on lower landscape positions. Blue Lake, Graycalm and Rubicon soils are coarser textured associates while the Bamfield soil is a finer textured associate. Klacking soils have similar textures and have a banded argillic horizon. They occur on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high, depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the soils are in woodland. A small amount is in permanent pasture or idle cropland. Principal tree species include sugar maple, northern red oak, red maple, eastern white pine, red pine, jack pine, quaking aspen and black cherry. In some areas American basswood and American beech are present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A and 96 in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
