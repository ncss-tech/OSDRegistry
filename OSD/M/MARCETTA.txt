MARCETTA SERIES

The Marcetta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17  inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Marcetta gravelly loam, native grass cover (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0568.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 25 inches (A horizons); an albic horizon from 25 to 33 inches (E horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A2, A3, E, and part of E/B horizons).  Marcetta soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
