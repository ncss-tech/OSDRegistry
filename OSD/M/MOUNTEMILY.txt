MOUNTEMILY SERIES

The Mountemily series consists of very deep, well drained soils on ridgetops, side slopes and shoulders of mountains. Mountemily soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium derived from basalt and andesitic basalt. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mountemily soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains. Elevations are 5,200 to 7,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The soil is formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium derived from basalts and andesitic basalts. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F. The frost-free period is 25 to 70 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These soils are McNamee and Troutmeadows. McNamee soils occur on side slopes of mountains and have 7 to 14 inches of volcanic ash and an argillic horizon. The competing Troutmeadows soils occur on side slopes of mountains and are moderately deep to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, watershed, recreation and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, western larch, Engleman spruce, grouse huckleberry, big huckleberry, twinflower, Oregon boxwood, prince's pine, sidebells pyrola, round-leaved violet, white hawkweed, pinegrass and northwestern sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon; MLRA 43c. The soils are of small extent.

The dominant USFS plant association is ABLA/VASC/POPU3; others may include PICO(ABLA)/VASC/POPU3 and ABLA2/POPU3. On ridge slope positions PICO(ABLA)/VASC/POPU3 may be the dominant plant association.
