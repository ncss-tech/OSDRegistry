Months: March to June 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, wheat, 
and soybeans. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses and trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Kansas and possibly Southeast Nebraska;
not extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brown County, Kansas, 1991. 

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 102 centimeters. (A1, A2, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 178 centimeters. (All A, Bw horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: In the zone from 41 to 112 centimeters. (A2, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)
Redoximorphic depletions: In the zone from 112 to 178 centimeters. (Bw3, Bw4 horizons)
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation > 46 centimeters. (A2 through Bg horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: These soils were originally mapped as Wabash in the original 
Brown County survey. These soils are better drained than Wabash soils. The name was changed from the proposed Powhattan series. A complete pedon analysis is available from NSSL as pedon number S90-KS-013-008. ]

9/2008 GJJ added metric conversions, removed English units, and made some format 
changes.  

10/2008 JCR Changed the taxonomic nomenclature from Bw and Bg to Bss and Bgss as 
slickensides were identified in the typical pedon.  There are many supporting profile descriptions with slickensides.  This soil has not been changed to a vertisol because the upper 18 centimeters for most pedons is less than 30 percent clay. 

11/2008 JCR expanded seasonal saturation to January through June based on observations of field soil scientists.
