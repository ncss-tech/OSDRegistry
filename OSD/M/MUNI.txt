MUNI SERIES

The Muni series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and siliceous sedimentary rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Muni soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Diawell soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, have calcic horizons, and have duripans that are 5 to 13 cm thick.  Mickey soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C., are intermittently moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October, and have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.  Minu soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates above the duripan.  Zadvar soils have duripans at depths of 25 to 36 cm from the soil surface, have 20 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section, and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Muni soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and siliceous sedimentary rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.   Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Glyphs, Punchbowl, and Unius soils.  Glyphs soils are fine-loamy, very deep, and have horizons with 30 to 60 percent durinodes.  Punchbowl soils are very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts and have a frigid temperature regime.  Unius soils do not have argillic horizons above the duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Muni soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.  Scattered Utah juniper has invaded the higher elevations of some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28B.
