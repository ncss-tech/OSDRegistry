MIDESSA SERIES

The Midessa series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian and lacustrine deposits derived from the Tahoka and Blackwater Draw Formations of Pleistocene age. Midessa soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping plains, playa slopes, and draws with slopes ranging from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:Well drained and moderate permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and moderate on 5 to 12 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:Mainly used for cropland. Principal crops grown are cotton,
grain sorghum, and wheat. Climax native vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the Limy Upland (R077CY028TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:Southern High Plains of Texas and New Mexico
(MLRA-77C). The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:Hale County, Texas; 1969.

REMARKS:The Midessa series was formerly included in the Gomez and Portales series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in). (A horizon)
Calcic horizon: 76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 in). (Bkk, B'k horizons)
Carbonate plugged horizon (kk): 76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 in) (Bkk horizon)
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.
