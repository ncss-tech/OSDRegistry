MCCREATH SERIES

The McCreath series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess overlying glacial till. The McCreath soils are on broad, nearly level to convex upland areas with little dissection on till plains and on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 685 millimeters (27 inches).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clay County, Iowa, 2002.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Mollic epipedon - zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 43 centimeters (17 inches) (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
Cambic horizon - zone from approximately 43 to 89 centimeters (17 to 35 inches) (Bw1, Bw2);
Calcic horizon - zone from 89 to 112 centimeters (35 to 44 inches) (Bk horizon);
Aquic moisture regime. 

This soil was previously included in the Primghar series. Based on MLRA correlation, soils that have 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess over glacial till will be correlated to this series. Soils that have more than 150 centimeters (60 inches) of loess will be correlated to the Primghar series.
