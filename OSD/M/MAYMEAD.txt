MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Unicoi County, Tennessee; 1980.

REMARKS:
The 2/99 revision updates the classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. This soil is placed in the semiactive CEC activity class based on comparison with associated soils such as Ditney. 11/13 revision verifies classification--11th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy changes format to semitab, and minor changes to Range in Characteristics.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 10 to 38 cm, 4 to 15 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)
b. Cambic horizon--the zone from 38 to 167cm, 15 to 66 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)
c. Lithic contact--the contact with unweathered rock at 167 cm, 66 inches (upper boundary of the R horizon).
