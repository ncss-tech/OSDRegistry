REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--zone from 6 to 24 cm
*Depth to endosaturation--24 cm
*Redoximorphic concentrations--zone from 6 to 150 cm
*Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less--zone from 24 to 104 cm

8/2016--Changed Cg horizon to C horizon due to chroma being higher than 2 throughout the horizon; changed subgroup from Typic Humaquepts to Humic Endoaquepts because the soils do not have an umbric epipedon
