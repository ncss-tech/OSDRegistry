MAUCROS SERIES

The Maucros series consist of deep, well drained soils on mountain sideslopes and rolling plateau summits.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over clayey residuum from pyroclastic tuffs and basalt. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: ashy over clayey-skeletal, glassy over smectitic, frigid Alfic Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Maucros ashy sandy loam - upland forest, on a 10 percent slightly concave slope. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

        2Btb3--46 to 53 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) extremely cobbly clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and modeerately plastic; few fine to medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; many prominent, dark brown (10YR 3/3, moist) clay films on ped faces; 30 percent gravel, 50 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2). (Combined thickness of the 2Btb horizons is 26 to 40 inches.) 

        2R--53 inches; bedrock (volcanic tuff).
