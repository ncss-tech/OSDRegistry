COMPETING SERIES: This is the Modale series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--45 to 80 centimeters of silty alluvium and the underlying silty clay or clay

Elevation--185 to 475 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--8 to 13 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--660 to 1,040 millimeters
Frost-free period--155 to 220 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kennebec, Luton, McPaul, and Woodbury soils.
Kennebec--are on slightly higher landscape positions, have a saturated zone between 1 and 1.8 meters during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, and have a mollic epipedon more than 100 centimeters thick
Luton--are on slightly lower landscape positions, have a saturated zone within a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, and have a clay content of 40 to 75 percent throughout the series control section
McPaul--are on slightly higher landscape positions, have a saturated zone between 1.0 and 1.5 meters during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, and have a clay content of 10 to 18 percent throughout the series control section
Woodbury--are on slightly lower landscape positions, have a saturated zone within a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, have a depth to carbonates range of 90 to 150 centimeters, and have a mollic epipedon 40 to 60 centimeters thick

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained--a saturated zone occurs within depths of 0.3 and 1 meter during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, and this saturation is considered perched
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.0 to 10 micrometers per second in the silty alluvium and .01 to .10 micrometers per second in the underlying silty clay or clay
Flooding--occasionally or rarely flooded for brief duration; flooding from streambank overflow is limited where dams and levees protect areas

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. Surface ditches drain most areas. Some areas are land-leveled and irrigated. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland
Physiographic section--Dissected till plains
MLRA--Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills (107B)
LLR M; on nearly level flood plains within a few miles of the Missouri River and tributaries in Iowa, Nebraska, and Missouri
Extent--moderate

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 200 centimeters (Ap, C1, C2, 2Ab1, 2Ab2, 2Bssgb1, 2Bssgb2, and 2Bsskgb horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 centimeters (Ap horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
