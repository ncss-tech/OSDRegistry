MIKETT SERIES

The Mikett series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Mikett soils are on alluvial fans and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Mikett clay loam, on a northwest facing, 2 percent slope in pasture at an elevation of 5,900 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described in April 1981, the soil was moist from 0 to 34 inches.  Water table was at 34 inches.)

    Ap1--0 to 2 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate thick platy structure parting to moderate medium granular; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Ap2--2 to 8 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--8 to 15 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 30 inches thick)

    C2--15 to 22 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear smooth boundary.   (5 to 35 inches thick)

    C3--22 to 35 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic,; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick) 

    C4--35 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6).  (0 to 30 inches thick) 

TYPE LOCATION: Montezuma County, Colorado; about 5.5 miles southwest of Cortez; located about 190 feet south and 810 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 17, T. 35 N., R. 16 W.; Mud Creek Colorado USGS quad; lat. 37 degrees 17 minutes 48 seconds N. and long. 108 degrees 37 minutes 48 seconds W., NAD27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture regime: aridic bordering on ustic
Soil temperature regime: mesic
Mean annual soil temperature: 48 to 52 degrees F
Water table: depth is 1 to 5 feet, kind is apparent, months are April to August

Particle-size control section:
Clay content: 18 to 35 percent

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR to 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 7 (3 to 6 moist)
Chroma: 2 to 4
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent
Sodium adsorption ratio: 0 to 15
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 7 (3 to 6 moist)
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: clay loam or loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 3 to 10 percent
Sodium adsorption ratio: 5 to 20
Reaction: strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bastian, Parohtog, Rustigate, and Umbo soils.  Bastian soils have Csi horizons. Parohtog and Umbo soils are Aridic.  The Rustigate series is aridic (torric), has a control section clay content of 18 to 27 percent, and is in MLRA 27.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from sandstone and shale
Landform: alluvial fans and drainageways
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent
Elevation: 5,400 to 6,500 feet
Mean annual temperature: 50 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 13 inches
Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer.
Frost-free period: 120 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Mikim series. Mikim soils lack a water table within 60 inches of the surface. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained, medium runoff, moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for range and irrigated cropland.  Dominant vegetation is Indian ricegrass and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 36.  This series is of small extent.
