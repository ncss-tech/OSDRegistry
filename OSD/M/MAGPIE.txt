MAGPIE SERIES

The Magpie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils occur on stream terraces, fan remnants and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal, smectitic over mixed, frigid Typic Natrustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Magpie loam, in irrigated pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed matted roots; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

   E--4 to 11 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate very coarse platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores throughout; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; very slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 15 cm thick)

   Btn--11 to 31 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2), clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong coarse columnar structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine dendritic tubular pores throughout; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; finely disseminated calcium carbonate throughout; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 33 cm thick)

   Btkn1--31 to 42 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores throughout; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and many fine and medium irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate throughout; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); gradual wavy boundary.

   Btkn2--42 to 54 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores throughout; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and many fine and medium patchy soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate throughout; effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Btkn1, Btkn2 horizons - 20 to 75 cm)

   2C--54 to 152 cm; white (10YR 8/1) extremely gravelly sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).
