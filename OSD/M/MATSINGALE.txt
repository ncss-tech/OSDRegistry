MATSINGALE SERIES

The Matsingale series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in sodium affected lacustrine deposits. These soils occur on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Sodic Endoaquerts

TYPICAL PEDON: Matsingale silty clay, in shrubland on a slope of less than 1 percent at an elevation of 2013 meters (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

   E--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; moderate thin and medium platy structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 10 cm thick)

   Bss--5 to 47 cm; very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) silty clay, dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) dry; strong coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few slickensides with intersecting surfaces 10 to 60 degrees from horizontal; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

   Bssg--47 to 86 cm; dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) silty clay, gray (2.5Y 5/1) dry; 1 percent fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; strong coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common slickensides with intersecting surfaces 10 to 60 degrees from horizontal; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

   Bg--86 to 104 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; 1 percent fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; strong medium sub-angular blocky structure; very hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 50 cm thick)

   Cg--104 to 152 cm; olive gray (5Y 5/2) clay, light gray (5Y 7/2) dry; 1 percent fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
