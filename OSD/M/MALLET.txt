MALLET SERIES

The Mallet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from in mixed alluvium.  Mallet soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Mallet fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 5 to 10 percent of the surface is covered with gravel

     A--0 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

     Bw1--6 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

     Bw2--22 to 55 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 45 to 55 inches thick)

     Ck--55 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; 65 percent gravel and 5 percent cobble; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (4 to 8 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chaparral (I) (NM), Ima (NM), and Perilla (AZ) series. Chaparral soils are inactive. Perilla soils have secondary calcium carbonate above 30 inches.  Ima soils are in the Great Plains and are more moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June.  Chaparral soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mallet soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, and alluvial fans at elevations of 3,090 to 5,720 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed mixed alluvium. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altar, Hooks, Riveroad, and Guest soils. Altar soils are loamy-skeletal. Hooks soils are fine-loamy. Riveroad soils are fine-silty. Guest soils are fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mallet soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes grama grasses, Arizona cottontop, Mormon tea, snakeweed, burroweed and giant sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona and southern New Mexico.  Mallet soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA 41 and 42.
