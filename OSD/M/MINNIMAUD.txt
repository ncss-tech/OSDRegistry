MINNIMAUD SERIES

    The Minnimaud series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum from sedimentary rocks.  Minnimaud soils are on fan remnants and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Minnimaud channery loam, on a 50 percent convex-linear southeast facing slope in woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic;  many fine and very fine roots, common medium and coarse roots;  many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent channers, 5 percent cobbles and 2 percent flags; very slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated (1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--6 to 11 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine random tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 2 percent channers; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and as few thin coats on bottoms of rock fragments, (5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0);  abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 13 inches thick) 

    Bk1--11 to 24 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly clay loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; 75 percent weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure;  slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic;  common fine, very fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 15 percent paragravel; violently effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and also occur as many thin coats on bottom of rock fragments (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bk2--24 to 44 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) paragravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure ; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent paragravel and 5 percent channers; violently effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and as many thin coats around rock fragments, (40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (14 to 31 inches thick)

    Cr--44 to 54 inches; fractured shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beanlake (MT), Ipano (MT), Kiev (MT), Mudcree (UT), Osote (UT), Roundor (MT), and Zahl (ND) series.  Beanlake has a horizon with secondary gypsum accumulation and does not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches.  Ipano has a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Kiev, Osote and Zaul does not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches.  Mudcree and Roundor have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches in depth.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Minnimaud soils are at elevations of 6,800 to 8,400 feet.  Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  These soils occur on mountain slopes and fan remnants and formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum weathered from sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F. and the freeze-free period is 60 to 90 days.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, with wettest months in May to October and driest months in February to April.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Midfork, Patent, Podo, and Starman Variant soils and the tentative Sheepcan soil.  The Patent, Podo, Starman Variant, and Sheepcan (T) soils lack mollic epipedons.  The Podo soils are less than 20 inches deep.  The Midfork soils are loamy-skeletal and are in a cryic soil temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for woodland, rangeland, wildlife habitat and recreation.  The natural vegetation is dominantly Utah juniper, pinyon, locoweed, bluebunch wheatgrass, big sagebrush, bitterbrush, brome grass, and Indian paintbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Utah; LRR E, MLRA 48A; small extent.
