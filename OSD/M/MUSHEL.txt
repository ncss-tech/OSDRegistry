MUSHEL SERIES 

The Mushel series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in granitic or metamorphic residuum and/or colluvium with a thin volcanic ash mantle. They are on mountain slopes and ridges. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mushel soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 1,600 to 5,000 feet (488 to 1524 meters) with slopes of 5 to 75 percent. These soils are formed in residuum and/or colluvium from granite or metamorphic rocks with a thin volcanic ash mantle. The average annual temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F. and the average precipitation is 30 to 60 inches (762 to 1524 mm). The frost free season is 50 to 120 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brodeer, Brequito, and Bouldercreek series. Brodeer soils are on concave mountain side slopes and have a thick volcanic ash mantle. Brequito soils are on smooth mountain side slopes and have greater than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Bouldercreek soils are on steep concave north-facing mountain side slopes and are loamy-skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is western red cedar, grand fir, western larch, western white pine, Douglas- fir, and ponderosa pine, with an understory of queencup beadlily, coolwort foamflower, princes pine, western goldthread, bunchberry dogwood, and fools huckelberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Idaho.  Mushel soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.
