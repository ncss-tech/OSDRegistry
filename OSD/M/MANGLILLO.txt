TYPE LOCATION: Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. Approximately 3.7 miles southeast of Pole Ojea community, about 1.9 miles south on La Pitahaya road from the intersection of P.R. Hwy. 303, and about 300 feet west of road on wildlife habitat. USGS Cabo Rojo topographic quadrangle (1966); lat. 17 degrees 57 minutes 07 seconds N.; long. 67 degrees 08 minutes 04 seconds W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth of organic material: 46 to 99 centimeters (18 to 40 inches)
Depth to seasonally high water table: At or above the soil surface throughout the year
Soil Reaction: Moderately alkaline throughout
Oxidized pH:  Ultra to extremely acid
Sulfurous odor: Moderate to strong throughout and intensity decreases with depth
Fiber content: Fiber content dominantly ranges from 17 to 40 percent after rubbing, some pedons content rubbed fiber content above 40% (Peat)
Salinity: 32 to 36 parts per thousand

Range of individual horizons:
Oase horizon:
Color - hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, 5Y or N, value of 2.5, and chroma of 1; or it is neutral with value of 2.5.
Texture is muck.

Oese horizon:
Color - hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.
Texture is mucky peat. Can sometimes be peat (Oise)

Upper part of the 2Cg horizon:
Color - hue of 5Y or 10Y, value of 3, and chroma of 1.
Texture is mucky loam to mucky sand.

Lower part of the 2Cg horizon:
Color - hue of 10Y to 5GY, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1.
Content of pebbles range from 0 to less than 15 percent, by volume.
Texture is sandy loam to sand.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Coastal plains and Estuaries of the semiarid coastal plains MLRA 273
Landform: Mangrove swamps around sand bars along the coast 
Flooding: Very frequent flooding for very long duration (daily tides)
Parent material: They formed in decomposed organic material overlying regolith consisting in sand size shell fragments, quartz grains and subrounded volcanic fragments of recent beach deposits. 
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 29 degrees C. (84 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 813 millimeters (32 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Boquern, El Indio, Mar Negro, and Serrano are on similar or adjacent positions in the landscape:
-Boquern soils--are on similar to slightly higher positions on the coastal plain and are mineral throughout. 
-El Indio soils--occur on slightly higher sand bars and are sandy throughout. 
-Mar Negro soils--usually occur under red mangrove forests on the same landscape position but has a consistent root mat with hemic organic soil material throughout, sometimes you can reach mineral material after 150cm but more consistently it is after the described 203cm. 
-Serrano soils--are on slightly higher positions on the coastal plain and are also mineral throughout. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high to very high 
Flooding and ponding: This soil is subject to tides and inundated more than  of the day Flooding frequency and duration: Very frequent for very long duration from ocean tides

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses: Manglillo soils are used for wildlife habitat
Dominant vegetation: The vegetation consists of Red and White mangrove

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern semiarid coastal plains of Puerto Rico. The series is not extensive.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cabo Rojo Municipality, Puerto Rico; 2007. The name is from Manglillo beach, where it was originally recognized.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 
Histic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 61 cm (0 to 24 inches; Oase and Oese horizons).
Hemic soil material - the zone from 13 to 61 cm (5 to 24 inches)
Gleyed feature - the zone from 61 to 152 cm (24 to 60 inches; 2Cseg1 and 2Cseg2 horizons).
Sulfidic materials - the zone from 0 to 152 cm (0 to 60 inches)
Tidal / Brackish water above the surface for a very long duration of the day

These soils were formerly included in the tidal swamp miscellaneous land type.  These soils were formerly classified as Euic, isohyperthermic Fluvaquentic Haplohemists and updated to the twelfth edition of the Keys in June of 2022.
