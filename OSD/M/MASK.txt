MASK SERIES

The Mask series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Mask soils are on sideslopes of fan remnants and have slopes of 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mask soils are on sideslopes of fan remnants. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are 1,000 to 1,700 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 69 to 74 degrees F.and the frost-free season is 300 to 360 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carrizo and Clegorpass soils. Clegorpass soils have argillic horizons. Carrizo soils do not have calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low or medium runoff; moderately rapid over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.
