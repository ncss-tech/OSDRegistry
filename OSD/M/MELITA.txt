MELITA SERIES

The Melita series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy materials overlying loamy materials on ground moraines, outwash plains, lake plains and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Alfic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Melita sand, on a 4 percent slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Bhs--25 to 33 cm (10 to 13 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; slightly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [0 to 13 cm (5 inches) thick]

 Bs--33 to 48 cm (13 to 19 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bw--48 to 112 cm (19 to 44 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; moderately acid; clear irregular boundary. [0 to 76 cm (30 inches) thick]

 2B/E--112 to 122 cm (44 to 48 inches); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) loam (Bt); occupies about 85 percent of the horizon surrounded by reddish gray (5YR 5/2) sandy loam (E); weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 2Bt--122 to 137 cm (48 to 54 inches); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; few tongues of reddish gray (5YR 5/2) of E material; about 2 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) thick]

 2C--137 to 152 cm (54 to 60 inches); reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) loam; weak medium platy fragments; friable; about 3 percent limestone gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Keweenaw, Leelanau, Mancelona, and Southwells series. Keweenaw, Leelanau, Mancelona, and Southwells soils average more than 52 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Melita soils are on ground moraines, outwash plains, lake plains, and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. The Melita soils formed in sandy materials overlying loamy materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 838 mm (26 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F). Mean summer temperature ranges from 15.6 to 19.4 degrees C (60 to 67 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Gres, Kalkaska, Menominee, Roscommon, Rubicon, and Tawas soils. The excessive drained Rubicon, Kalkaska, and the well drained Menominee soils are common associates. The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils and the very poorly drained Roscommon and Tawas soils are wet associates.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy horizons and moderately high in the lower loamy horizons. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy horizons and moderately slow in the lower loamy horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION: Melita soils are used for cropland and woodland. Corn, grass-legume hay, oats, and wheat are the principal crops. Timber is largely second growth sugar maple. Common trees are American basswood, American beech, quaking aspen, sugar maple, and yellow birch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 94B, 94C, and 98 in the northern Lower Peninsula and eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This series is of moderate extent.
