Used mainly for pasture and range.  A few areas are used for field crops and truck crops.  The native vegetation is primarily a mixture of Andropogon and Paspalum species with some sedges.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included with Addicks, Clodine, and Morey soils. Classification has been changed to reflect an argillic horizon found in the field and documented in the laboratory.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 61 to 111 cm (12 to 32 in). (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons) 

Mollic epipedon -0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in) (Ap and A horizons)
Argillic horizons- 61 cm to 203 cm (24 to 80 in) (Btk horizons)

Additional Comments: Fine-silty family and CEC/Clay class are supported by lab data.
