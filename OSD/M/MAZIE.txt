MAZIE SERIES

The Mazie series consists of very deep, very poorly drained  soils on flood plains and bottomlands.  They formed in material weathered from mixed alluvium.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquandic Endoaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mazie ashy silt loam, pasture; on a concave slope of 1 percent at 2860 feet elevation.  When described on October 17, 1983, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

(6 to 9 inches thick)

    AB--7 to 11 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) ashy silt loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; many fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

(7 to 9 inches thick)

    Btg--20 to 38 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/3) silty clay, pale olive (5Y 6/3) moist; ped surfaces are gray (5Y 5/1) when moist; many fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations and dark greenish gray (5G 4/1) moist redox depletions; moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    2Cg1--38 to 42 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; many fine and medium prominent pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist redox concentrations, and light olive gray (5Y 6/2), and dark greenish gray (5G 4/1) moist redox depletions; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    3Cg2--42 to 50 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/3) silty clay loam, pale olive (5Y 6/3) moist; many medium and large prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations and dark greenish gray (5G 4/1) moist redox depletions; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 9 inches thick)

    3Cg3--50 to 60 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) silty clay loam, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; common fine and medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist redox concentrations; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mazie soils are on lower positions of flood plains and bottomlands.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from mixed alluvium.  Elevations range from 2800 to 3000 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 40 to 45 inches, and frost-free season is from 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clarkia, Helmer, Hobnail, Pokey, Reggear, and Sly soils.  Clarkia soils are on higher positions of flood plains and are fine-silty.  Helmer and Reggear soils are on terraces, and have a fragipan and are moderately well drained.  Hobnail soils are on higher terraces and are moderately well drained.  Pokey soils are along drainageways, and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and somewhat poorly drained.  Sly soils are on higher terraces and are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  very poorly drained; very slow runoff; slow permeability; frequently flooded for long periods from February through May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for hay and pasture, wetland wildlife habitat, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is mainly western river alder, Douglas hawthorne, Nebraska sedge, tufted hairgrass, gland cinquefoil, common camas, and rush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  This soil is not extensive.
