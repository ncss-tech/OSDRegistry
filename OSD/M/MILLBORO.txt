MILLBORO SERIES

The Millboro series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed from clayey sediments weathered from marine shale of the Pierre Shale Formation.  Millboro soils are on undulating upland plains in the Northern and Southern Rolling Pierre Shale Plains, MLRA's 63A and 63B.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 millimeters (18 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Haplusterts

Soil Moisture Control Section: 

The soil moisture control section is moist in some parts from April to July; intermittently moist from October to March; driest in August and September; typic ustic moisture regime.

Mean Annual Soil Temperature:  8 to 11 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F)

COMPETING SERIES:  
Currently Goessel is the only competing series.  Goessel has a warmer mean annual soil temperature and a wetter soil moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material:  clayey sediments weathered from Pierre Shale 
Landscape:  nearly level to rolling uplands
Landform:  gently sloping to undulating plains
Slope:  0 to 15 percent
Slope shape:  plane to convex
Mean annual air temperature:  6 to 10 degrees C (43 to 50 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  400 to 700 millimeters (16 to 28 inches) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Boro, Lakoma, Reliance, Witten and McClure soils.  Boro and Lakoma soils have convex slopes and are above the Millboro soils.  Boro soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Lakoma soils have shale between depths of 50 and 100 centimeters (about 20 to 40 inches).  Reliance and McClure have plane slopes on tablelands above the Millboro soils and contain less clay.  Witten soils are in swales.   

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage:  well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  moderately low
Runoff:  medium to very high depending on slope

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Mostly cropped to winter wheat, corn grain sorghum and alfalfa.  Native vegetation mainly is western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, blue grama, and sideoats grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  
South-central South Dakota.  It is mapped extensively in MLRA's 63A and 63B and also in MLRA 66.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 33 centimeters (13 inches, this includes the Ap, A and Bt1 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 18 to 48 centimeters (7 to 19 inches, this includes the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); slickensides - the zone form 48 to 91 centimeters (19 to 36 inches, this includes the Bkss1 and Bkss2 horizons).
