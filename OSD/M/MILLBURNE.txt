COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Chivers (UT) series.
Chivers soils have endosaturation at depths of 1.5 to 3.5 feet throughout the year and have a typic ustic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: strath terraces, outwash terraces
Parent material: outwash
Elevation: 2,042 to 2,286 meters (6,700 to 7,500 feet)
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 229 to 381 millimeters (9 to 15 inches)
Mean annual air temperature: 3.9 to 6.1 degrees C (39 to 43 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
These are the Urie soils. Urie soils occur on similar landforms as Millburne and have loamy-skeletal control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained due to surface irrigation.  Permeability is moderate in the solum, slow or very slow in the 2Bk horizon, and very rapid in the lower part. Runoff is negligible to low.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally as irrigated hayland and pasture.  The historical native plant community is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, needleandthread, bluebunch wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution limited to the southwestern part of Wyoming.  MLRA 34A. The series is of small extent.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Uinta County Area, Wyoming, 1964.  Series name taken from a small town in Uinta County.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches) (A, Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon: from 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) (Bt horizon)
Calcic horizon: from 30 to 203 cm (12 to 40 inches) (Bk1, Bk2, 2Bk2, 2Bk3, 2Bk4 horizons). The calcic horizon is not a hard indurated petrocalcic horizon, it is not continuously cemented. It is a discontinuous layer that consists of cemented materials that offer a distinct resistance to digging implements and water movement. It has irregular thickness and cementation characteristics. The cemented parts range from extremely weakly to strongly cemented. This horizon is similar to the partially cementated horizons in the Petronodic subgroups of Aridisols.
Oxyaquic feature: episaturation and redoximorphic concentrations in the 10 to 30 cm layer (4 to 12 inches) (Bt horizon). Saturation is entirely from surface irrigation. Because the irrigation has caused redox features in the pedon, the wetness was considered part of the soil that is classified.
Particle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 30 cm (4 to 10 inches) (entire argillic horizon)
Series control section: the zone from 0 to 200 cm.

The solum is assumed to contain some carbonates added from irrigation water.

The 6/2011 revision moves the type location to a pedon that represents the series concept that was developed during the initial soil survey of the Uinta County Area, 2003 to 2010. This series was originally a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed Borollic Haplargids; then was updated to fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Calciargids. The 06/2011 revision changes the classification to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Argiustolls.

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon was sampled for NSSL, soil survey sample number S06WY041-004.
