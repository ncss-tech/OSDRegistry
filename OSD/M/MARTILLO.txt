MARTILLO SERIES

The Martillo series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in clayey alluvium.  They are on broad upland alluvial flats and fan skirts.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Martillo soils are on broad alluvial flats and fan skirts in a mountain and bolson landscape.  Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent, but range up to 3 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium predominantly from tuffaceous materials.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kinco, Potrillo, and Stovall series. Kinco soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section and are on gently sloping upland plains.  Potrillo soils have less than 20 percent clay in the control section and are on undulating ridges and fans.  Stovall soils have between 18 and 35 percent clay in the control section and are on nearly level to gently sloping upland plains, valleys and alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is medium on slopes less than 1 percent, and high on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  Overland flow may occur once in 7 to 20 years for a duration of less than 2 days.  When overland flow occurs it is usually in the months of July through September.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is mainly drought tolerant short to mid grasses such as tobosa, vine mesquite, blue grama, cane bluestem, sideoats grama, alkali sacaton, and sand muhly.  Woody species consist mainly of mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West Texas. MLRA 42.  The series is of minor extent.
