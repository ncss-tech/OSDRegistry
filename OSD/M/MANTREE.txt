MANTREE SERIES

The Mantree series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from andesitic tuff breccia over residuum weathered from intrusive igneous rock. The Mantree soils are on mountainflanks and mountaintops below lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1240 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Wyntoon (MLRAs 21 and 22B) soils. Wyntoon soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks are on hills or fan remnants, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mantree soils are on mountainflanks and mountaintops below lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from andesitic tuff breccia over residuum weathered from intrusive igneous rock. Elevation is 850 to 1300 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1100 to 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. The frost free season is 190 to 215 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devilsnose, Holland, Lilygap, Musick, Redapple and Wukusick soils. Devilsnose, Lilygap and Redapple all occur on lahars. Devilsnose and Lilygap are medial in the upper part of the control section. Devilsnose soils occur on the middle to upper portions of mountainflanks and Lilygap soils occur on the lower portions. Redapple soils are fine and are on stable summits and backslopes. Holland, Musick and Wukusick occur on similar landform positions and also formed in  intrusive igneous bedrock, but lack low bulk densities with oxalate-extractable Al+1/2Fe greater than 1.0 percent in the surface horizons. Holland soils occur on high hills, mountain slopes and canyons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, recreation and limited homesite development. Vegetation is Douglas fir, white fir, pacific yew, sugar pine, ponderosa pine, incense cedar, California black oak, deerbrush, whiteleaf manzanita, greenleaf manzanita, gray pinemat manzanita, and mountain misery.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. The series is not extensive.
