GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Bohicket, Carteret, Fort Caswell, Fort Fisher, Newhan, Prices Creek, Showboat, Sunny Point, and Yaupon soils.
Bohicket soils--are on broad level tidal marsh flats bordering the Atlantic Ocean and formed in silty and clayey marine sediments.
Carteret soils--are on back-barrier island tidal marshes of the Atlantic Coast and formed in sandy marine deposits.
Fort Caswell soils--are on high-energy submerged wave-cut platforms and shoals formed in sandy estuarine deposits throughout.
Fort Fisher soils--are in barrier coves and submerged wave-cut platforms fluctuating from low to high energy formed from sandy over loamy intermixed estuarine deposits and have lithologic discontinuities within 100 centimeters of the soil surface.
Newhan soils--are on gently undulating dunes commonly near beaches and waterways, do not have water at or near the soil surface, and formed in sand and shelly eolian deposits along the Atlantic Coast.
Prices Creek soils--are in lower energy estuarine tidal streams and formed in fine-loamy estuarine deposits.
Showboat soils--are in mainland coves and estuarine tidal streams formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and contain 40 centimeters of buried organic soil material within 200 centimeters of the soil surface. 
Sunny Point soils--are on lower energy shoals and mainland coves and formed in coarse-loamy estuarine deposits and contain at least 15 centimeters of sulfidic materials within the top 50 centimeters of the soil.
Yaupon soils--are constructed from dredge-deposit spoil on the Lower Coastal Plain and consist of fine textured soil material.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class--Subaqueous (permanently submerged)
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity--Moderately high to high
Soil Moisture Regime--Peraquic

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming. Some areas are actively harvested for crabs.
Vegetation--Extremely limited and isolated stands of shoal grass (Halodule wrightii), widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), and Saltwater Eelgrass (Zostera marina) exist in lower energy areas with low turbidity that allow for establishment.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Coastal plain estuaries in North Carolina
Region--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
Extent--Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brunswick County, North Carolina, 2024

REMARKS: 
Molasses Creek is derived from the creek adjacent to where this soil was first observed on the landward side of Oak Island, west by northwest of Oak Island Lighthouse

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022)--

n-value > 0.7--0 to 197 centimeters (0 to 78 inches), placing these soils taxonomically into the Grossic Hydrowassents subgroup. 
Reduced Matrix--0 to 197 centimeters (0 to 78 inches); soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but undergoes a change in hue or chroma within 30 minutes after the soil material has been exposed to air.
Endosaturation--0 to 197 centimeters (0 to 78 inches) 
Peraquic feature-Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface.
