MUDSPRINGS SERIES

The Mudsprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils, formed in slope alluvium from metamorphic and sedimentary rock, with moderate to high silica content.  Mudsprings soils are on hill slopes, escarpments or outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 10 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm (14 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C (43 F).

Paynecanal (T) soils are on similar positions and have a calcic horizon.  Ironco soils are on similar positions and do not have horizons of secondary carbonates.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to high runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mudsprings soils are primarily used for grazing as native rangeland.  Native vegetation consists of Birchleaf mountain mahogany, Utah serviceberry, Common snowberry, Bonneville big sagebrush, Bluebunch wheatgrass, Western wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, and Yellow rabbitbrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah mountains; LRR E, MLRA 47, LRU 47C; The Series is of small extent.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, Utah, 2015.  The series name was coined from a local landform Mud Spring Draw.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile are:
Particle Size Control Section:  25 to 72 cm depth.  (Bt1 and Bt2)
Mollic epipedon:  0 to 25 cm depth.  (A1 and A2)
Argillic horizon:  25 to 72 cm depth.  (Bt1 and Bt2)
Secondary carbonates:  118 to 152 cm depth.  (Bk1 and Bk2) 
(Carbonates do not meet the requirements for a calcic horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
