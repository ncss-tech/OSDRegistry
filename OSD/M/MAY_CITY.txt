MAY CITY SERIES

The May City series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in gravelly and loamy sediments.  These soils occur on convex side slopes on glaciated uplands and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 725 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: May City sandy clay loam, on a 3 percent slope, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 430 meters above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; about 11 percent gravel, about 3 percent fine shale fragments; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (15 to 36 centimeters thick) 

 Bw1--18 to 30 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) with streaks and pockets of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy clay loam; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; friable; about 9 percent gravel, about 2 percent fine shale fragments; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 Bw2--30 to 48 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly sandy loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; about 25 percent gravel, about 2 percent fine shale fragments; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 25 to 40 centimeters.)

 C4--135 to 170 centimeters; mixed strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) and yellowish red (5YR 5/6) extremely gravelly sandy loam; massive; very friable; few white (10YR 8/1) calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; about 63 percent gravel, about 2 percent fine shale fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. 

 C5--170 to 200 centimeters; mixed yellowish red (5YR 4/6) and red (2.5YR 4/6) extremely gravelly sandy loam; massive; very friable; about 60 percent gravel, about 15 percent cobbles, about 2 percent fine shale fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--gravelly and loamy sediments

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Afton, Everly, Roine, and Wilmonton soils.
Afton--are on lower landscape positions in upland drainageways and are frequently saturated within 0.3 meters of the surface during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Everly--are on landscape positions similar to that of May City soils and have a rock fragment content of less than 15 percent in the series control section
Roine--are on landscape positions similar to that of May City soils and have a rock fragment content of less than 8 percent in the series control section
Wilmonton--are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a rock fragment content of less than 8 percent rock fragments in the series control section

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage--somewhat excessively drained-a frequently saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest part of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--10 to 100 micrometers per second

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans, but some areas are in permanent pasture due to coarse fragments on the surface. Some small areas are excavated as a source of gravel. Native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clay County, Iowa, 2002.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 centimeters (Ap horizon);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 18 to 48 centimeters (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

This soil was previously included with Kanaranzi, variant. 

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
