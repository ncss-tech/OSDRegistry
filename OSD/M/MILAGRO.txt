MILAGRO SERIES

The Milagro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitoid rock. The Milagro soils are on alluvial fans and fan skirts. Slope is 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 152 mm (6 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C. (64 degrees F.).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing soils at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Milagro soils are on alluvial fans and fan skirts. Slope is 0 to 1 percent.  The Milagro soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitoid rock. Elevations are 89 to 158 meters (290 to 515 feet). The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 127 to 178 mm (5 to 7 inches). The mean annual temperature is 17 to 18 degrees C. (62 to 65 degrees F.). Mean July temperature is about 29 degrees C. (85 degrees F.), and mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.). The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bakersfield, Granoso, Kimberlina, Vineland, Wasco soils. Bakersfield soils on flood plains have a mollic epipedon. Granoso soils on alluvial fans and flood plains are Torripsamments with no particle-size class. Kimberlina soils on flood plains and recent alluvial fans have a calcareous mineralogy class. Vineland soils on flood plains and deltas have a sandy particle-size class. Wasco soils on recent alluvial fans and floodplains formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from igneous and/or sedimentary rock sources and have a regular decrease in organic matter.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are subject to rare flooding but are protected by dams, water diversions and levees.

USE AND VEGETATION: Milagro soils are used for irrigated cropland and home site development. Commonly grown crops are cotton, onions, carrots, lettuce, cabbage, grapes, dry beans, and many other fruits and vegetables. Native vegetation is annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern San Joaquin Valley of California, MRLA 17. The series is moderately extensive.
