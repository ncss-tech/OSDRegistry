MAQUAM SERIES

The Maquam series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils that are permanently submerged. They formed in organic soil materials overlying sandy and loamy lacustrine and deltaic sediments along shorelines and littoral zones in freshwater ponds and lakes. Maquam soils are on low-energy shorelines and other subaqueous landforms that receive relatively mild wave action and are not subject to strong currents. Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid in the organic materials over moderate to rapid in the underlying mineral material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, mesic Sapric Frasiwassists

TYPICAL PEDON: Maquam muck, on a 1 percent slope, in a freshwater bay under about 0.75 meters of water. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) (Pedon: S2013VT001-002)

    Oa1 -- 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) muck; massive; very friable; few fine live roots; clear boundary.

    Oa2 --15 to 36 cm (6 to 14 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) muck; massive; very friable; few fine live roots; clear boundary.

    Oa3 -- 36 to 51 cm (14 to 20 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) muck; massive; very friable; few fine live roots; clear boundary.

    Oa4 -- 51 to 104 cm (20 to 41 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) muck; massive; very friable; few very fine live roots; gradual boundary. 

    C1 -- 104 to 119 cm (41 to 47 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam; massive; friable; many coarse faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) iron depletions; few woody fragments; ; clear boundary.

    Cg2 -- 119 to 155 cm (47 to 61 inches); dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) silt loam; massive; friable; many medium distinct gray (N 5/) iron depletions; common thin lenses of woody fragments.

TYPE LOCATION: Franklin County, Vermont, Town of Highgate, in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain, latitude 44.9785 degrees N. and longitude 73.1427 degrees W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and thickness of overlying organic material ranges from 18 to 51 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the O horizon and extremely acid to slightly acid in the underlying C horizons. The content of woody fragments, rock fragments, and shell fragments in individual horizons of the particle-size control section ranges from 0 to 2 percent. 

The O horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3. It is moderately to highly decomposed plant material. 

The C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture ranges from sand to silt loam. Horizons identified as C horizons (rather than Cg horizons) are considered to have aquic conditions, but do not meet color requirement of value of 4 or more for reduced, depleted, or gleyed matrices.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maquam soils are on low-energy shorelines, bays, coves, and other subaqueous landforms that receive relatively mild wave action and are not subject to strong currents. They formed in organic soil material overlying sandy to loamy deltaic and lacustrine sediment. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 48 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the tentative freshwater subaqueous Alburg, Knightspoint, and Shoreham series formed in mineral soil material. Alburg soils are formed in silty and clayey lacustrine sediments on low-energy bay bottoms and other low-energy subaqueous landforms. Knightspoint soils are formed in loamy lacustrine and deltaic sediments on mixed-energy subaqueous landforms such as shorelines and littoral zones, stream outlets, and shoals. Shoreham soils are formed in sandy lacustrine and deltaic sediments on high-energy subaqueous landforms that receive relatively strong wave action or are subject to stronger currents, including shorelines and littoral zones, stream outlets, and shoals.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Subaqueous. The soil is permanently submerged. Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid in the organic materials and moderate to rapid in the underlying mineral material.

USE AND VEGETATION: 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  New England, New York, possibly Pennsylvania; MLRAs 142, 144A, 144B, and 145. The series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Amherst, Massachusetts. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Tentative series, proposed in Franklin County, Vermont, 2013. 

REMARKS: Climate info in the introductory paragraph is from Burlington, Vermont, and is estimated for Geographic Setting section. 

Taxonomic Class:  Euic, mesic (Terric) Sapric Frasiwassists (tentative classification - Terric and Terric Sapric subgroups are needed for Frasiwassists
