MIJOYSEE SERIES

Mijoysee series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Mijoysee soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Mijoysee extremely gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 5 percent stones, 20 percent cobbles and 40 percent gravel. 

 A--0 to 7 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common fine and medium interstitial and common very fine vesicular pores; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); violently effervescent; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 7 cm thick) 

 Bk--7 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; common distinct, medium (2 to 5 mm thick) concretions of secondary calcium carbonate on bottom of rock fragments; 50 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); violently effervescent; abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick) 

 R--15 cm; indurated limestone and dolomite. 

TYPE LOCATION: White Pine County, Nevada; In Cathedral Canyon, about 1.5 miles northeast of Green Springs; approximately 250 feet south and 1,750 feet west of the northeast corner of section 23, T. 15 N., R. 57 E; USGS Mount Hamilton 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 9 minutes 21.03 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 31 minutes and 30.66 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.1558417 latitude, -115.5251833 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring months, dry in late summer and fall; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 10 to 20 cm. 
Reaction: Slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.
Carbonates: Calcareous in all parts, violently effervescent. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 35 to 45 percent in the less than 2 mm fraction. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 50 to 75 percent; includes gravel and cobbles.

A horizon
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4, dry or moist.

Bk horizon 
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Loam or sandy loam.
Structure: Weak or moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky.
Consistence: Nonsticky or slightly sticky, and nonplastic or slightly plastic wet.
Other features: Secondary calcium carbonate concretions and masses are on the bottom of rock fragments. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Highams and Hopeka series. 

Highams soils have a depth to bedrock of greater than 25 cm and have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Hopeka soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and lack a Bk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mijoysee soils are on mountains and hills. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,650 to 2,450 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 350 mm; the mean annual temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free season is 70 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Hyzen, Pookaloo, Tecomar, and Zimbob series. Hyzen soils have a 15 to 36 cm thick mollic epipedon. Pookaloo and Tecomar soils are deeper than 25 cm to bedrock and contain 13 to 48 cm thick calcic horizons in the soil profile. Zimbob soils have less than 50 percent rock fragments in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high to very high runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation includes little-leaf mountain mahogany, black sagebrush, and Sandberg's bluegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
