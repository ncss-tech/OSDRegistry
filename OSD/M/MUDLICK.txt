MUDLICK SERIES

The Mudlick series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on mountain sides in MLRA 116C. They formed in colluvium and residuum from diorite. Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, and mean annual preciptation is about 46 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Paleudults

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mudlick soils are on mountain sides. Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from diorite. The mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Killarney, Irondale, and Trackler soils. Killarney soils are loamy-skeletal, have fragipans, and are on mountain sides. Irondale soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep, and are on mountain sides. Trackler soils are moderately well drained, deep, and are on mountain tops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Surface runoff is moderate to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for woodland. Native vegetation is oak-hickory forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The St. Francois mountains region of the Missouri Ozarks (MLRA 116C). The series is of minor extent.
