SERIES ESTABLISHED: Colorado County, Texas; 1997. The Mentz series is named after the community of Mentz located in the northeast part of Colorado County.

REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped in the Telferner and Edna series. The series was updated in 2018 and classification was changed from thermic to hyperthermic as a result of a soil temperature study; Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs was changed to Vertic Chromic Hapldudalfs based on soil moisture studies on similar soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: 41 to 168 cm (16 to 66 in) (Bt and BCtk horizons)
Vertic feature: clayey with high shrink-swell, pressures surfaces, slickensides and wedge-shaped aggregates at a depth of 51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in).
Secondary carbonates: 122 to 203 cm (48 to 80 in) (Btk, BCtk, BCk1, BCk2 horizons)

Additional Comments: Further study on the mineralogy of these soils is needed.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Survey Office lab data exists on pedon S1996TX089007 at the series type location.
