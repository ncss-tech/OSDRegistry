MEDORA SERIES

The Medora series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess, loamy material and a paleosol in outwash on eskers and crevasse fillings. They are moderately deep or shallow to a fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Fragiudults

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jennings and Spickert series. Jennings and Spickert soils have less than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Medora soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of eskers and crevasse fillings. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. They formed in 30 to 91 cm (12 to 36 inches) of loess, loamy material, and the underlying paleosol in outwash considered to be of pre-Illinoian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 190 days. Elevation is 122 to 259 meters (400 to 850 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Avonburg, Dubois, Haubstadt, Nabb, Negley, and Parke soils. The somewhat poorly drained Avonburg and the moderately well drained Nabb are on summits and shoulders of till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Dubois and the moderately well drained Haubstadt soils are on flats, summits and shoulders of lake plains. The well drained, more permeable Negley soils are on backslopes. The well drained, more permeable Parke soils are on similar landform positions as the Medora soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. In non-eroded to moderately eroded soils, the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) in normal years. In severely eroded soils, the depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are being used to grow corn, soybeans, and wheat. Some areas are for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 114A in southeastern Indiana. This series is of small extent.
