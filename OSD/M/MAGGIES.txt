Danacove soils--have less clay throughout and are in barrier coves and barrier cove channels within the estuary

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Fine-loamy estuarine deposits 
Landscape--Coastal plain estuaries and lagoons
Landform--Lagoon bottoms and mainland coves

SERIES PROPOSED: Brazoria County, Texas, 2022. The name is from a geographic location on Galveston Island (Maggies Cove).

REMARKS: The series was formerly included with water.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section--0 to 100 cm (00 to 40 in) 
Ochric epipedon--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (Ag horizon) 
Peraquic feature--0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) (Ag horizon and Cg layers are permanently saturated)

Additional Comments--Mineralogy and activity class based on adjacent subaerial soils with similar texture and parent material.

ADDITIONAL DATA: MLRA Soil Survey Office lab data on pedon, S2020TX0399105 from series type location.
