MARLEAN SERIES

The Marlean series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 20 to 50 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) of loamy glacial or eolian sediments and in the underlying loamy residuum from limestone bedrock. These soils are on ridges, interfluves, and side slopes on dissected uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Marlean loam, on a south-facing, convex slope of about 4 percent, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--15 to 23 centimeters (6 to 9 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine granular; friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 13 to 30 centimeters (5 to 12 inches).]

 Bw--23 to 30 centimeters (9 to 12 inches); mixed very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and brown (10YR 4/3) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) thick]

 2C--30 to 203 centimeters (12 to 80 inches); mixed very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3), and brown (10YR 4/3) very flaggy loam; massive; friable; about 45 percent rock fragments, mostly flagstones with about 15 percent channers; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.
