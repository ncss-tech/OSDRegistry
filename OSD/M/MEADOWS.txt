MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pittsylvania County, Virginia, 1989.

REMARKS: This soil exhibits considerable variability in the degree of weathering of the rock fragments and the Cr horizon. In some areas the gravel in the loamy horizons breaks down under laboratory particle size analysis. The dark colors in the solum are inherited from the parent material.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Umbric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 9 inches (the Ap and Bw horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone 4 to 9 inches (Bw horizon)
Paralithic contact--the contact at a depth of 16 inches (Cr horizon)
Paralithic materials--the zone from 16 to 24 inches (Cr horizon)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 24 inches
