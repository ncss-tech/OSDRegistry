MUNTERVILLE SERIES

The Munterville series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 5 to 50 centimeters of silty or loamy materials and in the underlying residuum from brown and gray acid Pennsylvanian shale. These soils are on convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams. Slope ranges from 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 millimeters.

SERIES PROPOSED: Wapello County, Iowa, 2009.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 20 to 70 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 centimeters (A and E horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 20 centimeters (E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 86 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
paralithic contact--the contact with clayey shale at a depth of 191 centimeters (2Cr horizon);
udic moisture regime.

The geological origin of the mantle is variable. It may be silty materials such as loess, or loamy sediments derived from till, and the underlying residuum from interbedded shale, limestone, lignite, or sandstone.

Drainage class is difficult to assess because of the color inherited from the shale.

The gray colors in the lower half of the series control section are inherited from the shale and were not considered in classification of the series.  The extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  However, available data indicate that the clay mineralogy typically is mixed and the particle-size class is fine family.

The platy structure in the 2C horizon is inherited from the shale parent material and is not a result of pedogenic processes.
