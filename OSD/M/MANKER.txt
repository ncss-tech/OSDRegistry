GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alterationcreek, Fields, Haggardcreek, Rocklake, Tiekel, and Uranatina series. 
Alterationcreek soils are well drained, have bedrock at a depth between 101 and 154 cm (40 and 61 in), and occur on hillslopes and mountain valleys.
Fields soils are well drained, have umbric epipedons, lithic contacts within 2 m (79 in) of the soil surface, and occur on mountains.
Haggardcreek soils are well drained, has a folistic epipedon, there is bedrock within 2 meters of the soil surface, and occur on hillslopes and mountain slopes.
Rocklake soils are less than 50cm deep to bedrock and occur on occur on escarpments and ridges on mountain sides
Tiekel soils are very poorly drained, have histic epipedons, cobbles and gravels in the O horizons, and occur in outwash plains and lake plains. 
Uranatina soils are well drained, have mottles in Bw and C horizons, and occur on outwash plains and glacial lakes.
