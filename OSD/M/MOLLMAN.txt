MOLLMAN SERIES 

The Mollman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy till or colluvium.  These soils are on moraines, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mollman gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 2 inches thick)
