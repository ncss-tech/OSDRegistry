MAXMORE SERIES

The Maxmore series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loess and the underlying glacial till. Maxmore soils are on heads of drainageways and on toe slopes in uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (A1, A2, Btg1, Btg2 and Btg3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 51 centimeters (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from 51 to 127 centimeters (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons);
aquic subgroup--low chroma in zone from 51 to 66 centimeters (Btg1 horizon);
aquic moisture regime.

The Btg horizon does not meet the 1.2 percent increase in clay requirement for an argillic horizon;

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
