MULDOON SERIES



The Muldoon series consists of deep to duripan, well drained soils that

formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Muldoon

soils are on fan terraces and footslopes to mountains and have slopes

of 2 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average

annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual

temperature is about 42 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Ultic Argixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Muldoon loam - on a 10 percent slope at an elevation of

5,500 feet in rangeland.  When described on November 7, 1979, the soil

was moist to 12 inches and dry below.  (Colors are for dry soil unless

otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown

(10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable,

slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many very fine and fine roots,

many very fine and fine interstitial pores, slightly acid (pH 6.2);

clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)



    A2--3 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3)

moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; many

very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; few thin clay films

on ped faces; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 7

inches thick)



    Bt1--7 to 11 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark

brown (10YR 3/3) moist, weak fine and medium subangular blocky

structure; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic, many very fine, fine

and medium roots; many fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on

ped faces; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 7 inches

thick)



    Bt2--11 to 22 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark

yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky

structure; hard, friable, very sticky and plastic, common fine and

medium roots; many fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films

on ped faces and lining pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth

boundary.  (8 to 13 inches thick)



    Bt3--22 to 32 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark

yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure;

very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium

roots; common very fine tubular pores; many thick clay films on ped

faces and lining pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (7

to 22 inches thick)



    Bt4--32 to 45 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam;

dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky

structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots;

few very fine tubular pores; about 5 percent gravel; common moderately

thick clay films on ped faces and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear

smooth boundary.  (0 to 13 inches thick)



    2Bqm--45 to 56 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) indurated

duripan dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; few very fine

tubular pores; weakly cemented plates; cemented with silica (veins of

silica within plates about 1 to 4 mm thick); neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Carmack, Elkcreek, Johnson,

Molyneux, Simonton, Suloaf, and Trojan series.  Carmack, Johnson, and

Suloaf have O horizons and occur in a precipitation zone wetter than 16

inches.  Carmack soils have moderately acid argillic horizons.

Elkcreek soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Johnson, Molyneux, and

Simonton have more than 30 percent fine sand and coarser.  Trojan soils

are dry more than 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.

Molyneux soils have more than 5 percent gravel in the upper part of the

argillic.  Suloaf soils have gravelly textures in the upper part of the

argillic horizon.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Muldoon soils are on fan terraces and foot slopes

to mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges

from 4,800 to 6,500 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium from mixed

igneous and metamorphic rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 12

to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The

average annual temperature is 40 degrees to 44 degrees F.  The frost

free season is 60 to 90 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Peevywell, Goodington,

Starhope, Smelter, and Molyneux soils.  Peevywell soils have a duripan

at a depth of 24 to 35 inches.  Goodington, Smelter, and Starhope soils

have an abrupt increase in clay.  Goodington soils are on lava plains.

Starhope soils are 20 to 40 inches deep.  Smelter soils have fine silty

control sections.  Starhope and Smelter soils occur on foothills and

mountainsides.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is slow to medium.

Permeability is moderately slow.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Vegetation is Mountain

big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Nevada bluegrass,

and needlegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Idaho.  These soils are

inextensive.
