MOLINARO SERIES

The Molinaro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from noncalcareous sandstone and shale.  Molinaro soils are on terraces, valley floors, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Molinaro loam, on a south facing, convex, 5 percent slope in grass at an elevation of 7,100 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on September 9, 1981 the soil was moist from 0 to 41 inches.

    A1--0 to 17 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

    A2--17 to 31 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw--31 to 41 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk--41 to 66 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; few fine filaments of lime; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (A1, A2, and part of the Bw horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 41 inches.  (A1, A2, Bw horizons)
Other features:  
  secondary carbonates from 31 to 66 inches. (Bw and Bk horizons)
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
