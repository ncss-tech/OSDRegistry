MCKENTON SERIES 

The McKenton series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in saline and sodic alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on plains, flood-plain steps, stream terraces and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.
