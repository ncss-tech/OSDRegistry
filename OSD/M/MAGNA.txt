MAGNA SERIES

The Magna series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Magna soils are on flood plains and low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Magna soils occur on smooth to undulating flood plains, lake plains, and low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 5,800 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium and reworked lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chipman and Ironton soils. Chipman soils are fine-silty.  Ironton soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very high surface runoff; slow or very slow permeability (low to moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 2 feet (very shallow to moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between April and August.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Drained phases are recognized.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for long periods between April and June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Magna soils are used for pasture, irrigated cropland, and industrial development.  The native vegetation is inland saltgrass, wiregrass, sedges, quackgrass, and foxtail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 6,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Salt Lake County, Utah, 1969.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 12 inches (Ag1 and Ag2 horizons).

Calcic horizon - The zone from 12 to 28 inches (Bkg horizon).

Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 24 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Ag1, Ag2, and Bkg horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bkg and Agb horizons and parts of the Ag2 and Cg1 horizon).


This revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciaquolls based on lab data for adjacent soils and property data in NASIS.

Magna soils in the soil survey of Box Elder County, Utah, Eastern Part (UT602) are a taxadjunct to the series because they are drier in the upper part of the profile and classify as Fine, mixed, active, mesic Aeric Calciaquolls.
