MALARGO SERIES

The Malargo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium high in lime and gypsum on fan piedmonts and broad alluvial basins. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, gypsic, thermic Ustic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON: Malargo gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A--0 to 4 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); 30 percent pebbles as desert pavement; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

	By1--4 to 11 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine  roots; common very fine pores; few fine masses of gypsum; 2 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

	By2--11 to 25 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;  common very fine roots; common very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; few faces of peds are coated with gypsum; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

	By3--25 to 49 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine pores; 3 percent pebbles; many medium threads and filaments of gypsum; weakly cemented; few spherical masses of strongly cemented gypsum; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 30 inches thick)

	By4--49 to 60 inches; pink (7.5YR 8/4) fine sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, few fine roots; few very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; many medium threads and filaments of gypsum; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8)

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, New Mexico; about 14 miles southwest of Carrizozo; 2,000 feet south, 500 feet east of the NW corner of Sec. 1, T. 10 S., R. 8. E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section is usually dry in all parts less than three-fourths of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Ustic aridic moisture regime.  

Soil temperature: 59 to 65 degrees F.

Depth to Gypsic horizon: 12 to 30 inches

Reaction: Moderately to strongly alkaline

Particle-size control section (weighted average):

Clay content: 18 to 27 percent

Coarse fragment content: less than 15 percent gravels

Percent Gypsum: 20 to 30 percent 

A horizon: 
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist 

By horizon: 
Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 8 dry or moist
Chroma: 2 to 6 dry or moist
Stratified sand and gravels are common below 60 inches.
Other features: some pedon contain Bw horizons

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Malargo soils are on alluvial basins in the Tularosa Valley. Slopes are dominantly 1 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,500 feet. Average annual precipitation is about 10 to 12 inches, average annual temperature is about 60 to 64 degrees F. and average frost-free period is about 170 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluepoint and the competing Reflection series. Bluepoint soils are on sand dunes and have a sandy control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Runoff is medium on slopes of 1 to 5 percent; high runoff on 5 to 8 percent slopes.  Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Malargo soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Major species are fourwing saltbush, mesquite, and broom snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Malargo soils are of moderate extent in south central New Mexico. MLRA 42.
