MINNYE SERIES

The Minnye series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from rhyolite, andesite, and related igneous rocks.  Minnye soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmont remnants with slopes ranging from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; in Lodi Valley about 1.7 miles south of Lodi tank and turnoff to the Illinois Mine; about 0.2 miles east of the valley road on a short spur.  Location 2600 feet north and 1400 feet west of the Southeast corner of Sec. 20, T. 13 N., R. 37 E.; USGS Ellsworth, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 58 minutes 35 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 50 minutes 19 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.9765000 latitude, -117.838611 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, but moist for short periods in winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days during the period of July to September due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  11 to 14 degrees C.
Calcium carbonate: Calcareous throughout.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or very strongly alkaline, commonly increases with depth.
Other features: Substratum is commonly stratified.

Particle-size control section - Percent clay: 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 70 percent: 25 to 60 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones.

Chroma: 3 or 4.
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent.

Consistence: Soft to slightly hard dry, very friable to friable, nonsticky to slightly sticky and nonplastic to slightly plastic.

Bk and Bqk horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Texture: Stratified fine sandy loam and loam.
Rock fragments: 45 to 80 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones.
Other features: Lime pendants are common in most pedons and lime is disseminated or forms thin filaments in some pedons.  Accessory silica pendants are in subhorizons in most pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fireball, Jurado, Perazzo, Preatorson, Rednik, Spike, Stonell and Zaba series.  

Fireball, Rednik and Zaba all have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the argillic horizon.  In addition Fireball and Rednik soils are not moist in any part of the moisture control section for 10 days in the summer.  Perazzo soils do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation and contain 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Preatorson soils have noncalcareous argillic horizons and very gravelly sand between 25 and 50 cm. Stonell soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Sutcliff soils are not moist for 10 days in the summer and have 28 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Minnye soils are on alluvial fans.  They formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite, andesite, and other ingneous and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevation is 1,435 to 1,830 meters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is about 10 to 13 degrees C.; the frost-free season is about 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Annaw, Bluewing, Hollywell, Terlco, and Wardenot soils.  Bluewing, Hollywell and Wardenot soils lack argillic horizons.  Annaw and Hollywell soils have cambic horizons. Terlco soils have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is galleta, Bailey greasewood, spiny hopsage, ephedra, cheatgrass, and bud sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West central Nevada.  Minnye soils are of small extent.  MLRA 27
