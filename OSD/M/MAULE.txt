MAULE SERIES

The Maule series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on plateau tops and mountain sideslopes.  They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum from rhyolitic tuff.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Maule stony ashy sandy loam  forestland, on a 17 percent southwest facing slope at 5,300 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted; apparent field textures.)

  A--1 to 5 inches, brown (10YR 4/3) stony ashy sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate fine to medium subangular blocky; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

  AB--5 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) cobbly ashy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine through medium roots, common coarse roots; many very fine to fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

(8 to 10 inches thick.)

  2Bt2--21 to 32 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) cobbly clay, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist, strong medium prismatic structure; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine to coarse roots; few very fine interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; 10 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 12 inches thick.)
