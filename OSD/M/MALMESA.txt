MALMESA SERIES


The Malmesa series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks mainly basalt. Malmesa soils are on mountain slopes, hills, mesas, and plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Argidurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Malmesa very cobbly fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 A--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and coarse vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

(5 to 13 cm thick)

(8 to 30 cm thick) 

 Bqk--28 to 38 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; 10 percent weathered pan fragments and carbonate and silica pendants on bottom of rock fragments; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt broken boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick) 

 Bqkm--38 to 41 cm; cemented duripan; thin (1 mm to 5 cm) indurated laminar cap plugs all fractures. 

 R--41 cm; fractured basalt.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brock, Cleet, Deepeek, Hotcreek, Lapon, Oleman, Shinnpeak, Troughs, Vinini and Wanapum series. 

Brock and Deepeek soils lack bedrock within 100 cm. Cleet soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particles-size control section. Hotcreek and Lapon soils have a duripan at a depth of less than 36 cm. Oleman soils were formed in alluvium dominantly from ignimbrite, rhyolite and limestone. Shinnpeak soils lack summer precipitation. Troughs soils lack bedrock within 50 cm and have a duripan more than 13 cm thick. Vinini and Wanapum soils have bedrock at greater than 50 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Malmesa soils are on hills, mountain slopes, mesas and plateaus. These soils formed in residuum from volcanic rocks; mainly basalt. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,375 to 2,290 meters. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Stewval, and Tokoper series. Stewval soils lack an indurated duripan. Tokoper soils are typic aridic and have a duripan at less than 36 cm. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Malmesa soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, galleta, Indian ricegrass, Nevada ephedra and scattered Joshua trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 29.
