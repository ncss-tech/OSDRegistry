MICAPEAK SERIES

The Micapeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain and foothill slopes. They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 625 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Micapeak soils are on side slopes, ridges and structural benches of mountains and foothills at elevations of 600 to 1,280 meters. They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 500 to 900 mm. The mean annual temperature is 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C. The frost-free period is 80 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kramerhill, Kruse, Quinnamose, and Spokane soils. Kramerhill soils are mesic, deep to a paralithic contact, have fine-loamy argillic horizons and are on convex backslopes of foothills. Kruse soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons, are very deep, and are on linear backslopes of foothills. Quinnamose soils are frigid, are deep to a paralithic contact, and are on mountain and foothill slopes.  Spokane soils are mesic, are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and are on convex backslopes of foothills. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Micapeak soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Potential natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, baldhip rose, pine grass, Saskatoon serviceberry, common snowberry, white spirea, and low Oregon grape. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington, and northern Idaho; MLRA 43A and 44A. Series is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, WA, 2012 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon -- the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Oi, Oe, A horizons) 
Cambic horizon -- the zone from 18 to 84 cm (Bw1, Bw2, BCt horizons) 
Vitrandic feature -- the zone from 3 to 33 cm (A, Bw1 horizons)
Paralithic contact -- the zone beginning at 99 cm (Cr horizon) 
Particle-size control section -- the zone from 28 to 99 cm (part of the Bw1, Bw2, BCt, C horizons) 

This series is correlated to the PSME/PHMA habitat type. 

Significant areas of Micapeak soils were previously mapped as Moscow series in Spokane County.

This series has been reclassified (11/2006) from Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Dystroxerepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on lab data collected in Spokane County, WA. 

Further review is needed to determine differences in volcanic ash influence and mica content in Micapeak soils compared to the similar Labuck series.
