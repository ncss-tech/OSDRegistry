MILLICH SERIES

The Millich series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from andesite. Millich soils are on hills. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature  is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, mesic Lithic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Millich  very stony loam on a west facing (270 degree), 10 percent slope at an elevation of 1618 meters; under mountain big sagebrush  , antelope bitterbrush, needlegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Bt3--30 to 41 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; 47 percent clay; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine roots between peds; few very fine and fine tubular pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 18 cm thick)

    R--41 cm; gray (N 6/) vesicular andesitic bedrock, very hard, but slightly weathered; fractured at intervals of 45 to <100 cm; some clay films in fracture planes.

TYPE LOCATION:  Plumas County, California; WGS84 39.7750000 latitude, 
-120.1855556 longitude; UTM Zone 10, 740933 E 4406587 W, WGS84. About 2 miles south of Vinton; about 500 feet west and 2,000 feet south of the northeast corner of section 9, T. 22 N., R. 16 E., MDB&M. USGS Chilcott 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a mesic temperature regime. 

Soil moisture: The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about mid-July to mid-October(about 90 days). 

Diagnostic Feature(s):
  Mollic epipedon thickness: 18 to 25 cm
	(includes the Bt1 horizon and also the Bt2 horizon in some pedons)
  Argillic horizon thickness: 20 to 42 cm
  Depth to lithic contact: 30 to 50 cm

Particle size control section weighted average:
  Rock fragments: Averages 5 to 15 percent, mainly cobbles. Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as andesite, andesitic tuff, or andesitic tuff-breccia.
  Clay content: Averages 35 to 50 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deven and Devnot series.

Deven soils have an increase in rock fragments with depth. Devnot soils average 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millich soils are on hills. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, andesitic tuff, and tuff-breccia. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. Elevations range from 1,500 to 1,850 meters. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 375 to 640 mm.  The mean annual air temperature  is 7 to 9 degrees C. The frost free period is 95 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aldax and Bieber soils.  Aldax soils lack argillic horizons. Bieber soils have a duripan within 50 cm of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity; very high surface runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: Millich soils are used for livestock grazing. The vegetation is antelope bitterbrush, low sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, singleleaf pinyon, and widely spaced Jeffrey pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern California in MLRA 26 (Carson Basin and Mountains). These soils are not extensive with about 2,000 acres of the series mapped to date.
