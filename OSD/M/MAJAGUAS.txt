COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material--Fine-loamy estuarine deposits
Landscape--Coastal lagoons in Semiarid coastal plain, Puerto Rico
Landform--Lagoon bottoms and edges of mainland coves
Mean Annual Air Temperature--22 to 31 degrees C. (72 to 88 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation--508 to 1,145 millimeters (20 to 63 inches)
Mean Annual Water Temperature--26 to 32 degrees C (79 to 90 degrees F)
Water salinity range--28 to 43 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These include the Colchones, Ostiones, Placeres, and Pozuelo series:
Colchones soils--have thick organic soil horizons and are estuarine tidal stream landform areas
Ostiones soils--allow coarser textured soils and are on slightly higher submerged mainland beaches within the coastal lagoon
Placeres soils--have considerable shell fragments throughout and contain hypersulfidic materials 
Pozuelo soils--have much finer textures with high percentages of clay

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous (permanently submersed)
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses--Areas of this soil are used for commercial and recreational fishing, recreation, wildlife habitat, and coastal carbon storage is an important ecosystem service.
Native Vegetation-- Thalassia (Turtle grass) and Halofila decipiens (Paddle grass)(Lower vegetation density).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Coastal lagoons of Southern coastal plains of Puerto Rico. 
Land Resource Region--Z - Caribbean Region
MLRA--273 - Semiarid Coastal Plains
Extent--Small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SPECIAL PROJECTS OFFICE

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humacao Area, Puerto Rico Eastern Part (PR689); Salinas Municipality, Puerto Rico; 2026. The name is from ponds in Mar Negro area estuary east of Las Mareas community, where it was originally recognized.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is mapped in areas previously published as water in Puerto Rico Soil Survey publications.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon--
Ochric epipedon--the zone 0 to 16 centimeters (0 to 6 inches, Aseg horizon). Peraquic soil moisture regime--Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 2 to 4 meters of salt water).
High n-value--slightly to very fluid throughout
Oxidized pH values--the shell fragments and Halimeda materials that occur throughout this soil buffer the oxidized pH even as sulfidic materials are likely present.

Additional Data:
Typical pedon 2023PR123304
Supporting pedons: 2024PR057415, 2024PR057401
