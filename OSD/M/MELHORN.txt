MELHORN SERIES

The Melhorn series consists of very deep, well drained soils on plateaus and mountains. Melhorn soils are formed in volcanic ash and loess overlying colluvial material derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Melhorn ashy silt loam, woodland, on a 34 percent northwest - facing slope at an elevation of 3,640 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Melhorn soils occur on summits and backslopes of plateaus and mountains. Elevations are 2,500 to 5,500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The soil is formed in volcanic ash and loess overlying colluvial material derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Getaway, Kamela and Klicker soils. Getaway soils are on steep side slopes and are loamy-skeletal. Kamela soils are on steep side slopes, have an ochric epipedon, and more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Klicker soils are moderately deep, have more than 35 percent coarse fragments, and are on steep convex side slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for watershed, wildlife habitat, timber production, livestock grazing and recreation. The native vegetation is grand fir, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, birchleaf spirea, common snowberry, mountain snowberry, common chokecherry, western serviceberry, bitter cherry, ceanothus, Rocky Mountain maple, showy aster, heartleaf arnica, mountain sweet cicely, bracken fern, side-flowered miterwort, dogbane, woods strawberry, mountain brome and pinegrass.
