MILLINGTON SERIES

The Millington series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in calcareous alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Millington silt loam - on a slope of less than 1 percent at an elevation of 198 meters (650 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 41 to 81 cm (16 to 32 inches).] 

 Cg1--124 to 145 cm (49 to 57 inches); black (2.5Y 2.5/1) stratified silt loam and sandy loam; massive; friable; few very fine roots; 2 percent snail shells and 3 percent snail-shell fragments; few fine distinct light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Cg2--145 to 157 cm (57 to 62 inches); dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) sandy loam; massive; friable; 14 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bishop, Havelock, Riverston, Stearns, and Winner series. Bishop soils developed in semiarid areas with less than 640 mm (25 inches) of precipitation and at elevations higher than 457 meters (1500 feet) above mean sea level. Havelock soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 91 cm (36 inches). Riverston soils average less than 18 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Stearns soils have SAR greater than 10 in all parts of the series control section. Winner soils have more than 14 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millington soils are on flood plains. Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. The soils formed in dark colored, stratified calcareous alluvium derived principally from Mollisols that formed in drift and loess of Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 12 degrees C (43 to 54 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 640 to 940 mm (25 to 37 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 165 to 457 meters (540 to 1500 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Du Page, Lawson, and Otter soils. Du Page soils are better drained and are on higher positions. Lawson and Otter soils are noncalcareous and are on similar positions. In addition, they contain less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 46 cm (1.5 feet) below the surface at some time in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) but can range to 42.34 micrometers per second in the substratum. Permeability is moderate but can range to  moderately rapid in the substratum. This soil is subject to rare to common flooding 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for pasture although some areas are cultivated where they are associated with noncalcareous soils and in areas large enough to be economically drained with subsurface drains. Natural vegetation is marsh and wet-prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 95B, 102A, 102B, 103, 108, and 110 in central and northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, western Iowa, and southern Minnesota. The series is of moderate extent.
