MIJAY SERIES

The Mijay series consists of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, predominantly andesite.  Mijay soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

    4C--147 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; few thin silica pendants on undersides of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mijay soils are fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived predominantly from andesite.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,740 to 2,105 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chuckridge, Morbench and Raster soils.  Chuckridge soils are shallow and have an indurated duripan.  Morbench soils lack a duripan and have a calcic horizon.  Raster soils lack a duripan and have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, budsage, shadscale, galleta, Indian ricegrass and Nevada ephedra.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada.  MLRA 29.  These soils are not extensive.
