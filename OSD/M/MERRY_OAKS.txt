MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Chatham County, North Carolina; 2005

REMARKS: Merry Oaks soils were included in the Sylacauga and Wahee series. Sylacauga soils have a lithologic discontinuity and endosaturation. Wahee soils have a fine particle size class. 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon-the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 5 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon-the zone from 10 to 43 inches (Bt and Btg horizons)
Series control section-0 to 60 inches
