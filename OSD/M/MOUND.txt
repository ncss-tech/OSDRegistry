MOUND SERIES

The Mound series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Mound soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Pachic Ultic Argixerolls

(Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizons is 16 to 43 inches.)

    2Cr--44 to 47 inches; partially weathered, brown (7.5YR 4/4) tuff, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry.  (1 to 5 inches thick.)

    2R--47 inches; unweathered brown (7.5YR 4/4) tuff, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) dry.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Oregon; on the Fremont National Forest about 4 miles east-northeast of Lakeview and southeast of Camas Prairie; in the NW1/4, SW1/4, SW1/4, section 8, T. 39 S., R. 21 E.; USGS Lakeview 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually moist from late fall through spring, dry in summer and early fall; The moisture control section is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the winter solstice; Xeric moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 42 to 46 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature - more than 46 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 20 to 35 inches; includes all or the upper part of the argillic horizon.

Depth to bedrock - 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered volcanic rock such as tuff.

Particle-size control - Clay content: 35 to 50 percent;
Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly cobbles.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as basalt or tuff.

Base saturation - 60 to 85 percent in the upper 30 inches and less than 75 percent in the lower part.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Isknat series.  Isknat soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mound soils occur on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  The soil formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt over residuum weathered from tuff and basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 4,700 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 10 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nuss, Polander, Royst, and Winterim soils.  Nuss soils are loamy and are 10 to 20 inches to bedrock.  Polander soils have andic soil properties.  Royst soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Winterim soils have a base saturation of over 75 percent throughout the profile and are at lower elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to high surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mound soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The plant community is a forest consisting of ponderosa pine and white fir.  The percentage of white fir increases on north-facing aspects.  The understory plants consist of common snowberry, Wheeler's bluegrass, heartleaf arnica, starwart, and long-stolon sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 21.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Oregon, Southern Part, 1991.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from 2 to 31 inches (A1, A2, 2Bt1, and 2Bt2 horizons).

Argillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 31 inches (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons).

Paralithic contact - The boundary at 44 inches to underlying weathered bedrock (2Cr layer).


The Ultic subgroup is based on laboratory data from similar soils in the area having the same plant community.  The areas of Mound soil correlated into MLRA E-43 are Vitrandic and need to be recorrelated.
