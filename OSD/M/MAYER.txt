MAYER SERIES

The Mayer series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of a loamy mantle and the underlying sandy and gravelly glacial outwash. These soils are on concave or slightly convex positions on glacial outwash plains, till plains, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Mayer loam, with a slightly convex slope of less than 1 percent, on a glacial outwash plain, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 Ap--0 to 25 centimeters; black (N 2/0) loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine shell fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the A horizon is 36 to 61 centimeters.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The main ones are the Biscay, Cylinder, and Wadena soils which are members of a hydrosequence with Mayer soils.
Biscay--are at similar landscape positions as the Mayer soils and do not have carbonates in all layers between depths of 25 and 50 centimeters
Cylinder--are at slightly higher landscape positions and have a frequently saturated zone at a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of normal years
Wadena--are at higher landscape positions and do not have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 1.8 meters during the wettest periods of normal years

Drainage class--very poorly or poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated at the soil surface during the wettest periods of normal years and this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.00 to 10.00 micrometers per second (moderately high) in the loamy sediments and 10.00 to 705.00 micrometers per second (high or very high) in the underlying materials
Surface runoff potential--negligible to low
Flooding--rarely to frequently flooded for very brief to long duration
Ponding--rarely to frequently ponded for very brief to long duration

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated.  The principal crops are corn and soybeans. The native vegetation is a wet site plant community of tall grass prairie.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Carver County, Minnesota, 1973. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
calcareous family class--carbonates in all parts from a depth of 25 to 50 centimeters;
aquic moisture regime--matrix chroma of 2 or less with redoximorphic features below mollic epipedon.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
