MOUND CREEK SERIES

The Mound Creek series consists of moderately deep, poorly soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy till underlain by Sioux quartzite bedrock. These soils are on nearly level or slightly concave positions on rock-cored terraces or structural benches on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Mound Creek clay loam, on a concave slope of l percent, in a hay field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 25 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A--25 to 56 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam; dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

    Bg--56 to 71 centimeters; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic features; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

    R--71 centimeters; pinkish red, hard quartzite bedrock.
