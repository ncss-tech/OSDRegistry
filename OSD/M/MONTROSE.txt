MONTROSE SERIES

The Montrose series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from calcareous sandstone and shale. Montrose soils are on stream terraces, strath terraces and eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, active, mesic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Montrose silty clay loam in irrigated corn at an elevation of 1,667 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 Ap--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine and medium angular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and medium granular; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 32 cm thick)

 Bt--10 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; 5 percent distinct clay films on faces of peds and on surfaces along pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (12 to 40 cm thick)

 Btz--33 to 91 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silty clay, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 10 percent distinct clay films on all ped faces; 2 percent fine threadlike salt masses in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 60 cm thick)

 C--91 to 165 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) silty clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
