MILLERLAKE SERIES

The Millerlake series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and other sediments derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan aprons, terraces, structural benches, and lower mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Millerlake loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      0--1 to 0 inch; partially decomposed leaves, grass, and other organic materials.

      A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

      BA--4 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium and few coarse roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

      Bt--7 to 20 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and few coarse roots; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds, and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

      Btk--20 to 28 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and coarse roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; strongly effervescent, lime as common soft masses and as filaments and in seams; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

      Bk--28 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent, lime as common soft masses, filaments, and seams; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Carbon County, Wyoming; West quarter corner, sec. 11, T. 18 N., R. 89 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 20 inches or more.  Depth to any contrasting material is greater than 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Millerlake soils are on fan aprons, terraces, structural benches, and lower mountain footslopes and toeslopes.  They formed in slope alluvium and other sediments derived from sedimentary rock.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Elevations are 6,500 to 9,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. and ranges from 34 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bachus, Echemoor, and Decross soils.  The Bachus and Echemoor soils occur on upslope positions on fan aprons and footslopes.  Decross soils occur intermixed with the Millerlake soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid depending upon slope and surface condition.  Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of Idaho fescue, Columbia needlegrass, thickspike wheatgrass, and scattered big sagebrush.  Some areas support relatively thick stands of aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Wyoming, northwestern Colorado and south central Montana.  The series is of moderate extent.  MLRAs 43B, 46, and 48A.
