MILLERLAKE SERIES

The Millerlake series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and other sediments derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan aprons, terraces, structural benches, and lower mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Millerlake loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

      Oe--0 to 3 cm; partially decomposed leaves, grass, and other organic materials.

      A--3 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

      BA--13 to 21 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium and few coarse roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

      Bt--21 to 54 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and few coarse roots; many moderately thick clay films on faces of peds, and lining pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (25 to 76 cm thick)

      Btk--54 to 74 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and coarse roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; strongly effervescent, lime as common soft masses and as filaments and in seams; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 cm thick)

      Bk--74 to 155 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent, lime as common soft masses, filaments, and seams; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
