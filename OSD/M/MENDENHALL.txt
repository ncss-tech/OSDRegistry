MENDENHALL SERIES

Typically, Mendenhall soils have dark gray and gray, very friable, granular, calcareous A horizons about 26 inches thick that are mottled in the lower part over light brownish gray, strongly mottled, sandy loam B2g horizons with low chroma.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous Cumulic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mendenhall loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil              unless otherwise noted.)

    01--3 inches to 0; undecomposed organic material mostly the remains of grasses.

    A11--0 to 10 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium and fine granular and crumb structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 10 percent gravel; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.
(4 to 12 inches)

    A12g--10 to 26 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; common medium prominent mottles of reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to fine granules; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.
(8 to 40 inches thick)

    B2g--26 to 50 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; many large prominent mottles of reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist, and dark gray (2.5Y 4/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Colorado; 1,550 feet west and 1,725 feet south of NE corner Sec. 3, T. 8 N., R. 79 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 50 inches thick.  Conductivity ranges from 0 to 16 millimhos in a major part of the control section and there is no subhorizon more than 4 inches thick a depth of above 20 inches that exceeds 15 percent.  The control section is typically sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam but averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 45 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the control section and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 3.  It ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.

The B2g horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 moist, and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of neutral through 2.  It ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dobrow, Fleer, and Tepee soils.  Dobrow soils are noncalcareous.  Fleer soils have sandy-sketetal material in the lower part of the control section.  Tepee soils have more that 18 percent clay and are noncalcareous.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mendenhall soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping terraces, stream bottoms, and alluvial fans.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 6 percent.  These soils formed in thick calcareous moderately coarse textured alluvial materials derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degree F. and mean summer temperature is 57 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Dobrow and Fleer soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow to very slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing or as native hay meadow.  Native vegetation is timothy, red top, Junegrass, willows, sedges, and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  High mountain valleys of Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent.
