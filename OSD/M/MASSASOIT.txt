MASSASOIT SERIES 

The Massasoit series consists of poorly drained soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits. They are shallow to cemented subsoil and very deep to bedrock. They are on outwash plains or terraces and deltas, in depressions and along drainageways and adjacent to swamps and bogs. Slope ranges from 0 through 5 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the surface horizon, very low or low in the cemented subsoil (ortstein), and high or very high in the substratum.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. (9 degrees C.)and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches (1092 millimeters).

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in the same family. 

The Jebavy, Saugatuck, Pipestone, and Mashpee soils are in related families. Mashpee soils lack a continuous ortstein layer. Jebavy, Saugatuck and Pipestone soils are from outside of region R. Jebavy soils do not have isotic mineralogy and have ortstein layers below a depth of 20 inches (50 centimeters). Saugatuck soils do not have isotic mineralogy and are somewhat poorly drained. Pipestone soils do not have isotic mineralogy, lack continuous ortstein layers, and are somewhat poorly drained. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Massasoit soils are on outwash plains or terraces and deltas, along drainageways and adjacent to swamps and bogs. Slope ranges from 0 through 5 percent. They formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits of late Wisconsin age derived mainly from granite, gneiss and schist. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 through 50 inches (1016 through 1270 millimeters); mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 through 52 degrees F. (7 through 11 degrees C.); frost free period ranges from 100 through 195 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the excessively drained Carver soils, moderately well drained Deerfield soils, poorly drained Mashpee, Mattapoisett and Wareham soils, and very poorly drained Rainberry soils. Rainberry and Mashpee soils lack continuous ortstein layers. Carver and Deerfield soils lack spodic horizons. Mattapoisett soils are on nearby till landscapes and have loamy dense till substrata. Wareham soils lack spodic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Massasoit soils are poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the surface horizon, very low or low in the cemented subsoil, and high or very high in the substratum. An apparent, fluctuating water table is at or near the surface for 7 through 9 months in most years. A perched watertable may also occur above the ortstein layer during periods of heavy precipitation. Some areas are occasionally ponded for brief periods during the months of November through April. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Some areas are used for hay or pasture-land, and some areas are used for cranberry or blueberry production. Common trees include red maple, pitch pine, eastern white pine, gray birch, tupelo, American holly, and white oak. The sapling and shrub layer commonly consists of sweet pepperbush, high bush blueberry, green briar, and swamp azalea. The herbaceous layer typically consists of cinnamon fern, sphagnum moss, teaberry, and starflower. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: New England, New York and New Jersey. MLRA 144A and 149B. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Plymouth County, Massachusetts, 2010. 

REMARKS: Massasoit soils were formerly mapped as Saugatuck. Saugatuck soils are from outside of region R. They do not have isotic mineralogy, receive less annual rainfall than Massasoit soils, and are somewhat poorly drained.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (0 to 33 centimeters)(O, A, and Eg horizons). 
2. Albic horizon - the zone from 5 to 13 inches (13 to 33 centimeters)(Eg1 and Eg2 horizons). 
3. Spodic horizon - the zone from 13 to 26 inches (33 to 66 centimeters)(Bhs, Bsm and Bs horizons). 
4. Ortstein layer - the zone from 17 to 23 inches (43 to 58 centimeters)(Bsm horizons). 
5. Aquic conditions and Aquods suborder - redox features in the albic and spodic horizons within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Two pedons have been analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE, S91MA-023-004 (sampled as Pipestone) and S92NH-011-001 (sampled as Saugatuck).
