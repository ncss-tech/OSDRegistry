GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Medaryville soils are on flats and swells on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Medaryville soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy and sandy water-sorted materials and in the underlying lacustrine materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brady, Gilford, Headlee, Milford, Mermill, Radioville, Rensselear, Whitepost, and Whiskerville soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford, Mermill, Milford, Rensselaer, and Whitepost soils are in depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Brady and Headlee soils are on similar landforms. The moderately well drained Whiskerville soils are on higher swells.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper loamy and sandy materials and moderately low or low in the underlying lacustrine mateials. Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy and sandy materials and slow or very slow in the underlying lacustrine materials. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay are the principal crops. Native vegetation is prairie grasses (tall grass prairie).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pulaski County, Indiana, 2001.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (Ap horizon). 
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 81 cm (11 to 32 inches) (Bt horizon). 
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below a depth of 28 cm (11 inches).

NASIS Data Mapunit ID 155029 represents the typical pedon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S99IN131-005) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, NE. Transect data for the typical pedon (T00IN-131-002) is on file in the MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 80 percent Medaryville soils, 10 percent Strole soils, and 10 percent Milford soils.
