MEDRANO SERIES

The Medrano series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to duripans. Medrano soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from scoria (cinders). They are on cinder cones. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is intermittently moist in some part from July to October and December to March. It is assumed to be dry in all parts 50 to 75 percent of the time (cumulative), when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or higher. The soils are driest in May and June. The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on ustic.

COMPETING SERIES: At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Medrano soils are on backslopes of cinder cones.  They formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from scoria (cinders). Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Calabasas, Churipa, Tetilla, and Tsinat soils. Calabasas soils are deep to petrocalcic horizons, are fine-silty, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus. Churipa soils are shallow to duripans and moderately deep to basalt, are loamy, and occur on beveled summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Tetilla soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches, do not have cemented pans, and occur on toeslopes of undulating plateaus. Tsinat soils are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons, have calcic horizons, and occur on beveled summits of plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid surface runoff; moderately slow permeability in the subsoil, very slow permeability in the duripan horizon, and very rapid permeability in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Medrano soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, galleta, sideoats grama, black grama, New Mexico feathergrass, oneseed juniper, and twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Gravelly(R036XB114NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Medrano soils are of small extent on the southcentral Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.
