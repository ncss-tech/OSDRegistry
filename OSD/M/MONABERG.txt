MONABERG SERIES 

The Monaberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and alpine till derived from hard fine grained igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan remnants, moraines, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Monaberg gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Bt3--27 to 48 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) gravelly clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common medium pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual irregular boundary. (combined thickness of Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons - 15 to 45 inches)

    BC--48 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) gravelly loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan remnants, moraines, hills and mountain slopes 
Elevation - 5,500 to 8,450 feet
Slope - 0 to 35 percent
Parent material - alluvium, colluvium and alpine till derived from hard fine grained igneous and metamorphic rocks 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 40 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adel, Libeg and Nieman soils. Adel soils are pachic and in more concave positions. Libeg soils are loamy-skeletal and on similar landform positions. Nieman soils are shallow and on more convex positions.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Monaberg soils are primarily used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, Richardson needlegrass, lupine, western yarrow, sticky geranium, and shrubby cinquefoil.  Some small areas have a thin canopy cover of quaking aspen and Douglas-fir. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Monaberg soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA - 43B.
