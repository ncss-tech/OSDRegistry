MARYJANE SERIES

The Maryjane series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Maryjane soils are on inset fans and lower back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Pachic Calciustolls

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Kitgram (NV) series. Kitgram soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maryjane soils are on inset fans and lower back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 8 to 75 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and/or colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Elevations are 6,500 to 9,100 feet. The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and common summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches; mean annual air temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 50 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are  Kitgram, Mountmummy, Robbersfire and Thesisters soils. Mountmummy and Kitgram soils are moderately deep to bedrock on upper back slopes of mountains. Robbersfire soils do not have a mollic epipedon. on north facing back slopes of mountains Thesisters soils are very shallow or shallow to bedrock on upper back slopes of mountains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for forest and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine with some curlleaf mountainmahogany and currant. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30. These soils are of moderate extent.
