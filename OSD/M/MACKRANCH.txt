MACKRANCH SERIES

The Mackranch series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Mackranch soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry in the moisture control section; moist in winter and spring; dry in summer and fall unless irrigated; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mackranch soils are on flood plains.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks but with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,450 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Henningsen, Job, Kazul, Morwen, and Whitmire soils.  Henningsen and Morwen soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have aquic conditions at depths of 76 to 100 cm from the soil surface.  Job soils are fine-loamy, have ochric epipedons, and endosaturation at depths between 90 and 150 cm from the soil surface.  Kazul soils are fine-loamy, have cambic horizons, and endosaturation at depths between 122 and 150 cm from the soil surface.  Whitmire soils have thick mollic epipedons and have strongly contrasting sandy material at depths between 50 and 76 cm from the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 76 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  The water table drops below 100 cm in the fall.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mackranch soils are used for irrigated pasture, hayland, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly willows, cottonwood, sedges, rushes, and grasses.  The vegetation in cultivated areas is mainly legume-grass hay or improved pasture.  These soils are also a source for gravel (aggregate) for concrete manufacture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A1, A2, and A3 horizons).
Major lithologic discontinuity - The clear change to sandy-skeletal material with the boundary at 36 cm (between the A3 and 2Cg1 horizons).
Aquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 50 and 152 cm at certain times in normal years (parts of the 2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons).
Particle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (A3 and 2Cg1 horizons and parts of the A2 and 2Cg2 horizons).
