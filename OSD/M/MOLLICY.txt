MOLLICY SERIES

The Mollicy series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments.
They are on Pleistocene age stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0
to 5 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Aquic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mollicy loam on a low convex ridge about 2 percent slope in a cultivated field.
                (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

     Ap--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam; few fine faint
grayish brown and yellowish brown mottles; platy parting to weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine, medium and coarse roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

     B21t--5 to 14 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam; common fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and few medium prominent
red (2.5YR 4/6) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky
structure; friable; few fine to coarse roots; common very fine
pores; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; few soft black masses; extremely acid; clear irregular boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

     B22t--14 to 26 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam; common medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) and common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; moderate medium subangular
blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; common fine pores; thin continuous clay films on faces of peds; few coarse
black masses; extremely acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20
inches thick)

     B23t--26 to 34 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam; many medium prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) and many medium distinct
gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; moderate angular blocky structure; firm; common fine pores; thin discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; common medium black concretions; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

     IIB24t--34 to 46 inches; mottled yellowish brown (10YR 5/6)
and red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam; common medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine pores; thick almost continuous clay films;
extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 18 inches thick)

     IIB31t--46 to 62 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam; common coarse distinct gray (10YR 5/1) and common medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; thin discontinuous clay films on faces of peds; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches
thick)

     IIB32--62 to 76 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; common medium and coarse distinct gray (10YR 5/1) mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots in
gray material; extremely acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 inches thick)

     IIB33--76 to 90 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; common medium and coarse light gray (10YR 7/1) streaks and pockets
of sand make up 30 percent of the horizon; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Morehouse Parish, Louisiana 8 miles NW of Bastrop;
55 feet north of field road; 550 feet east of SW corner in the SW1/4SW1/4, sec. 23, T. 22 N., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is greater than 55
inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid,
except where the soil has been limed.  The effective Cation
Exchange Capacity is 50 percent or more saturated with
exchangeable aluminum in the control section to a depth of 30
inches or more.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to
4.  Where color value is 3, thickness is 6 inches or less.  The A horizon is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.

The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and dominant chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have subhorizons of the
B2t horizon with chroma of 2.  The texture is silty clay loam,
silt loam, or clay loam.  Mottles in shades of gray, yellow,
brown, and red and are few to many.

The IIB horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 2.5YR, value of 4 to
6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, or fine
sandy loam, and is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, and red.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Columbus, Eunola, and Whitman
series in the same family and the Rosenwall and Sacul series in similar families.  Columbus, Eunola, and Whitman series lack IIB horizons.  Rosenwall and Sacul have clayey control sections and
mixed mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mollicy soils are on low slightly convex
ridges on late Pleistocene age stream terraces.  Slopes range from
0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvial sediments.  Mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches and mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F. near the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Groom, Guyton, Haggerty, Litro, Perry, Portland, and Wrightsville soils.  The
poorly drained Groom and Wrightsville soils are in swales and on broad flats.  Litro, Perry, and Portland soils have clayey
textures and are at lower elevations.  Guyton soils are poorly drained.  Haggerty soils have coarse-loamy control sections and
are at slightly lower elevations.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Slow to
medium runoff.  Moderately slow permeability.  These soils are flooded to shallow depths in winter and spring when streams
overflow.  An apparent water table is at depths of 1.5 to 3.0 feet below the surface December through June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in woodland.  Native
vegetation is loblolly pine, sweetgum, willow oak, and persimmon.
In drained areas these soils are planted to small grains and soybeans.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Gulf Coastal Plain, north central Louisiana.  The series is inextensive.
