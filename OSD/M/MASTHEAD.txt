MASTHEAD SERIES

The Masthead series consists of moderately well drained soils that formed in schist and meta-sedimentary rock from slope alluvium and residuum. Masthead soils are on side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees Celsius (69 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Mollic Palexeralfs

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bapos  (CA), Benridge  (CA), Hellman  (CA), Honker (CA), Kimball (CA), Milpitas (CA), Newville (CA), Positas (CA), Tierra (CA) and Wappo series. Bapos soils are greater than 60 inches deep and are on fans and terraces. Benridge soils are greater that 60 inches deep and have mineralogy dominated by amorphous material. Hellman soils are greater than 60 inches deep and become more acid with depth. Honker soils are on sandstone and frost free days less than 260. Kimball soils are very deep or have duripans below 40 inches. Milpitas soils are very deep and are on terraces from alluvium. Newville soils are very deep. Positas soils are deep and have less then 280 frost free days. Tierra soils are deep and are on terraces from alluvium. Wappo soils are very deep in aluuvium and have less than 205 frost free days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Masthead soils formed in schist (Catalina schist) and associated meta sedimentary materials (Franciscan formation) side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains on islands. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are from sea level to 1550 feet (0 to 472 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with potential fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches (330 to 660 mm), the mean annual temperature is 61 to 73 degrees F. (16 to 23 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 365 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coastwise, and Dewpoint. Coastwise soils are shallow. Dewpoint soils are mesic and found under dense shrubs and oaks. These soils are found on hills and mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: moderately well drained; moderately high runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat, recreation and building site development. Vegetation is low shrubs and annual grasses, California sage, ferguss grass, Lemonade berry, Lural sumac, scrub oaks and Toyon.
