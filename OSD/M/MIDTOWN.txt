MIDTOWN SERIES

The Midtown series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 150 cm of loamy human transported materials over loamy till. These soils are deep or very deep to dense till. They occur on anthropogenic landforms on water-lain moraines and wave-worked till plains in and near major urbanized areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, spolic, mixed, semiactive, calcareous, mesic Anthroportic Udorthents

COMPETING SERIES: No other series are described in this family. 

The Riverfront series is in a similar family. Riverfront soils do not have densic material or redoximorphic depletions within 200 cm of the mineral soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Midtown soils are on nearly level to steeply sloping anthropogenic landforms on wave-worked till plains and water-lain moraines. These soils formed in a mantle of human transported material 50 to 150 cm thick over loamy till of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 720 to 960 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. Frost free period is 135 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fortress family and Riverfront soils. Both are found on human-altered landforms. Fortress soils have a sandy particle size control section. Riverfront soils do not have aquic conditions and are found on higher areas of the landscape with respect to Midtown. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high in the solum and C horizon and very low in the Cd horizon. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are typically covered by turfgrass and common weeds and used for recreation, urban, and industrial development. Some areas are wooded. Common trees include silver maple, tree of heaven, Chinese elm, and boxelder.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils occur on modified landscapes in and near major urbanized areas in MLRA 99. They are of small extent with about 1,650 acres of the series mapped, but they are an important component of open space in urban areas. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Amherst, Massachusetts 

SERIES PROPOSED: Wayne County, Michigan, 2016. The name is after a business area in downtown Detroit, Michigan.

REMARKS: This series actually classifies as a Fine-loamy, spolic, mixed, semiactive, calcareous, mesic Anthroportic Udorthents. Soil business systems are in the process of being updated to accommodate human-transported material classes. The spolic family term will be added to the Taxonomic Class section once the system updates are complete. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from a depth of 0 to 15 cm (^Au horizon). 
Human transported material - the zone from a depth of 0 to 56 cm (^Au and ^Cu horizons). 
Aquic conditions - iron depletions or matrix color with value of 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 between the depths of 56 to 150 cm. (BCgb, C, and Cd horizons).
Densic material - the zone from 150 to 203 cm (Cd horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data from pedon S2012MI163016, samples 13NO2569-13NO2573 from Wayne County, MI, is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/.
