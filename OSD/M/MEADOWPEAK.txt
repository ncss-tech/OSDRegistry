MEADOWPEAK SERIES 

The Meadowpeak series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and closed depressions.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Aeric Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Meadowpeak silt loam, forested (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 4 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine, very fine, medium, and coarse roots; slightly acid (ph 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    AC--4 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; slightly acid (ph 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    C1--9 to 16 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; slightly acid (ph 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    C2--16 to 25 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) silt loam, light gray (5Y 7/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; neutral (ph 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick) 

    C3--25 to 34 inches; olive gray (5Y 5/2) and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam consisting of thin layers of silt loam and loam, light gray (5Y 7/2) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; neutral (ph 7.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

    C4--34 to 60 inches; white (5Y 8/1) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; few fine distinct olive yellow (5Y 6/6) redox concentrations; neutral (ph 6.8).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Meadowpeak soils are used for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mainly Engelmann spruce, water birch, alder, black hawthorn, and black cottonwood.  Understory vegetation is mainly sedges, rushes, willow, and other perennial grasses and forbs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Meadowpeak soils are of limited extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.  MLRA 43A and 44A.
