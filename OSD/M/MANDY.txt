TYPE LOCATION:
County: Pendleton County
State: West Virginia
USGS Quadrangle: Spruce Knob, West Virginia
Latitude (Decimal Degrees, NAD 83): 38.712711 north
Longitude (Decimal Degrees, NAD 83): 79.566875 west
Directions to the pedon: Approximately 1.23 miles northeast of Spruce Knob Lake and 190 feet  east-southeast of the intersection of U.S. Forest Service Trail number 532 and U. S. Forest Service Road number 112.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the top of the Cambic horizon:  5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 inches)
Depth to the base of the Cambic horizon:  51 to 91 cm (20 to 36 inches)
Solum Thickness:  51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Depth to Bedrock: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Depth Class:  Moderately deep
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table:  Greater than 183 cm (72 inches)
Rock Fragment content: 10 to 25 percent, by volume, in the A, E, or transitional horizons; 20 to 70 percent in the Bhs, Bs, and Bw horizons; 50 to 90 percent in the BC and C horizons. 
Soil Reaction: Ultra acid to very strongly acid in the mineral soil, unless limed. Organic surface horizons may be strongly acid. 
Other Soil Features: The Bhs and/or Bs horizons have spodic properties.  However, the spodic properties are not strongly expressed and the horizons do not meet the requirements of a spodic horizon. 
In many pedons, the horizons in the upper part of the solum have been mixed by trees throws, soil creep, or a combination of these processes. The upper solum commonly contains mixed or combined horizons and horizons with broken or irregular boundaries. 

Range of Individual Horizons:

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Pendleton County, West Virginia, 1988.

REMARKS:  
This soil was previously mapped as a moist phase of the Berks series, and to a lesser extent a moist phase of the Dekalb series.
 
Mandy soils were previously classified as Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid, Typic Dystrudepts.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches) (Oi and A horizons).
Spodic properties--the zone from 10 to 25 centimeters (4 to 10 inches) (Bs horizon).
Cambic horizon--the zone from 10 to 61 centimeters (4 to 24 inches) (Bs and Bw horizons).
Skeletal feature--Approximately 39 percent (by volume) weighted average rock fragments in the 25 to 69 centimeters (10 to 24 inches) control section.
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 69 centimeters (0 to 27 inches).

This edit updates the classification of the series, recognizes spodic properties, updates the horizon nomenclature and reaction classes of the typical pedon, the range in characteristics, the competing and geographically associated soils, the geographic setting, and the distribution.
