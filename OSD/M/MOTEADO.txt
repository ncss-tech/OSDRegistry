MOTEADO SERIES

The Moteado series consists of deep, poorly drained soils on narrow concave ridgetops and side slopes of uplands.  They formed in residuum and colluvium that weathered from andesitic to basaltic, marine deposited volcanic and volcanoclastic sandstone and mudstone of the Hato Puerco, Fajardo, and Tabonuco formations.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 200 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.

TYPE LOCATION:  Rio Grande Municipio; Noreste SWCD, Puerto Rico; Caribbean National Forest.  Approximately 3,000 feet east-southeast of the termination of Road 911 on West Fork Trail past the creeks and after the Trail turns south and levels out on the contour, then downslope.  El Yunque topographic quadrangle; lat. 18 degrees 18 minutes 46 seconds N.; long. 66 degrees 48 minutes 54 seconds W.; PRD 1940.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to volcanic sandstone bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent, by volume, throughout the profile.  Cobbles and stones cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface area.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the profile.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and gray range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, their cobbly or stony analogs.

The Bog horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and gray range from few to many.  Texture is clay loam, clay, their gravelly or very gravelly analogs.

The Bo horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray range from few to many.  Texture is clay loam, clay, their gravelly or very gravelly analogs.

The B'og horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bog horizon.

The R layer is composed of unweathered hard volcanic sandstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moteado soils are on concave summits and side slopes of mountains in uplands that receive constant precipitation.  The elevation is more than 2,000 feet.  The climate is humid tropical.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 170 to 230 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Dwarf, Guayabota, Los Guineos, Palm, and Yunque soils.  Dwarf soils are on higher positions, are isomesic, very deep, and have a histic epipedon.  Guayabota soils are shallow to bedrock.  The well drained Los Guineos soils are very deep and have less clay in the subsoil.  Palm soils are very deep and have clayey-skeletal control sections.  The moderately well drained Yunque soils are very deep and have less clay in the subsoil.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Watershed protection, research, recreation, and wildlife habitat.  Forested with over 200 native and introduced woody species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Caribbean National Forest, Puerto Rico.  The series is of minor extent.
