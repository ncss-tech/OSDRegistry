MENDEL SERIES

The Mendel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium or alluvium over till derived from granitic rocks. The Mendel soils are on flood plain steps of glacial-valley bottoms and cirque floors of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 920 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mendel soils are on flood plain steps of glacial-valley bottoms and cirque floors. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium or alluvium over till, derived from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 2505 to 3885 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 560 to 1435 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 0 to 4 degrees C. The frost free season is 50 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ladderlake and Littlepete soils. Ladderlake soils are poorly or very poorly drained soils on flood-plain steps, with a histic epipedon and aquic conditions within 25 cm of the soil surface. Littlepete soils are poorly drained soils on floodplains with aquic conditions within 50 cm of the soil surface, and average less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity, occasional to frequent flooding for very brief to brief (4 hrs to 7 days) duration from May to July, none to rare ponding for brief (2 to 7 days) duration from May to July. Seasonal high water table at 50 to 100 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is shorthair reedgrass, dwarf bilberry, tundra aster, bluejoint, Idaho bentgrass, timber oatgrass, purple mountainheath, sedges, Sierra willow, and scattered Sierra lodgepole pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
