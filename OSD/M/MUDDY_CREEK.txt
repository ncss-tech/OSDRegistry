GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape:  Northern Coastal Plain estuaries
Landform:  Submerged tidal marshes and estuarine tidal stream channels
Parent Material:  Fine-silty estuarine deposits over herbaceous organic material
Slope:  0 to 3 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature:  50 to 59 degrees F. (10 to 15 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Water Depth Range:  0 to 5 feet (0 to 1.5 meters)
Water Regime:  Tidal, 0 to 1 foot (0 to 0.3 meters) tidal range
Water Salinity Range:  7 to 15 ppt

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Fox Creek soils - have organic soil materials greater than 40 centimeters thick near the soil surface and occur on submerged tidal marsh landforms. 
Contees Wharf soils - occur on similar landforms but do not have buried organic horizons between 100 and 200 centimeters. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous drainage
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Moderately low to high
Soil Moisture Regime:  Peraquic
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water.  The presence of hypo-sulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air. 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses:  Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture. 
Dominant Vegetation:  Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain sub-estuaries of the western portion of Chesapeake Bay.  MLRA 149A.  This series is of small extent. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2018. 

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is named for Muddy Creek, which is a tributary to the Rhode River sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay.  Areas of mapping were formerly included with water. 

Diagnostic Horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric Epipedon-the zone from 0 to 22 centimeters (Ase horizon)
Peraquic feature-the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters which is permanently saturated
Sapric soil materials-the zone from 116 to 195 centimeters (2Oaseb1 and 2Oaseb2 horizons)
Hypo-sulfidic materials-the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters
Hyper-sulfidic materials-the zone from 71 to 200 centimeters, oxidized pH values less than 4.0 after 16 weeks.
Lithologic discontinuity-the zones from 116 to 195 (2Oaseb horizons) and 195 to 200 centimeters (3Cseg horizon)
