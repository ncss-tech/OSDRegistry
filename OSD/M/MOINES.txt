MOINES SERIES

The Moines series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in calcareous, loamy till. These soils are slightly convex low knolls on dissected ground moraines.

gypsic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 76 centimeters (Bygl and Byg2 horizons);
calcic horizon--the zone from a depth of 76 to 102 centimeters (Bk horizon);
aquic moisture regime.

This series was previously identified in Cottonwood County, Minnesota as Jeffers Variant. 1/21/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
