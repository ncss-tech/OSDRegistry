MORENDA SERIES

The Morenda series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Morenda soils are on treads of low stream terraces and inset fans of valley floors. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Plite, Posada (T), Soward, Sowcan, and Telecan series.
Plite and Telecan soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering aridic; in addition Plite soils have fewer than 5 percent rock fragments in the control section.
Posada soils do not have aquic conditions and have secondary carbonates.
Soward soils do not have aquic conditions and have a cambic horizon.\
Sowcan soils have less than 15 percent mica in the control section and receive most of their moisture in the spring.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Morenda soils are on treads of low stream terraces and inset fans of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 40 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Enmedio, Espanola, and Fiesta soils. Enmedio soils are loamy-skeletal over fragmental and occur on backslopes of hills. Espanola soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on risers of high stream terraces. Fiesta soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on footslopes of valley sides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; low surface runoff; permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Morenda soils are used for timber production, urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is Arizona fescue, Gambel's oak, elk grass, muttongrass, ponderosa pine.  The ecological site is Pinus ponderosa-Juniperus scopulorum/Quercus gambleii-Cercocarpus montaus/Poa fendleriana-Muhlenbergia montana(F070XA022NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Morenda soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 48A.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008. Morenda is coined from a local Spanish name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 35 inches. (A, AB, Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)
Cumulic feature - An irregular decrease in organic carbon is inferred from the variable textures in the zone from 10 to 35 inches.
Lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to sandy-skeletal material at 46 inches. (upper boundary of the 2Cg1 horizon)
Endosaturation - - Observed saturation at 58 inches and also inferred from the low chroma in the 2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons.
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and part of the BC horizon)
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
