MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Atlantic Coastal Plain and Fall Line Region in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina 
Extent: large 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spotsylvania County, Virginia, 1980. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone between 0 and 9 inches (Oi and Ap horizons). 
Argillic horizon - the zone between 9 and 45 inches (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within 40 inches of the soil surface, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
The soil horizon depths were modified on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.
