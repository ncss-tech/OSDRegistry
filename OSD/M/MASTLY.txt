MASTLY SERIES

The Mastly series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Mastly soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains over lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Duric Xeric Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mastly very fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong thin and medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine and common fine and medium roots; many fine and medium and few coarse vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 cm thick)

    A2--15 to 38 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam with thin strata of fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    2Bkq--38 to 69 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, brittle, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weak continuous silica cementation; few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few fine carbonate filaments and threads; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    3C1--69 to 99 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine and medium interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    4C2--99 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam with thin strata of fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; about 750 feet south and 2,600 feet west of the northeast corner of section 5 T. 31 N., R. 20E.; latitude 40 degrees 35 minutes 45 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 45 minutes 39 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring months; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.  This soil receives additional moisture from run on.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to Bkq horizon: 25 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Other features: Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  Less than 5 percent.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Carbonates:  Slightly effervescent through strongly effervescent.

Bkq horizon
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist.
Texture:  Sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.
Clay content:  10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  Less than 5 percent.
Carbonates:  Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent; segregated secondary carbonates occur as filaments, threads or soft masses.
Cementation:  Weak continuous silica cementation.

C horizons
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Stratified sand through very fine sandy loam.  Averages fine sandy loam.
Clay content:  10 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  Less than 5 percent.
Sructure:  Massive or platy due to layering of strata.
Carbonates:  Slightly effervescent through strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mastly soils are on stream terraces and small flood plains in lake terraces.  These soils formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,170 to 1,210 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with warm, dry summers and cool, dry winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 110 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mazuma soils.  Mazuma soils lack an irregular decrease in organic matter.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, Wyoming big sagebrush, basin big sagebrush, shadscale, rabbitbrush, basin wildrye and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24.
