TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic, thermic Terric Haplosaprists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mattan muck - wooded.  (Colors are for moist soil.  When described, the soil was saturated to the surface.)

Oa1--0 to 14 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) muck (sapric material); about 15 percent fiber rubbed; massive; many fine and medium roots; flows easily between fingers when squeezed; weak sulfide odor; extremely acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

Oa2--14 to 40 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) muck (sapric material); about 10 percent fiber rubbed; massive; flows easily between fingers when squeezed; slight sulfide odor; common large pieces of fibrous woody materials; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (14 to 40 inches thick)

2Cg1--40 to 48 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand; massive; slightly sticky, nonplastic; flows easily between fingers when squeezed; common fine roots and fibers; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

2Cg2--48 to 60 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) sandy clay loam; massive; sticky, slightly plastic; flows easily between fingers when squeezed; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  New Kent County, Virginia; approximately 1/2 mile north of junction of VA-608 and VA-609 and 3/4 mile south of Pamunkey River; 50 feet east of private road to Big Island.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 72 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: +6 to 6 inches, January to December
Soil Reaction: extremely acid through moderately acid in the natural state;  upon drying, the reaction usually drops slightly 
Other Features: 
sulfur content ranges from none to about 0.5 percent in the organic layers 
n-value of the organic materials ranges from 2 to 5.5
organic materials are from a mixture of herbaceous and woody plants
Large pieces of logs and limbs that can be penetrated with an auger are in most pedons
Mineral strata less than 12 inches thick are in some pedons within the control section

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

Surface tier:
Color-- neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5G, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 3
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- commonly sapric material but ranges to hemic in some pedons; some pedons have surface with mucky analogue of sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam 

Subsurface tier:
Color-- neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5GY, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 4
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- dominantly sapric material but thin layers of hemic material are in some pedons 

Cg horizon::
Color-- neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- commonly stratified and ranges from loamy sand through silty clay loam or the mucky analogues of those textures. The upper 12 inches has a weighted average clay content of 12 to 35 percent 

COMPETING SERIES:
Delway soilsmostly herbaceous plant materials
Shinkee soils-- have rapid permeability in the organic materials; in addition, the mean annual precipitation is less than 16 inches 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
  Landscape: Coastal Plain
  Landform: marshes and low lying areas along rivers and creeks
  Parent Material: herbaceous and woody plant remains and fluvial sediments 
  Elevation: 0 to 5 feet
  Mean Annual Air Temperature: 58 to 62 degrees
  Mean Annual Precipitation: 40 to 50 inches
  Frost Free Period: 185 to 225 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Axis soilsmineral soil, similar landform
Bohicket soils-- mineral soil, similar landform 
Johnston soils-- mineral soil, adjacent flood plains 
Lanexa soils-- underlain by clayey sediments and formed in mostly herbaceous organic materials 
Levy soils-- mineral soil, similar landform 
Nawney soils-- mineral soil, adjacent flood plains 
Roanoke soils-- mineral soil, adjacent stream terraces

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
  Drainage class (Agricultural): very poorly drained
  Index Surface Runoff: negligible
  Internal Free Water Occurrence: very shallow, permanent
  Permeability: moderate
  Other: The water table is controlled by flooding and ponding and ranges from 6 inches below the surface during extremely dry months to 24 inches above the surface most of the time.  Wind tides and storm tides cause inundation up to 36 inches

USE AND VEGETATION:
  Major Uses: wetland wildlife habitat 
  Dominant Vegetation: overstory trees include water-tolerant species such as water tupelo, ash, red maple, bald cypress, and sweetgum.  Understory species include Arrow-arum, arrowhead, American waterlily, southern bayberry, alder, and greenbrier

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
  Distribution: Coastal Plain of Virginia and possibly North Carolina and Maryland 
  Extent: moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  New Kent County, Virginia, 1985. 

REMARKS: These soil areas have been included with higher order units, swamps, and mixed alluvial lands in past mapping 

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Organic soil materials - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 40 inches.
Loamy family feature - the weighted average particle size of that part of the mineral soil within the control section (the zone from 40 to 51 inches).
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 40 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data for the site location (S81VA-127-008) and another pedon (S81VA-127-010) are available from the NSSL, Lincoln, NE
