MOWBRAY SERIES

The Mowbray series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TYPICAL PEDON:  Mowbray very channery loam, coniferous forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--2 inches to 0; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

(8 to 46 inches thick)

    BC--22 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) very flaggy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak very thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; many fine interstitial pores; 25 percent flagstones, 10 percent cobbles, 20 percent channers; 20 percent channer size soft fragments; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carter County, Montana, 1992.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT1140.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A and B horizons); a cambic horizon from 2 to 11 inches (Bw horizon); an accumulation of secondary calcium carbonates from 11 to 22 inches (Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk and BC horizons).  Mowbray soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
