R horizon: weakly to very strongly cemented or indurated coral limestone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Semiarid coastal plain in southern Puerto Rico (MLRA 273).
Landform: Coastal beaches protected by barrier reef
Parent Material: calcareous sandy and loamy mixed marine deposits
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 22 to 31 degrees C. (71 to 88 degrees F.)
Mean Annual Precipitation: 508 to 1,600 millimeters (20 to 63 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
El Indio series is similar in the control section composition but sandier and bedrock occurs at deeper (greater than 100 centimeters) depths.
Manglillo soils have thick organic horizons, are very deep (greater than 150 centimeters) to bedrock, and occur in similar landform positions. 
Mar Negro soils have thick organic horizons, are very deep (greater than 150 centimeters) to bedrock, have subaqueous drainage and occur on similar but lower landscape positions.
San Felipe soils have thick organic horizons, are very deep (greater than 150 centimeters) to bedrock, and occur on similar landscape positions 
Jaucas soils are much deeper to water tables, occur considerably higher on the landscape and are very deep (greater than 150 centimeters) to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Very high
Flooding frequency and duration: Very frequent for extremely brief duration from tides, subject to flooding by storm surge and hurricanes

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Wildlife habitat
Dominant Vegetation: Black and white mangrove, batis, majaguilla and other halophitic herbaceous plants.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern coastal plains of Puerto Rico. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Guayama Municipality, Puerto Rico; 2021. The name is from the Caribbean Sea which is directly to the south of where these soils form on the beach, where it was originally recognized.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
1. Ochric epipedon--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches; A and AC horizons).
2. Lithic (moderately deep) contact-81 centimeters (32 inches; R horizon).
3. Peraquic features-Endosaturation ranges from 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches).
4. Sulfidic feature-the zone from 0 to 81 centimeters (32 inches) contains sulfidic soil materials.

These soils were formerly included in the coastal beach, Meros sand or miscellaneous land type mapunits.
