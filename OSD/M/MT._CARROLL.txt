Batavia, Deroin, Downs, Harvard, Knox, Luana, Watkins, Waubeek and Yutan soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Bowes soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Churchtown, Myrtle, and Newhouse soils have more than 15 percent sand in the upper part of the series control section. Ella and Festina soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and average more than 15 percent sand. Frankville, Massbach, Nasset, Oak Center soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths less than 152 cm (60 inches). Gladek soils formed in lacustrine sediments. Greenbush and Mannon soils have zones within 152 cm (60 inches) that are frequently saturated for periods longer than one month. Hersey soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and average more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. Mellott soils have less than 50 percent silt in a horizon in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mt. Carroll soils are on ridgetops and side slopes on loess hills and stream benches. They formed in thick loess deposits. Slope gradients typically are 2 to 15 percent, but range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature varies from 7.2 to 12.2 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 760 to 914 mm (30 to 36 inches). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Downs, Fayette, Port Byron, Seaton soils, and Tama soils. Downs soils are on similar landforms nearby. Port Byron and Tama soils are on similar slopes, but are on broad interstream divides further from the drainageways. Tama soils have a mollic epipedon and contain more clay in the finest part of the Bt horizon. Seaton and Fayette soils are on similar or more sloping areas closer to the drainageways. Fayette soils are Typic Hapludalfs and contain more clay in the finest part of the Bt horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Mt. Carroll soils with slopes less than 20 percent are cropped. Corn, soybeans, small grain and meadow are the principal crops. Most steeper areas are in meadow for hay or pasture. Native vegetation is prairie grasses and scattered hardwood 
trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRRs L and M, MLRAs 95B, 104, 105, 108b, and 115C in western Illinois, eastern Iowa, southeastern Minnesota, and southwestern and west-central Wisconsin. Extent is small to moderate.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Henderson County, Illinois, 1947. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 43 cm (17 inches);
Argillic horizon - the zone from about 43 to 103 cm (17 to 55 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

The 122 to 183 cm (4 to 6 feet) water table phase of Mt. Carroll has been correlated to the recently established Mannon series.
