MUDGETTS SERIES

The Mudgetts series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone sources over a petrocalcic horizon. Mudgetts soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Petrocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Mudgetts very fine sandy loam--on a stream terrace sloping 1 to 2 percent to the south east at 4,513 feet elevation-National Parkland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on April 6th, 2011, the soil was dry from 0 to 19 inches and slightly moist throughout the rest of the profile to bedrock.) 

   A1--0 to 3 cm, (0 to 1.2 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few very fine irregularly shaped pores and few fine tubular pores; non effervescent (about1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); five percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

   A2--3 to 15 cm, (1.2 to 5.9 in); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few medium and common fine tubular pores; non effervescent (about1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); three percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick) 

   Bw1--15 to 48 cm, (5.9 to 18.9 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine wedge-shaped aggregates; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; few fine and medium tubular pores; many discontinuous, distinct pressure faces on vertical faces of peds; 3 reversible trans-horizon cracks per meter; non effervescent (about1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); three percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); diffuse smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick) 

   Bw2--48 to 108 cm, (18.9 to 42.2 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine wedge-shaped aggregates; extremely hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; very few fine and common very fine roots; few fine and medium irregularly shaped pores along vertical ped faces; very many discontinuous, distinct pressure faces on vertical faces of peds; 3 reversible trans-horizon cracks per meter; non effervescent (about1 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); seven percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (20 to 30 inches thick) 

   Bkkm--108 to 200 cm, (42.5 to 78.7 in); very strongly cemented petrocalcic horizon consisting of cemented calcium carbonate with embedded rock fragments

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: MUDGETTS soils are on treads of stream terraces and alluvial fans. They formed in alluvium derived from Permian aged limestone and sandstone. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F. The frost-free period is 172 to 186 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lechuguilla, Choza, and Pinery soils. Lechuguilla soils are Shallow to limestone bedrock and occur on upland slopes of mountains and hills. Choza soils are shallow to petrocalcic horizons and have a loamy-skeletal particle size family class. Pinery soils are very deep, have a mollic epipedon and a carbonatic mineralogy class as well as a loamy skeletal particle size class. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to negligible surface runoff; saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from 0.1 to 10 m/sec through the solum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mudgetts soils are used for rangeland, National Park recreation, and wildlife habitat. The current vegetation consists of grasses such as sideoats grama, cane bluestem, blue grama, plains lovegrass, and sand dropseed; shrubs such as vine mesquite, catclaw mimosa, and redberry juniper; and forbs such as desert verbena, and scarlet globemallow. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mudgetts soils are of small extent in the Guadalupe Mountains section of the Basin and Range province in south eastern New Mexico. The MLRA is 70D.
