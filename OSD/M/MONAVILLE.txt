MONAVILLE SERIES

The Monaville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Willis Formation of late Pliocene age. These very gently sloping occur on convex low hills on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean mean annual precipitation is about 1219 mm (48 in) and mean annual temperature is about 23.3 degrees C (74 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Waller County, Texas, 1981. The name is for a small community in Waller County.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 71 to 122 cm (28 to 48 in) (Bt, Btv1, and Btv2 horizon)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon: 71 to 188 cm (28 to 74 in) (Bt and Btv horizons)
Arenic feature: Sandy surface layer from the surface to 71 cm (28 in)
Plinthic feature: 8 to 10 percent plinthite from 86 to 188 cm (34 to 74 in) (Btv horizons)

Additional Comments: These soils were formerly included in the Hockley series.  The series was revised in January 2001 as part of the MLRA 150A update.  Classification was changed from an active to semiactive CEC/Clay class.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from soils with similar parent material taken from Austin, Waller, and Harris Counties.
