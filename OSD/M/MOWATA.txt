MOWATA SERIES

The Mowata series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey fluviomarine deposits of late Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils occur on broad flats along drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).

Vidrine soils: are on circular convex mounds; have chroma of 3 or more in the upper subsoil.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible.  Very slow permeability.  A water table is at a depth of 0 to 2 feet below the surface during the months of December through April. Rare to occasional flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Native vegetation was tall prairie grasses.  Most of the soils are used for rice, soybeans, and grain sorghum, rotated with crayfish aquaculture and pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas (MLRA 150A, LRR T).  The series is of large extent.
