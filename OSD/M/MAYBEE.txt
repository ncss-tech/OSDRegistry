MAYBEE SERIES

The Maybee series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on remnant terraces in intermountain valleys and uplands. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Argicryolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - Remnant terraces
Elevation - 6,000 to 6,600 feet.
Slope - 0 to 2 percent.
Parent material - Mixed alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 19 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 39 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
     
These are the Beaverslide, Bighole, Cowcamp, Libeg and Mooseflat soils.  The Beaverslide soils have greater then 35 percent clay in the control section and occur on remnant terraces and fans, Bighole soils are fine-loamy and occur on remnant terraces and fans, Cowcamp soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on remnant terraces, and fans, Libeg soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on remnant terraces and fans in rangeland, Mooseflat soils are very poorly drained and occur on floodpains and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately slow permeability above the 2C horizon and rapid in the 2C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: Maybee soils are used for irrigated grass hay and irrigated pasture.  The vegetation is mainly Garrison creeping foxtail, meadow foxtail, timothy, tufted hairgrass, and other miscellaneous sedges, rushes and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Maybee soils are not extensive in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana.
