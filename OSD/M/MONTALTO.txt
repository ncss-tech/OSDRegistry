MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Berks County, Pennsylvania, 1909.

REMARKS: This 11/2009 revision updates the type location description and adjusts CEC activity class to semiactive, based on available data of five pedons. Three pedons were semiactive, one subactive and one active. Several pedons had CEC 8.4 data that used to make CEC 7.0 estimates. Competing series section was also revised.
Previous revision: 1/2006 WDC

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 14 inches (Ap and BE horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 14 to 46 inches (Bt horizons)
Ultic Hapludalfs subgroup  base saturation (by sum of cations) of more than 35 percent but less than 60 percent  at a depth of 1.25 meters below the top of the argillic horizon
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the NSSL for the following pedons: Soils sampled as S07MD015002 and 86MD510004. Particle size data is also available form the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.
