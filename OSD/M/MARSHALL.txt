MARSHALL SERIES

The Marshall series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on interfluves and hill slopes on uplands and on risers and treads on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 765 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lyon County, Minnesota, 1903.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A1, A2, BA, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 180 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, BA, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, Bw4, and BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 56 centimeters (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 56 to 180 centimeters (BA, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, Bg, BCg horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The gray colors and redoximorphic features are relict features related to a previous deoxidized and leached geological weathering zone. These colors are not indicative of present drainage conditions. These features were not considered in the classification of these soils.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data pedon user ID number 63IA029001, KSSL.
