MILOK SERIES

The Milok series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on structural benches, mesas, ridges, hillslope, fan remnants and fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and eolian materials derived from sandstone and limestone and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Milok loamy fine sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for air- dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; single grain; soft, very friable; few fine and very fine roots; slightly calcareous, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 12 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loamy fine sand, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; common very fine and fine roots; few fine pores; slightly calcareous, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

(12 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk2--25 to 47 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly calcareous, carbonates are disseminated and concentrated in masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    C--47 to 60 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) gravelly loamy sand, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; loose; slightly calcareous, carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abracon (UT), ThumbRock (UT), Chroder (CO), Chugcity (WY), Chupadera (NM), Cobbra (UT), Harvey (NM), Kaiar (UT), Mivida (UT), Nala (NM)(T), Sazi (UT), Smithpond (UT), and Yattle (CO)(T) series. ThumbRock, Chugcity, Chupadera, Kaiar, and Sazi soils are moderately deep.  Chroder soils are dryer in the soil moisture control section and receive only 7 to 10 inches of rain.  Cobbra soils contain 18 to 35 percent clay and average 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate in the particle-size control section.  Mivida and Yattle soils have a calcic horizon at 20 inches or deeper.  Harvey soils are moist in the control section during the spring and early summer months and contain 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Chugcity, Chupadera, Harvey, Nola, and Yattle soils are in the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Smithpond soils have mean annual soil temperature lower than 52 degrees F. and are in MLRA 34B-Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Milok soils are on structural benches, fan terraces, fan remnants, mesas and ridges.  Elevations range from 4,300 to 6,600 feet.  Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone and limestone.  The soils are in a warm, semiarid climate with average annual precipitation ranging from 9 to 14 inches. The precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight bulge in July, August, September and October.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Begay, Chipeta, and Mido soils.  Begay soils do not have a calcic horizon.  Chipeta soils have a paralithic contact at less than 20 inches.  Mido soils have a sandy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Potential vegetation is mainly blackbrush, Indian ricegrass, galleta and Mormon-tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Utah, Arizona, and; MLRAs is 35.  The series is extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Wayne County, Utah, Henry Mountains Area, 1985.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 4 inches (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 12 inches (Bw horizon)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 12 to 47 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches

Classification changed from Ustollic Calciorthids to Ustic Haplocalcids in 9/94.

The following statement was removed from the Range in Characteristics in the March 1993 update.  "The moist period occurs during the 4 months following the summer solstice."  There is a late summer and early fall spike in precipitation levels for the ustic aridic soils in Utah.  Based on the Newhall Simulations for Utah stations (1961 to 1990 normal) the soils are dry in the moisture control section during the 4 months following the summer solstice in spite of the higher precipitation levels in the late summer and early fall.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010

Updates and revisions for the correlation of Arches National Park (TU687), February 2009, CEM

Updated for the correlation of the Emery Area, Utah. Air and soil temperatures were adjusted to account for the differences between MLRA 34B and 35. Soils correlated as Milok in Utah have cooler air and soil temperatures and should be evaluated. April 2011 CEM.
