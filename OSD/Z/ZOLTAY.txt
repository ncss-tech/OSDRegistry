ZOLTAY SERIES

The Zoltay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Zoltay soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, and valley sideslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zoltay loam, in grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 10 percent sandstone fragments; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    BAt--8 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; 10 percent sandstone fragments; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--13 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) cobbly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent sandstone cobbles;  moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 24 inches thick)

    Bk1--22 to 31 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 30 percent sandstone cobbles; distinct fine and medium seams and soft masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent;  moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2--31 to 40 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) cobbly clay loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 30 percent sandstone cobbles; common medium and large seams of calcium carbonate;  violently effervescent;  moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons is 16 to 36 inches thick)

    Bk3--40 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) cobbly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent sandstone cobbles, 10 percent stones; disseminated and few faint soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the:  Chivington, Fughes, Hillery, Kubler, and Zeeland series.  
In addition, the following soils may be competitors when the classification is updated:  Savar series.

Chivington:  have peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.
Fughes:  are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches.  
Hillery and Kubler:  have hue of 5YR or redder.  
Savar:  have Bt horizons that are 35 to more than 60 inches thick, and have peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.
Zeeland:  have less than 10 percent rock fragments that are mostly gravel, and formed in glacial till on till plains.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks
Landform:  alluvial fans, terraces, and valley sideslopes
Slopes:  1 to 25 percent
Elevation: 6,000 to 8,500 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  41 to 45 degrees F.
