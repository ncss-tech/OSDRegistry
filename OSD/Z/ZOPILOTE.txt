ZOPILOTE SERIES

The Zopilote series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in debris flow deposits derived from sandstone and shale.  Zopilote soils are on debris flows.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zopilote very stony sandy clay loam, on a south facing, simple, 3 percent slope in pinyon-juniper at an elevation of 1,859 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on May 21, 1996 the soil was dry from 0 to 152 cm.  The surface is covered by 10 percent cobble, 20 percent stones, and 2 percent boulders.

    A--0 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very stony sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble, 15 percent stones, 2 percent boulders; slightly effervescent; carbonates disseminated; 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    C1--15 to 102 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) stratified very stony sandy loam and very stony loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine and medium pores; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble, 15 percent stones, 2 percent boulders; slightly effervescent; carbonates disseminated; 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (51 to 102 cm thick)

    C2--102 to 203 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) stratified extremely cobbly sandy loam and extremely cobbly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble, 5 percent stones, 5 percent boulders; slightly effervescent; carbonates disseminated; 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Archuleta County, Colorado, Archuleta soil survey area, 2002.  The name is taken from a mountain peak in the vicinity.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Stratified horizons - 15 to 203 cm (C1 and C2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - 25 to 100 cm (part of the C1 horizon)

Zopilote soils have a mesic temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
