ZIEGENFUSS SERIES

The Ziegenfuss series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. These soils formed in clayey ablation till overlying dense basal till. They are on till plains, wave-worked till plains, till-floored lake plains, end moraines, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 832 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, nonacid, mesic Mollic Epiaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Ziegenfuss clay, on a nearly level area in a cultivated field at an elevation of 210 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lenawee series. Lenawee soils have stratification within the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ziegenfuss soils are on nearly level or depressional areas on till plains, wave-worked till plains, till-floored lake plains, end moraines, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in clayey ablation till overlying dense basal till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 960 mm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free period is 110 to 210 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The moderately well drained Perrinton soils and the somewhat poorly drained Ithaca soils are in a drainage sequence with the Ziegenfuss soils. They are the common associates in MLRA 98. The somewhat poorly drained Blount and Arkona soils are common associates in MLRA 99. The Blount soils are on higher positions on the landscape. Arkona soils have 51 to 102 cm of sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying clayey till or lacustrine deposits and are on higher positions on the landscape. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 cm above the surface to 15 cm below the surface between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the solum and low or very low in the dense till substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, small grains, beans, and hay. A small part is in permanent pasture or in woodland of ash, red maple, shagbark hickory, basswood, and swamp white oak. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 99 in the southern half of lower Michigan. The type location is in MLRA 99. The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon (mollic intergrade): from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 18 to 97 cm (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 horizons).
Densic contact: at 147 cm (top of Cd1 horizon).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons between the surface layer and the densic contact.

A phase with a surface layer of human transported material has been correlated. This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable texture.
