ZOE SERIES

The Zoe series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty and clayey alluvium that is high in sodium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Cumulic Vertic Endoaquolls

   A1--20 to 28 centimeters (8 to 11 inches); black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak coarse angular blocky structure parting to moderate medium and fine angular blocky; hard, firm; sodium adsorption ratio = 9 dS/m, electrical conductivity = 2 mmhos/cm; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

   A2--28 to 41 centimeters (11 to 16 inches); black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak coarse platy structure parting to moderate fine angular blocky; hard, firm; sodium adsoption ratio = 13 dS/m, electrical conductivity = 4 mmhos/cm; common uncoated or clean silt and sand grains on ped faces; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the A horizon ranges from 66 to 102 centimeters (26 to 40 inches) thick)

   Cg--91 to 152 centimeters (36 to 60 inches); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; massive; very hard, very firm; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron masses; sodium adsorption ratio= 31 dS/m, electrical conductivity= 4 mmhos/cm; common fine iron manganese concretions and common medium and coarse calcium carbonate concretions; strong effervescence on calcium carbonate concretions; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chehalem, Clamo, Derrynane, Okoboji, Peotone,
Rantoul, Shiloh, Wabash and Zook soils. 
Clamo, Okoboji, Peotone and Zook soils contain less soluble salts and have a sodium adsorption ratio less than 13 dS/m in the series control section.
Chechalem soils have greater than 5 percent paragravel in the series control section and are in areas that have a mean annual precipitation range of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches).
Derrynane soils have a sand content of more than 30 percent in the lower one fourth of the series control section and have 2 to 8 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section.
Rantoul and Wabash have a clay content of more than 45 percent in the particle-size control section.
Shiloh soils are in areas that have a mean annual precipitation range of 91 to 109 centimeters (36 to 43 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: flood plains
Parent material: silty and clayey alluvium that is high in sodium
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Landform: lower part of the landscape commonly some distance from the main stream channel, in places dissected by channels because of stream straightening

Mean annual precipitation: 71 to 89 centimeters (28 to 35 inches)  
Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C. (51 to 57 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colo, Lamo, Saltine and Wabash soils.  
These soils are on similar positions as Zoe.  
Colo, Lamo, Saltine and Wabash soils contain less salts and sodium throughout the solum.  
Colo and Lamo soils are fine-silty.  
Wabash soils contain more clay.  
Saltine soils are fine-silty and lack a mollic epipedon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is cultivated.
Dryland crops are grain sorghum or wheat with small areas of irrigated corn. 
Minor acreage is in grass.  
Common grasses are switchgrass, wheatgrass and saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nebraska.  The series is not extensive.
