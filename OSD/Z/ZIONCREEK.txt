ZIONCREEK SERIES 

The Zioncreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terraces.  They formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Hapludalfs

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zioncreek soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with  minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers.  Elevation ranges from 2,100 to 2,400 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 32 inches and average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Artnoc, Caboose, Crash, Porthill, Rubson, and Wishbone soils.  Artnoc, Caboose, Crash, and Wishbone soils are on terrace escarpments and contain less volcanic ash.  Porthill soils are on terraces and have Bt horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  Rubson soils are on terraces and do not have Bk horizons and are coarse-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, wildlife habitat, recreation, and dry-farm cropland.  The principal crops are small grains, alfalfa hay, and pasture.  Some areas are used for tree nurseries and homesites.  Natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, Douglas-fir, grand fir, and western larch, with an understory of longtube twinflower, queencup beadlily, starry false Solomons seal, darkwoods violet, bunchberry dogwood, baldhip rose, elk sedge, Oregon fairybells, pine reedgrass, and white spirea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana and northeastern Washington.  The series is not extensive.
