ZATOVILLE SERIES

The Zatoville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or alluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zatoville silty clay loam, in grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(3 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 21 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

   BC--46 to 52 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots few very fine pores; common reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) iron stains; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 24 inches thick)

    Cr--52 to 60 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) semiconsolidated shale that crushes to silty clay loam; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few primary gypsum crystals; very strongly acid (pH 4.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Rosebud County, Montana; 1,800 feet west and 400 feet north of the SE corner of sec. 5 T. 11 N., R. 38 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil temperature - 43 to 47 degrees F.

Moisture control section - between 4 and 12 inches, dry in all parts of the moisture control section between four-tenths and five-tenths of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F or higher.
