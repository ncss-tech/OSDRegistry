ZYLSTRA SERIES

The Zylstra series consists of moderately deep to densic contact, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in compacted glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits.  Zylstra soils are on hillslopes and outwash plains at elevations from 40 to 90 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm.  The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, mesic Aquic Humixerepts

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Morancreek and Roche series.  Morancreek soils do not have a densic contact, and are 38 to 75 cm to redoximorphic features.   Roche soils have an ochric epipedon, and are 46 to 91 cm to redoximorphic features.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zylstra soils are on hills and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils are formed in compacted glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations range from 40 to 90 meters.  These soils occur in a mild marine climate with warm dry summers and mild wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 635 to 1016 mm, most of which falls as rain in the late fall, winter and early spring.  The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.  The frost-free period is about 200-240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Coveland and Mitchellbay series.  Coveland soils are in drainageways and valleys on glacial outwash plains.  Coveland soils are fine-loamy and do not have a densic contact above 100 cm.  Mitchellbay soils are on similar landscape positions as Zylstra soils.  Mitchellbay soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the A, E, and Bg horizons, and very low in the Cd horizon.  Zylstra soils have a perched water table as high as 23 cm from December through February and from 46 to 81 cm during October and March. At lower slope ranges, Zylstra soils are subject to occasional ponding for very brief durations from December to March.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Zylstra soils are used for home sites, timber production, crop production, and livestock grazing. Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, Douglas-fir, grand fir, lodgepole pine, red alder, common snowberry, trailing blackberry, salmonberry, stinging nettle, salal, swordfern, and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Washington; MLRA 2.  Series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Island County, Washington, 2009.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Albic horizon - the zone from 30 to 46 cm (E horizon) 
Densic contact - 94 cm.  (upper boundary of Cd horizon)
Particle size control section - 25 to 94 cm (to the Cd horizon)
Depth to redoximorphic features - 30 cm 

Most of the area mapped as Zylstra was previously mapped as Swantown in the 1950 Island County soil survey.  Swantown soils are loamy-skeletal and have a Bsm, or cemented horizon.
