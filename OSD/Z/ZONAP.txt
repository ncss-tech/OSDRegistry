ZONAP SERIES

The Zonap series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. The Zonap soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm (8 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Xeric Torriorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Zonap loam, on an east facing slope of 57 percent under Goldenbush and Ephedra at 960 meters (3,150 feet) elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described on January 07, 1991 the soil was slightly moist throughout.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; 15 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 cm [1 to 4 in] thick)

    A2--8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; 15 percent clay; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; common very fine interstitial and few fine and medium tubular pores; strongly effervescent; carbonates disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 23 cm [5 to 9 in] thick)

    C--25 to 66 cm (10 to 26 in); pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) fine sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; 15 percent clay; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine interstitial and few very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.(25 to 51 cm [10 to 20 in] thick)

    Cr--66 cm (26 in); moderately cemented shale.

TYPE LOCATION: Kern County, California, Southwest Part; about 65 kilometers (40 miles) west of downtown Bakersfield; about 670 meters (2,200 feet) north and 500 meters (1,640 feet) east of the southwest corner of section 31, T. 31 S., R. 22 E.; Mount Diablo Base and Meridian; latitude 35 degrees, 10 minutes, 52 seconds north and longitude 119 degrees, 39 minutes, 42 seconds west; USGS Panorama Hills, California, Quadrangle, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 16 to 20 degrees C (60 to 68 degrees F). The soils have a thermic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic. The soil moisture control section is moist in some part from late December until April and is moist in all parts for 45 consecutive days and is dry in all parts for more than 180 days.

Diagnostic feature(s):
  Ochric epipedon thickness: 10 to 25 cm
  Depth to paralithic contact: 50 to 100 cm 

Particle size control section weighted average:

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Premier series. Premier series formed in granitic alluvium on terraces and to not have a lithic or paralithic contact within 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Zonap soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 15 to 75 percent. The Zonap soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and shale. Elevations are 774 to 1,429 meters (2,535 to 4,685 feet). The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 203 to 254 mm (8 to 10 in). Average January temperature is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F); average July temperature is about 25 degrees C (77 degrees F); mean annual temperature is about 16 to 18 degrees C (60 to 64 degrees F). The average frost-free season is about 150 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ballinger, Beam, Harrisranch, Padres, and Pleito soils. Ballinger soils, on hills, have a fine particle-size class, have a smectitic mineralogy class, and have a gypsic horizon. Beam soils, on hills and mountains, are shallow, have a loamy particle-size class, and have a cambic horizon. Harrisranch soils, on mountain slopes, are very deep, have a mesic temperature regime, and have a pachic mollic epipedon. Padres soils, on alluvial fans, alluvial flats and plains, are very deep, and have a calcic horizon. Pleito soils, on terraces, fan remnants, erosional remnants and alluvial fans, are very deep, have a fine-loamy particle-size class, have a mollic epipedon, and have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and some dry farmed grain. Natural vegetation is mainly red brome, filaree, goldenbush, ephedra, and buckwheat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hills and mountains of the Temblor and Caliente ranges in California, MLRA 15. These soils are moderately extensive.
