ZELLMONT SERIES


The Zellmont series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over residuum derived from shale. Zellmont soils are on strath terraces in River Valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches (74 centimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F (14 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Udic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Zellmont sandy loam on a southwest facing, convex, 3 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 1447 feet (441 meters). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on 12/10/96 the soil was moist from 0 to 80 inches (0 to 203 centimeters).

Ap--0 to 8 inches (0 to 20 centimeters); brown (10YR 4/3), interior, sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), interior, moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 18 percent clay; noneffervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); 2 percent subrounded mixed gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick; 13 to 30 centimeters thick)

Bt1--8 to 18 inches (20 to 46 centimeters); reddish brown (5YR 5/3), interior, clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3), interior, moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots throughout; 28 percent clay; few distinct continuous clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; noneffervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); 3 percent subrounded mixed gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

Bt2--18 to 26 inches (46 to 66 centimeters) ; reddish brown (5YR 5/4), interior, coarse sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4), interior, moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; 12 percent clay; few distinct continuous clay films on vertical and horizontal faces of peds; noneffervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); 3 percent subrounded mixed gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (14 to 25 inches thick; 36 to 64 centimeters thick)

2C--26 to 32 inches (66 to 81 centimeters); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3), interior, clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3), interior, moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 27 percent clay; noneffervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal); 4 percent subrounded mixed gravel and 10 percent subrounded shale gravel; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 22 inches thick; 0 to 56 centimeters thick)

2Cr--32 to 80 inches (81 to 203 centimeters); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/3), interior, weathered bedrock, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/3), interior, moist; noneffervescent throughout (HCl, 1 normal)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Heflin (CO), Nickerson (KS), and Spelvin (KS) series. The Heflin soils have a lower mean annual soil temperatures and lower mean annual precipitation. The very deep Nickerson soils have a seasonal high water table. The Spelvin soils are very deep. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zellmont soils
