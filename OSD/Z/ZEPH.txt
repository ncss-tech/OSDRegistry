ZEPH SERIES

The Zeph series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed riverine alluvium.  Zeph soils are on flood plains.  Permeability is slow over very rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aeric Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zeph silty clay -- on a 1 percent slope at 4880 feet elevation in pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on October 17, 1991, the soil was moist from the surface to 24 inches and a water table was present at 24 inches).

    Oe--0 to 3 inches; moderately decomposed roots.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    Ag--3 to 8 inches; gray (N 5/0) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 9 inches thick)

    2Cg1--8 to 19 inches; gray (N 6/0) very gravelly coarse sand, dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) moist; single grain; loose; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 11 inches thick)

    2Cg2--19 to 22 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/8) extremely gravelly coarse sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; single grain; loose; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 60 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 19 inches thick)

    2Cg3--22 to 26 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) extremely gravelly coarse sand, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations on coarse fragments; single grain; loose; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 60 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 22 inches thick)

    2Cg4--26 to 63 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly coarse sand; many fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations on coarse fragments; single grain; loose; few very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.3).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lemhi County, Idaho; about 16 miles southeast of Salmon, Idaho, about 1,300 feet north and 250 feet west of the southeast corner of section 6, T.19N. R.24E.  Latitude - 45 degrees, 00 minutes, 8 seconds, North; Longitude - 115 degrees, 39 minutes, 38 seconds, West.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Canarway series.  Canarway soils typically will average less than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zeph series are on flood plains.  These soils formed in mixed riverine alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 4,200 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ajax and Wimpey soils.  Ajax soils are in depressions on flood plains and have fine textured particle-size control sections and mollic epipedons.  Wimpey soils are on smooth positions on flood plains and have contrasting particle-size control sections and mollic epipedons that are greater than 20 inches thick.  Ajax soils are in depressions on flood plains and Wimpey soils are on smooth positions on flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Slow runoff. Permeability is slow over very rapid.  This soil floods occasionally for brief periods in January through June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for flood irrigated grass hay and pasture.  The principle native vegetation is sedges, western wheatgrass and willows.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lemhi County, Idaho, 1999.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon 

Particle-size control section - the zone from 13 to 43 inches (part of the 2Cg1 horizon, the 2Cg2 horizon, 2Cg3 horizon and part of the 2Cg4 horizon)

All depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.
