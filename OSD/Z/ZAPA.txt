ZAPA SERIES

The Zapa series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Zapa soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Ellum series.

Ellum soils lack subhorizons above the duripan with firm consistence and a brittle manner of failure when moist.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zapa soils are on fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chuska, Deepeek, and Jackpot soils.  Chuska and Deepeek soils have argillic horizons and indurated duripans.  Jackpot soils are ashy and shallow to paralithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Zapa soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, shadscale, bottlebrush squirreltail, and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 25.
