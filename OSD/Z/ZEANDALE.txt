ZEANDALE SERIES

The Zeandale series includes very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified calcareous silty alluvium. Permeability is moderate. These soils are on flood plain steps and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Zeandale silt loam - with a slope of less than l percent in a cultivated field. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (l0YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (l0YR 6/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  C1--5 to 16 inches; grayish brown (l0YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (l0YR 7/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  C2--16 to 31 inches; grayish brown (l0YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (l0YR 6/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  C3--31 to 51 inches; 60 percent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and 40 percent grayish brown (l0YR 4/2) silt loam, grayish brown (l0YR 4/2) dry; massive; soft; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic white masses of lime above 52 inches; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

  C4--51 to 59 inches; 70 percent very dark brown (l0YR 2/2) and 30 percent dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (l0YR 4/2) dry; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clearly smooth boundary.

  2Ab--59 to 73 inches; dark gray (l0YR 4/l) silty clay loam, gray (l0YR 6/l) dry; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Carruthersville, Jules, and Severn, series.  The Carruthersville and Severn soils are thermic. The Carruthersville soil has redoximorphic concentrations below 20 inches. The Severn soil has a higher precipitation range. The Jules soil 
are on tributary streams.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  derived from calcareous coarse-silty alluvium
Landform:  floodplain step
Slopes:  0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature:  52 to 57 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  34 to 40 inches
Precipitation pattern:  udic
Frost-free period:  170 to 190 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belvue, Bismarckgrove, Bourbonais (T), Eudora, Fluvaquents, Kimo, Muscotah, Reading, Rossville (T) and Stonehouse (T), and Wabash soils. The Belvue soils are calcareous below 20 inches. The Bismarckgrove soils are fine-silty and occur somewhat higher on the flood plain. The Bourbonais (T) soils are coarse-silty over sandy and sit on similar landscapes. The Eudora soils have a mollic epipedon and are similar or slightly higher on the flood plain. Fluvaquents soils are non-calcareous to calcareous, well drained to somewhat poorly drained and are slightly lower on flood plain. Kimo soils are clayey over loamy and are lower on the flood plain. The Muscotah soils are fine and somewhat poorly drained and are higher on the flood plain. The Reading soils have an argillic horizon and are higher on the flood plain. The Rossville soils are fine-silty and are higher on the flood plains. The Stonehouse (T) soils are sandy and are on similar position on the flood plain. The Wabash soils are fine and are higher on the flood plain.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow runoff, moderate permeability, occasionally flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is in cultivated crops. The principal crops are alfalfa, corn, grain sorghum, and soybeans. Many areas are irrigated. A smaller acreage is in native grass and used for grazing or hay meadow. Big bluestem, switchgrass and Indiangrass are the most common native grasses

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRA 106; Kansas River Valley; very limited extent.
