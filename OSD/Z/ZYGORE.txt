SERIES ESTABLISHED: Multnomah County, Oregon; 1977

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 8 to 56 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 33 to 108 cm
*Andic soil properties--zone from 8 to 33 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from 8 to 33 cm

6/1998--Additional data on andic properties needed to confirm classification of the andic subgroup or Andisol order. Classification should be similar to the mesic counterpart Aschoff series and the frigid, moderately deep Dougan series.

8/2016--Layers with andic soil properties assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for those layers to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence
