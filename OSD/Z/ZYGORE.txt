SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Multnomah County, Oregon; 1977

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 33 to 108 cm
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 8 to 56 cm
*Andic subgroup feature--zone from 8 to 33 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from 8 to 33 cm

09/2023--laboratory data for geographically associated soils supports andic subgroup criteria in the epipedon. All mineral horizons fall short of andic soil property criteria.

6/1998--additional data on andic properties needed to confirm classification of the andic subgroup or Andisol order. Classification should be similar to the mesic counterpart Aschoff series and the frigid, moderately deep Dougan series.
