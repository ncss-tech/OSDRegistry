ZOLFO SERIES

The Zolfo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy marine sediments.  Zolfo soils are on ridges, rises, and knolls on adjacent flatwoods on marine terraces.  Slopes are linear to convex and range from 0 to 5 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches).
