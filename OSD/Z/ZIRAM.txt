ZIRAM SERIES

The Ziram series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, tuffaceous sandstone, quartzite and quartz latite.  Ziram soils are on smooth mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Depth to carbonates: 40 to 69 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  45 to 55 percent.
Rock fragments:  40 to 55 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Structure:  Granular or platy.

Bt horizon
Hue:  Some pedons reflect hue of the parent material in their lower subhorizons.
Value:  4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 to 6 dry, 3 to 6 moist.
Texture:  Very gravelly clay, very cobbly clay, extremely cobbly clay with a thin upper subhorizon of gravelly clay common in most pedons.
Rock fragments:  25 to 40 percent gravel and 10 to 15 percent cobbles in the upper part; 15 to 40 percent gravel and 35 to 55 percent cobbles and stones in the lower part.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amboat, Aninto, Durfee, Ebic and Secrepass series.  

Amboat, Durfee and Ebic soils lack carbonates in the lower part of their argillic horizon.  Aninto soils have a Mollic epipedon extending into the Bt horizon. Secrepass soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ziram soils are on smooth mountain side slopes.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, tuffaceous sandstone, quartzite and quartz latite.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,985 to 2,475 meters.  The climate is cool and semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bregar, Freznik, and Softscrabble soils.  Bregar soils are shallow to unweathered bedrock.  Freznik soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Softscrabble soils have less than 35 percent clay in their particle-size control section and have a thick Mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, lanceleaf rabbitbrush, lupine, locoweed, Sandberg bluegrass, Nevada bluegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.
