ZZYZX SERIES

The Zzyzx series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium derived from igneous rock. The Zzyzx soils are on fan aprons and fan skirts. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carsitas, Dalelake, Joetree, Lagunita (AZ), Myoma, Pintobasin and Rositas series. Carsitas and Rositas soils are dry for most of the year in the moisture control section. Carsitas and Pintobasin soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Dalelake and Rositas soils formed in eolian parent material. Joetree soils have a buried argillic horizon with 16 to 28 percent clay with an upper boundary of 100 to 125 cm. Lagunita soils formed in stratified stream alluvium on floodplains with an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Myoma soils have clam and conch shells throughout the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Zzyzx soils are on fan aprons and fan skirts. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in sandy alluvium derived from igneous rock. Elevation ranges from 280 to 590 meters (~920 to 1,940 feet). The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 mm (~ 3 to 5 in.). The mean annual air temperature is about 20 to 23 degrees C (~68 to 73 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buzzardsprings, Dalelake, and Pintobasin soils. Buzzardlake soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants with a calcic horizon. Dalelake soils are on eolian sand sheets and sand dunes. Pintobasin soils are on fan aprons and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Zzyzx soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is creosote bush, burrobush and cattle saltbush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Basin and Range of California, U.S.A.; MLRA 30. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Bernardino County, California, Soil Survey of Mojave National Preserve Area, California, 2022. The name is from historical Zzyzx site on Soda Lake.
