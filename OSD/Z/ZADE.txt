ZADE SERIES

The Zade series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in interbedded sandstone and shale residuum.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zade loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter.  (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--1 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--10 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--16 to 37 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; 5 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is 14 to 30 inches).

    Cr--37 to 60 inches; olive (5Y 5/3) interbedded soft sandstone and shale.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1607.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from 1 to 16 inches (A and Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 10 to 37 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); a semiconsolidated layer of interbbeded sandstone and shale from 36 to 60 inches (Cr horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 30 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons). Zade soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
