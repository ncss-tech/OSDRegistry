ZAU SERIES

The Zau series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  Zau series are on hills, mesas, plateaus, mountains, cuestas, and structural benches, and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zau stony loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; organic material consisting of leaves and bark.

    Oe--2 to 4 inches; organic material consisting of partly decomposed plant material.

    A1--4 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable; many medium and fine roots; few pores; 2 percent stones and cobble; 5 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR through 2.5Y
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3 dry or moist
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR through 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma: 3 through 6 (Colors are commonly variegated due to the nature of the parent material.)
