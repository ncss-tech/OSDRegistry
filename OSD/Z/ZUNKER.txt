ZUNKER SERIES

The Zunker series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvial deposits. These nearly level soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 74 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, superactive, hyperthermic Fluventic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Zunker fine sandy loam occasionally flooded, on a west-facing, 0.5 percent slope in pastureland at an elevation of 72 m (235 ft) (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

[25 to 94 cm (10 to 37 in) thick]

    Bw2--104 to 152 cm (41 to 60 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, very friable; very few fine roots; few snail shell fragments; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [20 to 97 cm (8 to 38 in)]

    Ab--152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; very few fine roots in upper part; few snail shell fragments; few thin films and fine threads of calcium carbonate on ped surfaces; 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Karnes County, Texas; from the intersection of Texas Highway 72 and Farm Road 792 in Kenedy, 1.1 mile north on Farm Road 792 to county road; 5 miles east on county road; 23 meters (75 ft) south in pastureland. The latitude is 28 degrees 53 minutes 18 seconds north and the longitude is 97 degrees 47 minutes 08 seconds west; NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: An ustic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 90 but less than 180 days in normal years.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this same family. Similar soils are the Boerne, Conalb, Lagloria, Santo, Yahola and Zavala series. 
Boerne and Conalb soils: have carbonatic mineralogy. In addition, Boerne soils have a thermic soil temperature regime.
Lagloria soils: have less than 18 percent coarser than very fine sand. 
Zavala soils: are noncalcareous throughout. 
Santo and Yahola soils: do not have a cambic horizon.  In addition, Santo and Yahola soils have a thermic soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Buchel, Odem, and Sinton soils. 
The Buchel soils: are clayey throughout. 
Odem soils: are noncalcareous, have dark surface layers. 
Sinton soils: have dark surface layers. 
All of these soils: are on slightly lower flood plain positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: well.
Permeability class: moderately rapid. 
Runoff: negligible.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Zunker soils are farmed to grain sorghum, wheat, or corn. Native vegetation is dominantly bluestems, fourflower trichloris, vine mesquite, big sandbur, switchgrass, Texas wintergrass, and hackberry trees. The Ecological Site is Loamy Bottomland (083AY573TX).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the eastern part of the Northern Rio Grande Plain Major Land Resource Area. It is along the San Antonio River and its major tributaries. The series is of minor extent.
