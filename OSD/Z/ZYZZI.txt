ZYZZI SERIES

The Zyzzi series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic rock. The Zyzzi soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zyzzi very gravelly sandy loam, rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 5 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and common very fine roots; common fine and many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt--5 to 15 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium and fine, and many very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; 60 percent fine gravel; many faint and distinct, few prominent clay films on faces of peds and lining in pores and bridging sand grains; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    Cr--15 cm; soft, weathered granitic rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada; about 5 miles east of Flying M Ranch headquarters; 450 feet north and 1,550 feet west of the southeast corner of section 36, T. 9 N., R. 27 E.; USGS Mitchell Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 38 degrees, 35 minutes, 29 seconds north latitude, 118 degrees, 54 minutes, 45 seconds west longitude; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.5913889 latitude, -118.9125000  longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall except for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms, aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 10 to 25 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  20 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  50 to 75 percent, mostly less than 5 mm in diameter.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bt horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 through 5.
Clay content:  25 to 35.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abalan, Alcan, Armoine, Berit, Bouncer, Entero, Flex, Ginex, Harvan, Penelas, Ravenell, Sedsked, Soar, and Stodick series.  
Alcan and Bouncer soils have less than 25 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Abalan have carbonates at 8 to 20 cm.  Alcan soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 14 degrees C.  Bouncer soils are not dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter rock fragments.  Armoine and Stodick soils are 36 to 50 cm to bedrock.  Entero soils have less than 45 percent sand in Bt horizon and the rock fragments are mostly greater than 5 millimeters.  Berit, Flex, Ginex, Sedsked, Soar, and Stodick soils lack summer moisture. Harvan soils have densic materials at 30 to 50 cm.  Penelas soils have less than 35 percent sand. Ravenell soils have a B2t horizon with 35 to 45 percent clay and gravel that are dominantly from 5 to 75 millimeters in diameter.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zyzzi soils are on hills and mountains. These soils formed in residuum from granitic bedrock. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,670 to 2,140 meters.  Mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. Frost- free season is 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chill, Shoken, and Uripnes series. Chill soils are loamy.  Shoken and Uripnes soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is low sagebrush and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 29.
