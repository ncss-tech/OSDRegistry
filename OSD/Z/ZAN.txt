ZAN SERIES

The Zan series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 4 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic Vitrixerandic Humicryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Zan fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, forested -- on a northwest-facing slope of 50 percent at 6,400 feet elevation. When described on July 15, 1997, the soil moist throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

  Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed forest litter. 

  A1--1 to 3 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 15 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. 

  A2--3 to 14 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine gravelly ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 20 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary. (combined A horizon - 7 to 24 inches thick) 

  AB--14 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 25 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 20 inches thick) 

  Bw--24 to 35 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 20 percent fine gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 16 inches thick) 

  2C--35 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.9).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Belsh and Montchief series in a closely related family are sandy-skeletal. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zan soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and canyon walls at elevations of 4,700 to 7,350 feet. These soils formed in colluvium from granitic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 4 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is 28 to 40 inches. The average annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belsh and Montchief soils. Belsh and Montchief soils are sandy-skeletal and on similar geomorphic positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; medium to rapid runoff; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Zan soils are used mainly for timber production, woodland grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is subalpine fir, Douglas-fir, mountain maple and thinleaf (blue) huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Idaho. MLRA 43b. Zan soils are not extensive.
