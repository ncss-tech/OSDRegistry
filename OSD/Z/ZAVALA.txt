ZAVALA SERIES

The Zavala series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in loamy alluvium.  These frequently flooded soils are on nearly level to gently undulating flood plains in drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature range is 23 degrees C (72 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation range is 737 mm (29 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, hyperthermic Typic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zavala fine sandy loam in rangeland; elevation is 125 meters (410 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 36 cm (0 to 14 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 51 cm [6 to 20 in] thick)

     C--36 to 152 cm (14 to 60 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; common evident strata of loam and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy fine sand; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Wilson County, Texas; 11 miles northwest of Floresville on U.S. Highway 181, then 1 mile in a westerly direction on county road and 50 feet from the western creek bank of Calaveras Creek and 50 feet from road. Saspamco, Texas USGS topographic quadrangle, Latitude: 29 degrees, 14 minutes, 13.62 seconds N; Longitude: 98 degrees, 17 minutes, 12.476 seconds W.; NAD 83).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: A typic-ustic moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 90 days but less than 180 cumulative days in normal years.  June through August and December through February are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May.
Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 23 degrees C (72 to 74 degrees F)

Particle-size control section (weighted average)
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
Sand content: 50 to 85 percent

A horizon

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Camargo (TX), Pulaski (OK), Rio Grande (TX), Yahola (OK) and Zalla (TX) series. 
Camargo and Rio Grande soils: average less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand within the particle-size control section.
Camargo soils: have more than 18 percent clay.  
Pulaski and Yahola soils: have mean annual soil temperatures less than 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).  
Zalla soils: are loamy fine sand or fine sand in the 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 inch) particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy alluvium sediments
Landscape: inland dissected coastal plain
Landforms: nearly level to gently undulating flood plains on drainageways
Slope: 0 to 2 percent. 
Mean annual air temperature range: 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 74 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 660 to 813 mm (26 to 32 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 36 to 44

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Alum (TX), Lemming (TX), Wilco (TX) and Zalla (TX) series. 

Alum, Lemming and Wilco soils: have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section; are on a higher landscape position
Zalla soils: are on a slightly position on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland, cropland, and pasture.  The main crops are grain sorghum, corn, cotton, and small grains used for grazing.  Pastures are mainly bermudagrass or Johnsongrass.  Range vegetation is little bluestem, bristlegrass, Texas wintergrass, silver bluestem, buffalograss, mesquite, huisache, and spiny hackberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I; MLRA 83A, 83B.  The series is of moderate extent.
