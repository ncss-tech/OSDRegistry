ZUNDELL SERIES

The Zundell series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium. These soils form on terraces on valley floors and the lower parts of fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

 Slope: 0 to 2 percent
 Parent material: silty alluvium over mixed alluvium
 Mean annual air temperature: 3.3 to 6.7 degrees C 
 Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 457 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedron, Zohner, and Foxcreek soils.  Cedron soils are on nearby flood plains and oxbows adjacent to rivers.  Zohner soils are on relatively lower flats and terraces.  Foxcreek soils are on drainageways that cross fan remnants or terraces.  Cedron, Zohner, and Foxcreek all have aquic moisture regimes.

 Dominant native vegetation: Shrubby cinquefoil, slender wheat grass, baltic rush (and   
 other rushes), sedges, and redtop

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from a depth of 0 to 43 cm; this pedon meets mollic criteria by having a 	fine-earth fraction that has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 40 percent or more 	and a color value, moist of 5 or less; some other pedons meet mollic criteria by being 18 to 25 centimeters thick (after mixing the upper 18 cm of mineral soil) 	and one-third or more of the total thickness between the mineral soil surface and the upper boundary of any identifiable secondary carbonates
Calcic horizon: from a depth of 69 to 107 cm
Calcium carbonate equivalent: greater than 40 percent in the particle size control section
Redoximorphic features (iron concentrations/depletions): beginning at a depth of 94 cm
Particle size control section: from a depth of 25 to 100 cm 
Soil temperature regime: cryic
Soil moisture regime: xeric
