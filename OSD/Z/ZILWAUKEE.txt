ZILWAUKEE SERIES

The Zilwaukee series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on flood plains that ocur on lake plains. They formed in clayey alluvium over clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.7 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, calcareous, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Zilwaukee silty clay, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 179 meters (587 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay, gray (2.5Y 5/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak medium granular; firm; fine medium and common fine roots throughout; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

 A--15 to 33 cm (6 to 13 inches); very dark gray (2.5Y 3/1) silty clay, gray (2.5Y 5/1) dry; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine and few medium roots throughout; common fine distinct gray (5Y 5/1) iron depletions and common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches) thick.]

 2C1--33 to 74 cm (13 to 29 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) silty clay; weak medium and thin platy structure inherent from deposition; firm; many fine roots throughout; many light gray (10YR 7/1) silt coatings on horizontal plates; common white (10YR 8/1) snail shells on horizontal plates; common fine very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) iron-manganese concentrations on horizontal plates; many white (10YR 8/1) irregular masses of calcium carbonates; common fine prominent gray (5Y 6/1) iron depletions; many coarse faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 2C2--74 to 203 cm (29 to 80 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay; weak medium and thin platy structure inherent from deposition; firm; many fine roots throughout; many light gray (10YR 7/1) silt coatings on horizontal plates; common white (10YR 8/1) snail shells on horizontal plates; common fine very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) iron-manganese concentrations on horizontal plates; many white (10YR 8/1) irregular masses of calcium carbonates; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Saginaw County, Michigan; about 5.5 miles east-northeast of the village of St. Charles; 1250 feet west and 2050 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 30, T. 11 N., R. 4 E., James Township; USGS Alicia topographic quadrangle; UTM Zone 16, 740229n and 4801432e, NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Particle-size control section: averages 35 to 60 percent clay
Series control section: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 2, 2.5 or 3
Chroma: l or 2
Texture: silty clay, silty clay loam, or silt loam

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 1 to 6
Texture: silty clay loam, silty clay or clay

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in this family. Closely related are the Charity and Saranac series. Charity soils are frigid and the Saranac soils are noncalcareous.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Zilwaukee soils are on flood plains that occur on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 802 to 824 mm (31.6 to 32.4 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.3 to 8.9 degrees C (47 to 48 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 137 to 189 days. Elevation is 175 to 186 meters (574 to 610 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ceresco, Roundhead, and Sloan soils. The Ceresco soils are coarser textured and are on slightly higher landscape positions on the floodplains. The Roundhead soils have a histic epipedon and are in shallow depressions. The Sloan soils are coarser textured and are not calcareous.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Depth to top of an apparent seasonal high water table is at or just below the surface between October and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow. These soils are subject to flooding in late fall to spring.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, sugar beets, soybeans and small grain are the principal crops. Native vegetation is chiefly red and silver maple, swamp white oak, white ash, and alder.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in Lower Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
