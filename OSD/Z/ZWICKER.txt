ZWICKER SERIES

The Zwicker series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from calcareous shale.  Zwicker soils are on knobs, ridges, and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Chromic Haplotorrerts

TYPICAL PEDON: Zwicker stony clay loam, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones.

    A1--0 to 1 inch; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) stony clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 4 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bss--4 to 10 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky with slickensides; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

    Bssky--10 to 17 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky with slickensides; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine irregular seams and soft masses of calcium carbonate; many fine gypsum crystals; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 15 inches thick)

    Bky--17 to 32 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; vertical cracks from the surface terminate in this horizon; many fine irregular seams and soft masses of calcium carbonate; many fine gypsum crystals; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

    Cr--32 inches; soft, fissile shale.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Colona, Puerco and Unkee series. Colona, Puerco, and Unkee soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material: alluvium and colluvium derived from calcareous shale

Landform: knobs, ridges, and hills

Slopes: 3 to 12 percent

Elevation: 5,000 to 5,700 feet

Mean annual temperature: 52 to 56 degrees F

Mean annual precipitation: 8 to 10 inches

Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with July and August being slightly wetter and June being slightly dryer. 

Frost-free period: 135 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Claysprings and Mack soils.  Claysprings soils have a paralithic contact at less than 20 inches.  Mack soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, medium to very high runoff, slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for grazing.  Native vegetation is mainly shadscale, galleta, alkali sacaton, and saline wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado.  LRR D, MLRA 35.  This series is of small extent.
