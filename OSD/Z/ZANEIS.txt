ZANEIS SERIES 

The Zaneis series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale of Permian age. These soils are on crests and side slopes of low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 860 millimeters (34 in).
