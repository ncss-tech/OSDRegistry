ZOLA SERIES

The Zola series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in recent alluvium from volcaniclastic materials.  They are on stream terraces and floodplains.  Permeability is slow or moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zola loam -- on a slope of 1 percent under rangeland vegetation at 1,680 meters elevation.  (When described on September 26, 1979, the soil profile was slightly moist throughout.  Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 cm thick)

    Bw1--13 to 33 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 53 cm thick)

    Bw2--33 to 53 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular or blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slight effervescence (12 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

(15 to 33 cm thick)

    Bk2--71 to 99 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slight effervescence (9 percent calcium carbonate); carbonates occur in few fine irregularly shaped soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 38 cm thick)

    2Bk1--99 to 137 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slight effervescence (7 percent calcium carbonate); carbonates occur in few fine irregularly shaped soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 46 cm thick)

    2Bk2--137 to 178 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) gravelly sandy clay, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; common fine faint mottles (7.5YR 4/6) moist; 30 percent gravel; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine tubular pores; slight effervescence (6 percent calcium carbonate); carbonates occur in few fine irregularly shaped soft masses; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Koosharem and Toehead series.  Koosharem soils have less than 27 percent clay in the control section.  Koosharem and Toehead soils are well drained and lack mottles.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zola soils are on stream terraces and floodplains.  The slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in recent alluvium from volcaniclastic materials.  Elevations are 1,345 to 1,785 meters.  The average annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm and the average annual temperature is 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Aninto and Tucker soils.  Aninto soils are clayey-skeletal, well drained, and occur on terrace sideslopes.  Tucker soils are fine, somewhat poorly drained, and occur on lower terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow or slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Zola soils are used mainly for rangeland, irrigated hayland, and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is Idaho fescue, basin wildrye, bluebunch wheatgrass, bluegrass, big sagebrush, and carex.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Zola soils are of small extent in southern Idaho and in northern Nevada.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.
