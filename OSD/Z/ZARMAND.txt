ZARMAND SERIES

The Zarmand series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone over residuum weathered from limestone. Zarmand soils are on beveled summits of hills. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.  The Guy series, in a closely related family, is not calcareous throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zarmand soils are on beveled summits of hills. They formed in alluvium derived from Pennsylvanian Age limestone and sandstone over residuum weathered from limestone. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Legate and Yohalem soils. Legate soils are loamy-skeletal, have a lithic contact within 20 inches, and occur on backslopes of hills. Yohalem soils are clayey, have a paralithic contact within 20 inches, and occur on backslopes of shale hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Zarmand soils are used for urban development, cord wood products, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, eriogonum, Bigelow's rubber rabbitbrush, oneseed juniper, twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma/Cercocarpus montanus-Chrysothamnus nauseosus/Bouteloua gracilis (F036XB135NM)..

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Zarmand soils are of small extent on the southwestern Sangre de Cristo part of the Southern Rocky Mountains province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 49.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008. Zarmand is a coined name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 9 inches. (Ak and ABk horizons)
Calcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 24 inches. (Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons). The upper boundary was placed at 9 inches because the most significant increase in carbonate content was judged to be at that depth.
Paralithic contact - Moderately cemented limestone bedrock at 24 inches. (2Crk layer)
Lithic contact - Indurated limestone bedrock at 29 inches. (2R layer)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 24 inches (part of Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 29 inches.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006..

ADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter.
