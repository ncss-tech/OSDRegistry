ZENAS SERIES

The Zenas series consists of deep, well drained soils on hills and sinkholes. They formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying residuum from limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Zenas silt loam on a 3 percent slope in a pasture. Elevation is 192 meters (630 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Marseilles, Mentor, Pottersville, Sandview, Stubenville, and Westmore series.  Marseilles soils have a paralithic contact above 102 cm (40 inches).  Mentor, Pottersville, Sandview and Stubenville soils do not have a lithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches).  Westmore soils have fragments of shale and sandstone lithology in the upper part of the solum.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zenas soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping hills and sinkholes of benched uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. Many areas are undulating to rolling karst topography. The upper 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of the solum formed in loess and the lower part formed in limestone residuum. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 107 to 240 meters (350 feet to 800 feet).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deputy, Muscatatuck, Ryker, Grayford, Caneyville, and Haggatt soils. The moderately well drained Deputy soils have the lower parts of their solums formed in black shale residuum. The well drained Ryker and Grayford and the moderately well drained Muscatatuck soils have the middle part of their subsoil formed in loamy glacial drift and are on higher lying summits, shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains. The moderately deep, fine textured Caneyville and the deep, fine textured Haggatt soils are on lower lying backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is low or moderate. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of the soil is used for growing crops and pasture. The native vegetation is mixed hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This soil is of small extent in MLRA 114A.
