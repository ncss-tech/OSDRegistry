ZOOK SERIES

The Zook series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium.

Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.

Where drained, most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. The native vegetation is big bluestem, western wheatgrass, sedges, blue grama and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness.
