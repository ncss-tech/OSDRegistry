7/2016--This official series description has been updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11. The competing series section was updated to reflect taxonomic changes in other series. Further investigation is recommended to determine whether the series spans both the mesic and frigid soil temperature regimes and to verify the lack of volcanic ash influence.
