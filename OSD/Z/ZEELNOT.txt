ZEELNOT SERIES

The Zeelnot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone.  Zeelnot soils are on foothills and mountains.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Xeric Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zeelnot gravelly loam--on a 28 percent north by northwest-facing slope at 7,900 feet elevation in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on August 14, 1984 the soil was dry to 3 inches and moist below this depth.)

(6 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bkq4--32 to 56 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) extremely cobbly silty clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist, strong fine angular blocky structure; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; 25 percent pebbles, 50 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate and silica coatings and pendants 2 to 5 mm thick on all sides of coarse fragments; soft secondary carbonates as threads between peds occupy 20 percent by volume; violently effervescent (45 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 24 inches thick)

    2Bkq5--56 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6) moist, strong fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent pebbles, 65 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate and silica coatings and pendants 2 to 5 mm thick on all sides of coarse fragments; soft secondary carbonates as threads between peds occupy 20 percent by volume; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fritz(T), Gepton(T), Hanson, Hardol(T), Pahreah, Skaggs, Skibo, and the Zeale series.  Fritz soils have 12 to 22 percent clay in the control section and average summer soil temperatures of 52 to 58 degrees F.  Gepton soils have 11 to 18 percent clay in the control section and have cambic horizons. Hanson soils have mollic epipedons greater than 12 inches thick. Hardol soils have 8 to 18 percent clay and moderately rapid permeabiltiy.  Pahreah soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Skaggs soils are moderately deep to bedrock and receive more precipitation than Zeelnot soils.  Skibo soils have an O horizon and 18 to 25 percent clay in the control section.  Zeale soils have moderate permeability and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 50 to 80 percent. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zeelnot soils are on mountains and foothills.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Elevation is 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches; average annual temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 40 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adek, Gany, Meegernot, Nitchly, Skibo, and Zeale soils.  Adek soils are on ridges, mountain sideslopes and summits and have ochric epipedons.  Nitchly soils are on mountains and have ochric epipedons.  Gany, Meegernot, and Skibo soils are on mountains and have mixed minerology.  Zeale soils are on mountains, foothills, and fan terraces, have moderate permeability, and have less than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.
