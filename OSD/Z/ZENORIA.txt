ZENORIA SERIES

The Zenoria series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils. They formed in loamy alluvium mantled by a thin layer of more recent clayey sediments. These soils are on low stream terraces of late Pleistocene or early Holocene age. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Aeric Endoaquults

TYPICAL PEDON: Zenoria clay loam, on a 0.5 percent, slightly convex slope in a hardwood forest, subject to occasional flooding. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Augusta, Bertie, and Yemassee series in closely related families. All of these soils have a semiactive activity class, and none has a clayey surface mantle. In addition, Augusta and Bertie soils have mixed mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zenoria soils are on low terraces along major streams draining the uplands of the Western Coastal Plains. They formed in loamy alluvium mantled by a thin layer of more recent clayey sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 59 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bienville, Cahaba, Guyton, and Una soils. The Bienville and Cahaba soils are on higher positions and are better drained. Guyton soils are on lower positions and have a fine-silty control section. Una soils are on lower positions and have a fine textured control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Runoff is medium on slopes up to 1 percent, and high on slopes more than 1 percent. Permeability is slow. The soil is wet in all layers below a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 feet for long periods during December through April in normal years. Flooding is occasional or frequent during December through June.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Zenoria soils are in hardwood forest. A few areas are used for pasture. The major tree species are willow oak, water oak, sweetgum, Nuttall oak, green ash, and baldcypress.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Coastal Plain (MLRA 133B) of Louisiana and possibly in Mississippi, Arkansas, and eastern Texas. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: LaSalle Parish, Louisiana, l986.  The series was reclassified from an Alfisol to an Ultisol as indicated by lab data on the type location pedon in April, 2000.

REMARKS: A few chipped stone artifacts are present in the Btg/Eb horizon in the type location pedon.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon ----------- 0 to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).
Glossic horizon ---------- 10 to 19 inches (2Btg/Eb horizon).
Argillic horizon --------- 10 to 52 inches (Btg/Eb and 2Btgb horizons horizons).
Lithologic discontinuity - 10 inches (top of the 2Btg/Eb horizon)
Aquic conditions --------- 10 to 19 inches (2Btg/Eb horizon)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory analyses were run on samples from the type location pedon by the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station (S85LA-059-006).
