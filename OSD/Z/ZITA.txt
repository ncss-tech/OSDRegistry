ZITA SERIES

The Zita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Zita soils are on nearly level and very gently sloping plains with a slope range of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:Zita loam, on a nearly level, slightly concave, 0.5 percent slope in cultivated field at an elevation of about 1,044 m (3,425 ft) (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 180 but less than 220 days, cumulative, in normal years. October through March are the driest months.
These soils are intermittently moist in April through September.
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F)
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate: 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 in)
Depth to calcic horizon: 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in)
Solum thickness: more than 203 cm (80 in).
Particle-size control section: 18 to 35 percent silicate clay.

COMPETING SERIES:
This is the Paloduro series in the same family. Similar are the Estacado, Pep, Portales, and Tokio series.
Paloduro soils: have a calcic horizon at depths over 102 cm (40 in) and formed in sediments derived from the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.
Estacado and Tokio soils: have an argillic horizon, in addition Tokio soils have an ochric epipedon.
Pep and Portales soils: have slight to violent effervescence in all horizons above the calcic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: calcareous, loamy eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.
Landform: nearly level and very gently sloping, slightly concave swales on eolian plains.
Slopes: 0 to 3 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 432 to 533 mm (17 to 21 in)
Frost-free period: 185 to 220 days.
Elevation: 823 to 1,433 m (2,700 to 4,700 ft)
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 25 to 36

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Portales series and the Acuff, Amarillo, Olton, and Pullman series.
Acuff soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have an argillic horizon.
Amarillo soils are on higher landscape positions, have an argillic horizon, and do not have a mollic epipedon.
Olton and Pullman soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have an argillic horizon that contains more than 35 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.
Portales soils are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderate permeability. Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly cultivated to cotton, grain sorghum, and wheat.
Climax vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama,
sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairieclover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern part (MLRA 77C in LRR H) of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Potter County, Texas; 1929.

REMARKS: 
Series revised MLRA-77 Soil Survey; Deaf Smith County, Texas; 1998. New type location: 07NM041002.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in) (A horizons)
Cambic horizon: 46 to 61 cm (18 to 24 in) (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon: 61 to 89 cm (24 to 35 in) (Bk horizon)
Carbonate plugged horizon (kk): 61 to 203 cm (24 to 80 in) (Bkk horizons)
Note: The kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.
