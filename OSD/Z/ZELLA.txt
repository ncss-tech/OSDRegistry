USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly cultivated to corn, winter wheat, and grain sorghum.  A considerable acreage is irrigated.  Climax vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few midgrasses and includes blue grama and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover. This soil has been correlated to the Hardland (R077AY040OK) and Loamy Upland (R077XY015KS) range site in MLRA-77A.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A in LRR H) of Southwest Kansas and the Oklahoma Panhandle.  The series is of moderate extent.
