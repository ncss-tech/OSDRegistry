ZIMM SERIES

The Zimm series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loamy over clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on flats on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over clayey, mixed over smectitic, superactive, nonacid, frigid Aeric Endoaquepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Zimm loam, on a linear flat of 1 percent on a glacial lake plain, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 400 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

    Ap--0 to 10 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; many very fine and fine roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Eg--10 to 15 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) fine sandy loam; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; moderate very fine to medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; clear broken boundary. (0 to 10 centimeters thick)

    Bw--15 to 66 centimeters; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) stratified sandy loam, silt loam and loamy very fine sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few very fine roots; many medium distinct dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) redoximorphic depletions and many medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderately acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (38 to 76 centimeters thick)

    2Bkg--66 to 99 centimeters; gray (5Y 5/1) clay; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine and medium white (2.5Y 8/1) nodules of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 51 centimeters thick)

    2Cg--99 to 203 centimeters; gray (5Y 5/1) clay; massive; firm; few fine white (2.5Y 8/1) nodules of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--loamy over clayey glaciolacustrine deposits
Landform--flats on glacial lake plains
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Elevation--350 to 490 meters above sea level
Mean annual air temperature--3 to 5 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--635 to 711 millimeters
Frost-free period--95 to 125 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the McDavitt and Aerie soils. These soils formed in the same parent material as the Zimm soils and form a hydrosequence with the Zimm soils.
McDavitt--are in lower landscape positions, in drainageways and depressions
Aerie--are on convex positions on the landscape

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils have a frequently saturated zone occuring as high as 0.15 meter below the surface during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.41 to 141.14 micrometers per second in the loamy mantle and 0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second in the clayey glaciolacustrine deposits

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped for hay. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Physiographic Division--Interior Plains or Laurentian Upland
Physiographic Province--Central Lowland Province or Superior Upland
MLRA--Northern Minnesota Glacial Lake Basins (88)
LRR--K; northern Minnesota
Extent--small
