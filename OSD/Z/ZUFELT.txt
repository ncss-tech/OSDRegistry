ZUFELT SERIES

The Zufelt series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Zufelt soils are on valley floors, fan remnants, and low stream terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous Calcic Cryaquolls

REMARKS: The calcareous class was added to the classification of this soil in 2007.
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from a depth of 0 to 36 cm
Calcic horizon: from a depth of 36 to 84 cm
