ZEEBAR SERIES

The Zeebar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from quartzite, basalt, and tuff.  They are on mountain slopes, hills, ridges and fan remnants and have slopes of 4 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Zeebar gravelly loam - on a northeast facing mountain slope of 22 percent on rangeland at 2,515 meters elevation. When described on June 26, 1985, the soil was slightly moist throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

       A--0 to 20 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 33 cm thick) 

       Bt1--20 to 36 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.

       Bt2--36 to 56 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.7); gradual wavy boundary.

       Bt3--56 to 89 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 25 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.9); gradual wavy boundary.

       Bt4--89 to 124 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint and few distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 89 to 127 cm.)

      C--124 to 152 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) extremely cobbly sandy clay loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).
