COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zozobra soils are on shoulders of eroded fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist; and from Quaternary loess.  Slopes are 5 to 12 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jaconita, Khapo, and Panky soils.  Jaconita soils are sandy-skeletal, contain less calcium carbonate, and occur on footslopes and backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Khapo soils are coarse-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants. Panky soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on summits of eroded fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid to very rapid permeability in the underlying sandy material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Zozobra soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, sideoats grama, black grama, galleta, New Mexico feathergrass, twoneedle pinyon, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Gravelly(R036XB114NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Zozobra soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
