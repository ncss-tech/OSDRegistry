ZEPHYRCOVE SERIES


The Zephyrcove series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from trachyte. The Zephyrcove soils are on sideslopes and ridgetops on mountains. Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Ultic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Zephyrcove stony sandy loam on a southeast facing (139 degree), 27 percent slope at an elevation of 2198 meters. When described on 07/12/2004 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Clarkslodge soils.  Clarkslodge soils are greater than 150 cm deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Zephyrcove soils are on sideslopes and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from trachyte.  Elevation is 1925 to 2310 meters. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 580 to 740 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 4.5 to 7 degrees C. The frost free season is 40 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Southcamp and Genoapeak soils. The Southcamp soils are deeper than 100 cm to bedrock and typically on more northerly aspects.  The Genoapeak soils are less than 50 cm to bedrock and are typically in more convex positions on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate permeability above the bedrock, high runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation and wildlife. Vegetation is white fir and Greenleaf manzanita.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This soil is of minor extent in Nevada in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains
