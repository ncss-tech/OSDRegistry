ZEEGEE SERIES

The Zeegee series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Zeegee soils are on stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zeegee silty clay -- on a 0 percent slope at 3,900 feet elevation in pasture.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on July 10, 1990, the soil was moist to 28 inches and a water table was present at 28 inches).

    Oi--0 to 3 inches; slightly decomposed roots. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    Ag--3 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strong coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common medium and coarse roots; common fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 18 inches thick)

    Bg1--14 to 19 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; common medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) redox depletions; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bg2--19 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; many coarse distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) redox depletions; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 17 inches thick)

    Bg3--30 to 38 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; many fine distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) redox concentrations; weak very coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear   smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

    2Cg--38 to 63 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; many fine distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) redox depletions; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine pores; 55 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0)

TYPE LOCATION:  Lemhi County, Idaho; about 1 mile north of Salmon, Idaho, about 1,600 feet west and 500 feet south of the northeast corner of section 31, T.22N., R.22E.  Latitude - 45 degrees, 12 minutes, 4 seconds North; Longitude - 114 degrees, 54 minutes, 1 second West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Average annual soil temperature - 40 to 42 degrees F.
Control section average - Percent clay: 20 to 34
Depth to high water table - 6 to 18 inches (March to July) 
Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 18 inches
Depth to discontinuity - 35 to 45 inches

Ag horizon
Value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 1 through 3 dry or moist
Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline

Bg horizons
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value - 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma - 1 through 3, dry or moist
Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline
Texture - SICL, CL, SIL

2Cg horizon 
Hue - 2.5Y or 10YR
Chroma - 1 to 3 dry or moist
Reaction - slightly or moderately alkaline
Texture - GRX-SIL, GRX-VFSL
Rock fragments - 60 to 85 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bohnly, Perella, and Wabanica series.  Bohnly soils lack the extremely gravelly discontinuity at 34 to 45 inches.  Perella soils lack rock fragments and have carbonates at 16 to 36 inches.  Wabanica soils lack rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zeegee soils are on stream terraces.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation is 3,700 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ajax, Bursteadt, Cowbone, Smout, and Tohobit soils.  Ajax soils are on valley flats and have fine, smectitic particle-size control sections.  Bursteadt soils are on valley flats, are moderately well drained and have a calcic horizon.  Cowbone soils are on valley flats, have a calcic horizon and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections.  Smout soils are on valley flats, are moderately well drained and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Tohobit soils are on valley flats, have a calcic horizon and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Slow runoff.  Moderately slow permeability.  This soil is occasionally flooded for brief periods from April to June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated under irrigation for hay and pasture.  The native vegetation is sedges, rushes, tufted hairgrass and willows.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lemhi County, Idaho, 1999.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 3 to 14 inches. (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - the zone from 14 to 38 inches (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons)

Particle-size control section - the zone from 13 to 43 inches (part of the A, the Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 and part of the 2Cg horizons)

All depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.
