ZINEB SERIES

The Zineb series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Zineb soils are on inset fans, fan aprons and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zineb gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine vesicular and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 15 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bw--15 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 23 cm thick)

    Bq--33 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent, 5 to 25 mm strong durinodes; 25 percent discontinuous weak silica cementation; 50 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 20 cm thick)

    2Bk1--48 to 69 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent cobbles and 35 percent gravel, strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (18 to 30 cm thick)

        2Bk2--69 to 173 cm; variegated extremely cobbly coarse sand; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; thin silica laminae on a few gravel; moderately thick carbonate coatings on underside of a few gravel; few very weakly cemented, 1 to 5 mm thick horizontal seams of carbonate; 40 percent cobbles and 45 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about 4 miles south and 10 miles east of Crescent Valley, 1,500 feet west and 100 feet north of the approximate southeast corner of section 24, T. 29 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Hand-me-down Creek 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 21 minutes 39 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 23 minutes 31 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.3608333 latitude, -116.3919444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in the winter and spring, dry June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.

Depth to Bq horizon: 25 to 46 cm.
Other features: Some pedons have unconformable loam textured subhorizons below 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 5 to 15 percent
Rock fragments:  Average 50 to 75 percent, gravel dominant in upper portion, and cobbles in lower portion.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry; when mixed the upper 18 cm have a dry value greater than 5.5.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Bw horizon
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or is massive.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent, dominantly gravel.
Texture:  Gravelly loam or gravelly very fine sandy loam.

Bq horizon
Texture:  Very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent, dominantly gravel.
Silica cementation:  Discontinuous weak silica cementation and/or durinodes in a friable matrix.

2Bk or 2Bqk horizon
Texture:  Extremely cobbly sandy loam in the upper part and extremely cobbly loamy coarse sand or extremely cobbly coarse sand in the lower part.
Rock fragments:  60 to 85 percent, dominantly cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Catlow, Mina and Porrone series.  

Catlow soils have a horizon that is firm and brittle within 38 to 76 cm. Mina and Porrone soils have a particle-size control section with 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zineb soils are on inset fans, fan aprons and fan skirts.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a small component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,435 to 1,985 meters. The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Enko, Izzen, McConnel and Tomera series.  Enko soils have a loamy textured particle-size control section with less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Izzen soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the substratum.  McConnel soils lack silica accumulations. Tomera soils have a clay Bt horizon that is sodium affected.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, gray horsebrush, mustards, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are
 not extensive. MLRA 28B.
