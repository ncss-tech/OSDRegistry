ZALCO SERIES

The Zalco series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium of Holocene age. These nearly level soils are on natural levees of streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Typic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Zalco fine sand, on north-facing, convex, 0.7 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 15.2 m (50 ft) (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

     A--0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose, very friable; common fine roots; common fine pores; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 38 cm [3 to 15 in] thick)

     C1--10 to 48 cm (4 to 19 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose, very friable; many thin strata of fine sandy loam; few fine roots; few fine pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

     C2--48 to 69 cm (19 to 27 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; loose, very friable; many thin strata of fine sandy loam; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

     C3--69 to 94 cm (27 to 37 in); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; massive; loose; very friable; few thin strata of loam and fine sandy loam; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

     C4--94 to 124 cm (37 to 49 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; massive; loose, very friable; very friable; many thin strata of loamy fine sand; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

     C5--124 to 203 cm (49 to 80 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.  (Combined thickness of C horizons is 140 to 196 cm [55 to 77 in])

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Chicolete, Meguin, Navidad, and Sinton series.  

Chicloete, Meguin, Navidad, and Sinton soils:  mollic epipedons; in addition, Chicolete, Meguin and Sinton have more than 18 percent clay in the control section; on crevasse splay landform.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained.  Permeability is rapid.  Runoff is negligible.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rangeland.  Some occasionally flooded areas are in improved bermudagrass pastures.  Native vegetation includes switchgrass, little bluestem, purpletop triden, and Virginia wildrye.  A few hackberry, cottonwood and live oak trees are in some areas.  (Ecological site name: Sandy Bottomland 35-42" Pz; Ecological site number: R150AY541TX)

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The soil is mainly along small streams in coastal areas of south Texas; MLRA 150A; LRR-T.  It is of moderate extent.
