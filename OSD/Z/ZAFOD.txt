ZAFOD SERIES

The Zafod series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz monzonite, granite, and some limestone. Zafod soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Xereptic Haplodurids

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zafod soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from quartz monzonite, granite, and some limestone. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,495 to 2,230 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eastwell, Gremmers, and Ungene soils. Eastwell soils are shallow to duripans. Gremmers soils are loamy and shallow to duripans. Ungene soils are sandy-skeletal, very deep, and do not have duripans. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Zafod soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and winterfat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRAs 28A and 28B.
