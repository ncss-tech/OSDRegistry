SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1996 

REMARKS: Zekiah soils were previously mapped as Bibb soils and Mixed Alluvial land. 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 cm (A horizon)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 8 cm to a depth of 200 cm is periodically saturated (endosaturation) 

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm 

The 2007 revision updates the format, the range in characteristics for the Cg, Ab, and Cg horizons and introduces metric units.
