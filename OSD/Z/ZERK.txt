ZERK SERIES

The Zerk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Zerk soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, inset fans, beach plains, barrier beaches, and spits.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Candelaria series.  Candelaria soils have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C. and are moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zerk soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, inset fans, beach plains, barrier beaches, and spits.  These soils formed mainly in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Wave-modified fan alluvium forms a portion of the parent material where this series occurs on lacustrine landforms.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 1,950 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cren and Linoyer soils.  Cren soils are coarse-silty and have horizons with more than 20 percent durinodes.  Linoyer soils are coarse-silty and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons or features.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very low or low surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Zerk soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, winterfat, Douglas rabbitbrush, and globemallow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28B.
