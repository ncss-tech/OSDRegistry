KIEV SERIES

The Kiev series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants and foothills. Slopes are 0 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kiev loam in native grass (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure in the upper part grading to moderate medium granular in the lower part; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

    Bw--5 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; disseminated lime, slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of A and Bw horizons is 7 to 18 inches.)

    Bk1--14 to 28 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; common fine masses of lime; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 40 inches thick)

    Bk2--28 to 60 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine pores; violently effervescent; common medium masses of lime; strongly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.
