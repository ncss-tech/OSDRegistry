KESWICK SERIES

The Keswick series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 25 to 50 centimeters of loess or loamy sediments and in the underlying paleosol weathered from glacial till. These soils are on convex summits of interfluves, convex side slopes, shoulders of side slopes on till plains. Slope ranges from 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iowa County, Iowa, 1961

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 28 to 78 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters (A, E1, E2, 2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 28 centimeters (A, E1, and E2 horizons);
albic horizon-- the zone from a depth of 8 to 18 centimeters (E1 horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 109 centimeters (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Where more permeable soils formed in loess are upslope, Keswick soils commonly have seepy spots in wet seasons, but in years of average rainfall this is not a hazard to use of the soil.

The color and pattern appear to be inherited from the Late Sangamon paleosol.

Aquertic subgroup based on redoximorphic depletions within the upper 25 centimeters of the argillic horizon and linear extensibility greater than 6.0 centimeters between the surface and a depth of 100 centimeters.

Chromic subgroup based on color value, moist, of 4 or more and color value, dry, of 6 or more after mixing the surface materials to a depth of 18 centimeters.
