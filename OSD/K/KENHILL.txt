KENHILL SERIES

The Kenhill series consists of soils that are moderately deep, well drained, and moderately permeable above a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits in the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Kenhill soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

Blakeney and Kimbrough soils: have mixed mineralogy and do not have argillic horizons.
Friona soils: are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods.
Pojo soils: have less organic matter in the surface horizon and higher values and chromas and have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.
Spraberry soils: have a petrocalcic horizon less than 50 cm (20in) deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This includes the similar Kimbrough series.
Kimbrough soils: are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately permeable above and below the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. Surface runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for rangeland. Small areas are used for irrigated cropland. Principal crops where irrigated are grain sorghum and wheat. Climax vegetation is dominantly short grasses with a few mid grasses and includes blue grama, black grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, galleta, or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover. This soil has been correlated to the Loamy (R077DY042TX) ecological site in MLRA-77D.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains of eastern New Mexico (MLRA-77D). The series is of minor extent.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Friona series. Although color indicates a mollic epipedon to a depth of 52 cm (20 in), lab data suggests that organic carbon percent only allows for 33 cm (13 in) of mollic epipedon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to13 in) A, Bt1 horizons.
Argillic horizon: 15 to 72 cm (6 to 28 in) Bt horizons.
Petrocalcic horizon: 72 to 110 cm (28 to 43 in) Bkkm horizon.
Calcic horizon: 110 to 203 cm (43 to 80 in) Bkk horizons.
