KRIEST SERIES

The Kriest series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain and foothill slopes and ridges.  They formed in glacial till and residuum with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess in the surface layers.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Dystroxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kriest gravelly ashy sandy loam, woodland; on a southwest-facing slope of 60 percent at 3,100 feet elevation.  When described on August 21, 1972, the soil was dry.  Pedon was redescribed on June 30, 1999. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 1.5 inches; needles, leaves, and twigs.  (1 to 1.5 inches thick)

    Bt1--18 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; common faint clay films lining pores and on some surfaces of peds; few 1/16 to 1/4 inch dark yellowish brown lamellae; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--27 to 34 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; many fine pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; many 1/16 to 1/4 inch dark brown lamellae; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    BC--34 to 43 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine pores; many 1/16 to 1/4 dark brown bands; 30 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    2Cr--43 inches; weathered granitic bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kriest soils are on mountains and foothills.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in glacial till and residuum derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess in the surface.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.   The average frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dufort, Idamont, Pend Oreille and Treble soils. Dufort soils are on mountains and foothills and are ashy over loamy-skeletal. Idamont and Pend Oreille soils are on mountain slopes and are ashy over loamy.  Treble soils are on mountain slopes and are loamy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability above the paralithic contact.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Woodland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, western white pine, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, western larch, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of myrtle pachystima, baldhip rose, Oregon fairybells, western meadowrue, creambush oceanspray; mallow ninebark, pine reedgrass, Saskatoon serviceberry, common snowberry, white spirea, and low Oregon grape.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, California, and possibly northwestern Montana, and northeastern Washington.  The series is not extensive.
