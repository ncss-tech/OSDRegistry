KLACKING SERIES

The Klacking series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy deposits on outwash plains, kames, kame moraines, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Arenic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Klacking sand, on a 13 percent slope in a wooded area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A--0 to 5 cm (0 to 2 inches); black (10YR 2/1) sand; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and common medium roots; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [3 to 10 cm (1 to 2 inches) thick]

 Bw1--5 to 31 cm (2 to 12 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium and common coarse roots; about 7 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--31 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and common medium roots; about 9 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.	

 Bw3--61 to 86 cm (24 to 34 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common medium and few fine roots; about 11 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 38 to 81 cm (15 to 32 inches).]

 E and Bt--86 to 112 cm (34 to 44 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand (E) and lamellae of strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) loamy sand (Bt); weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine and medium roots; about 9 percent gravel; slightly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [18 to 76 cm (7 to 30 inches) thick]

 B/E--112 to 203 cm (44 to 80 inches); 60 percent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy loam (Bt) surrounded by light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand (E); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; about 6 percent gravel; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Ogemaw County, Michigan; about 3 miles north of Lupton; 2,400 feet north and 1,500 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 7, T. 24 N., R. 4 E., Goodar Township; USGS South Branch topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 29 minutes 12 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 00 minutes 03 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Klacking soils are on outwash plains, kames, kame moraines, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The Klacking soils formed in sandy and loamy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 cm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat excessively drained Graycalm soils, the excessively drained Rubicon soils, and the Montcalm soils on similar landscape positions. The Montcalm soils have a spodic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or moderately high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested, including tree plantations. Some areas are idle cropland or in permanent pasture. A small proportion is used for small grains and hay crops. The native vegetation is dominantly northern red oak, red maple, and big tooth aspen with some jack pine and white pine. Ground cover consists of blueberry, bracken fern, witch hazel, and wintergreen. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 94C, and 98 in the northern part of lower Michigan. This series is of large extent.
