KIPPERS SERIES

The Kippers series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum fine-grained sandstone, limestone, and chert.  Kippers soils are on summits and sideslopes of hills and ridges on plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aquic Paleustalfs

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; on the Kaibab Plateau, Grand Canyon National Park, 36 degrees 13 minutes 25 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees 57 minutes 54 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  soil moisture control section, in normal years is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice. Udic ustic moisture regime

Mean annual soil temperature - 38 to 47 degrees F

Depth to bedrock - 40 to 60 inches

Depth to argillic - 5 to 14 inches

Depth to redoximorphic features - 12 to 29 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average) - Clay content: 40 to 55 percent 

A horizons 
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 2.5 to 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral
When colors are dark enough, the A horizon does not meet thickness criteria for a mollic epipedon.

Bt horizons
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR
Value:  3 to 6 dry or moist
Chroma: 4 to 8, dry or moist

Reaction: very strongly acid to slightly acid
Redoximorphic features: few to many, fine to coarse, faint to prominent mottles; few to many, fine to coarse, faint to distinct depletion zones with a chroma of 2 or less.
Other features: Some argillic horizons may lack slickensides.

Some pedons have E horizons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum, fine-grained sandstone, limestone, and chert
Landform: summits and sideslopes of hills and ridges on plateaus
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent
Elevation: 7900 to 9750 feet
Mean annual temperature: 36 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 25 to 33 inches
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months: December through April
Driest months: May, June, October, and November
Frost-free period: 70 to 105 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kanabownits and Kaiparowits soils. Kanabownits soils are skeletal and do not have an argillic horizon.  Kaiparowits soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, medium to very high runoff, very slow permeability, saturated with water between 12 and 40 inches (Btss horizons) for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in March and April due to snow melt.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, timber production and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes White fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, Quaking aspen, and Ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kaibab Plateau above 8000 feet in north central Arizona; MLRA 35.  The series is of moderate extent.
