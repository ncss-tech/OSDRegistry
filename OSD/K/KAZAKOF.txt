DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high to very high in the C horizon, moderately high to high in the 2A, 2Bhs, and 2Bw horizons.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
On slopes of less than 45 percent, the soils are used as rangeland.  The native vegetation is tall grass, dominantly bluejoint reedgrass, and associated plants including fireweed, salmonberry, and alder.  A few patches of white spruce, Sitka spruce, and paper birch occur in places.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 225 Southern Alaska Peninsula Mountains. 
Extent: extensive.
