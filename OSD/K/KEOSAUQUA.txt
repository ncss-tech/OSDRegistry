KEOSAUQUA SERIES

The Keosauqua series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loamy alluvium and the underlying sandy alluvium.  These soils occur on slightly convex slopes on low and very low stream terraces in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Van Buren County, Iowa, 1995.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 33 to 83 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (Ap and A horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 33 to 127 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Several property ranges of the Keosauqua and Cresent series overlap. Further study is needed to clearly differentiate these two series.

Cation exchange activity class is supported by lab sample number S92IA-177-002.
