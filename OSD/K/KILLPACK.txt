KILLPACK SERIES

The Killpack series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or alluvium over residuum derived from shale. Killpack soils are on hills, pediments and strath terraces. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 178 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Killpack clay loam in cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 23 cm; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (9 to 18 cm thick)

    Bw--23 to 58 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky parting to weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 53 cm thick)

    BCy--58 to 74 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; many coarse gypsum crystals; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 25 cm thick)

    Cr--74 to 152 cm; light brownish gray weathered shale.
