USE AND VEGETATION:  Kevin soils are used mainly for nonirrigated cropland and the more strongly rolling morainic areas are used for range.  Potential native vegetation is western wheatgrass, needleandthread, green needlegrass, clubmoss, and fringed sagewort. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kevin soils are extensive on the glaciated plains of northern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Blaine County, Montana, 1969. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0105, MT0690.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches (mixed)(Ap, part of Bt horizons); argillic horizon - from 6 to 9 inches (Bt horizon); horizons of carbonate accumulation - (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons); particle-size control section - from 6 to 40 inches (Bt, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons).  Kevin soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
