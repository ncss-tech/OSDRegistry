COMPETING SERIES: This are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: gravelly colluvium derived from marble
Elevation: 545 to 712 feet
Slope: 6 to 25 percent
Annual precipitation: about 22 inches
Annual temperature: about 25 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Tigahaha and Tuksuk soils. Tigahaha soils are well drained, moderately deep, and occur on mountains. Tuksuk soils are very poorly drained, moderately deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the above the bedrock and very low in the bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is dwarf herbaceous vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hill-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
