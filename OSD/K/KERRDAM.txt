KERRDAM SERIES

The Kerrdam series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed silty, lacustrine, and eolian deposits.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, lake plains and terraces, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, frigid Calcic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kerrdam silt loam, in croplands (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 12 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 17 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 16 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak very coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; disseminated lime and common medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick)

    C1--16 to 34 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

    C2--34 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)

SAR:  13 to 20
Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4

COMPETING SERIES:

Dryfork (MT) - have SAR of 13 to 40 in the Bw and Bk horizons.

Watercanyon (ID) - are mainly calcareous in the A and Bw horizons; do not have an SAR of 13 or greater above a depth of 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - stream terraces, lake plains and terraces and dissected alluvial fans.
Elevation - 2,500 to 3,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 30 percent.
Parent material - mixed silty, lacustrine, and eolian deposits.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist falls and springs; warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls as snow or rain in late fall, winter, and in spring.
Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 105 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as irrigated alfalfa-grass hayland, crested wheatgrass, improved pastureland, and rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kerrdam soils are of small extent in intermountain valleys of western Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Lake County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Lake County, Montana, 1982.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0729 and MT1023.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a dark colored surface horizon from 0 to 5 inches, that when mixed to 7 inches is ochric (Ap horizon); a cambic horizon from 5 to 12 inches (Bw horizon); an accumulation of lime from 12 to 16 inches (Bk horizon).  A particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk, C1, C2 horizons).  The Kerrdam soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.
