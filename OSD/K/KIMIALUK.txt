GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kunjik, Kanik, and Continentaldivide soils.
Kunjik soils have a strongly contrasting particle size class to fragmental, a cryic soil temperature regime, and occur on ridges of mountains.
Kanik soils do not have a cambic horizon, have a high local runoff class, and occur on similar landforms on backslopes.
Continentaldivide soils have a mollic epipedon, lithic contact at depths between 45 to 70 cm (18 to 28 in), and occur on ridges of mountains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: well drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: very high in the Oe horizon; moderately high to high in the Ajj, C, and Ck horizons; and moderately high in the Cjj horizon
Permeability: very rapid in the Oe horizon, moderate to rapid in the Ajj horizon, moderate in the Cjj horizon, and moderate to moderately rapid in the C and Ck horizons
Runoff: low to medium

USE AND VEGETATION:
Use: wildlife habitat, recreation, and subsistence
Native vegetation: marsh Labrador tea, dwarf birch, black crowberry, Flavocetraria culcullata, reindeer lichen, Bigelow's sedge, island cetraria lichen, star reindeer lichen, shortstalk sedge, bog blueberry, arctic willow, tealeaf willow, alpine azalea, lingonberry, Flavocetraria nivalis, grayleaf willow, smallawned sedge, and eightpetal mountain-avens.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands. The series is of small extent.
