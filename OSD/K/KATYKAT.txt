KATYKAT SERIES

The Katykat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and mudstone. The Katykat soils are on foothills and mountain slopes, and summits. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bigridge, Hospiter, Hotaw, Millerridge, Minniecreek, Pasturerock, Sitton, Speaker and Willakenzie series.  Bigridge soils contain a paralithic contact between 102 to 152 cm.  Hospiter soils are not dry for more than 90 days.  Hotaw, Millerridge, Minniecreek, Speaker and Willakenzie soils contain a paralithic contact between 51 to 102 cm.  Pasturerock and Sitton soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Pasturerock soils have a mollic epipedon and Sitton soils are not found in MLRA 15 and have a mean annual air temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Katykat soils are on side slopes and summits of mountains and foothills. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone and mudstone of the Franciscan Formation. Elevation is 300 to 900 meters. The climate is subhumid, mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1016 to 1500 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 200 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Almaden, and Sanikara soils. Almaden soils are very deep and have mollic epipedons thicker than 50 centimeters.  Sanikara soils are shallow to a lithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately permeable medium to very rapid runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for watershed, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is California live oak, bay laurel, buckeye, poison oak and annual grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Part of the Coastal Range of California, Major Land Resource Area 15 -- Central California Coast Range. The Katykat soils are of moderate extent.
