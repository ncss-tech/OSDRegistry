KASKI SERIES

The Kaski series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 66 centimeters (26 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kaski loam - in a cultivated field. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 48 centimeters (0 to 19 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

	A--48 to 66 centimeters (19 to 26 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon ranges from 15 to 36 inches.) 

	AC--66 to 102 centimeters (26 to 40 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and coarse granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

	C--102 to 200 centimeters (40 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Harper County, Kansas; about 13 kilometers (8 miles) north and 5 1/2 kilometers (3 1/2 miles) west of Attica, Kansas; located about 182 meters (600 feet) west and 61 meters (200 feet) south of the northeast corner, sec. 16, T. 31 S., R. 9 W; Zenda SE USGS quad.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture regime:  ustic moisture regime bordering on udic 
Soil temperature regime:  mesic
Mean annual soil temperature:  13 to 14 degrees C (55 to 58 degrees F)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches)
Particle-size control section: 18 to 35 percent clay
Depth to free calcium carbonate:  sometimes occur below 40 centimeters (15 inches)

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR
Value :  3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  1 to 3
Texture:  loam 
Reaction:  moderately acid to neutral

AC horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  3 to 6, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma:  1 to 3
texture:  sandy loam, loam, or clay loam
Reaction:  moderately acid to slightly alkaline
Note:  Some pedons have a Bw horizon with color, texture, and reaction like the AC horizon

C horizon:  
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  sandy loam, loam, or clay loam
Reaction:  moderately acid to moderately alkaline
Note:  Sandy strata occur below 100 centimeters (40 inches) in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: 
These are the Bon (SD), Frazwell (AZ), Humbarger (KS), Lynx (AZ), Manzano (NM), Mauricanyon (CO), Merrick (NE), Pack (UT), Shanta (NM), St. Onge (SD), and Umbarg (CO) series in the same family.
Bon soils are calcareous at depths of 15 to 50 centimeters (6 to 20 inches) and occur in cooler areas.
Frazwell soils occur in drier areas and have a stone line containing 40 to 55 percent rock fragments.
Humbarger soils have free carbonates above a depth of 40 centimeters (15 inches).
Lynx soils occur in drier areas.
Manzano soils occur in drier areas.
Maskell soils occur in cooler areas.
Mauricanyon soils occur in drier areas
Merrick soils occur in cooler and drier areas along the Platte River in Nebraska.
Pack soils have redoximorphic features at depths less than 100 centimeters (40 inches).
Shanta soils average 5 to 20 percent rock fragments in the control section and occur in drier areas.
St. Onge soils are calcareous above a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches) and occur in cooler areas.
Umbarg soils are calcareous throughout and occur in drier areas.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material:  loamy alluvium
Landform:  flood plains of river valleys
Slopes:  0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature:  13 to 14 degrees C (55 to 58 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  55 to 80 centimeters (22 to 32 inches)
Thornthwaite Annual PE Index:  36 to 54

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Farnum, Shellabarger, Waldeck and Zenda soils.
The Farnum and Shellabarger soils are on adjacent uplands and have an argillic horizon.
The Zenda and Waldeck soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a water table above 100 centimeters (40 inches) for part of the year and are on slightly lower positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Well drained.  Runoff is low.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Permeability is moderate.  Soils are rarely or occasionally flooded. Water table is generally below 180 centimeters (6 feet) except during periods of high stream flow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cultivated to wheat and sorghums. Native vegetation 
is tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Kansas; LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, primarily MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains; The series is moderately extensive.
