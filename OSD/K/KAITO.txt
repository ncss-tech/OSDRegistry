KAITO SERIES

The Kaito series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.  Kaito soils are on alluvial fans of hills.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Kaito extremely gravelly fine sandy loam - on an alluvial fan sloping 49 percent to the west at 5,810 feet elevation -- rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described, the soil was dry throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bluechief (UT), Boreham (UT), Hiko Springs (UT), Kinan (AZ), McCutchen (NV), Moffat (UT), Nakai (UT), Nakoy (UT), Nolava (UT), Nuahs (NV), Pagina (AZ), Riemod (UT), Teabrush(T)(UT), and Trook (WY) series. Bluechief and Pagina soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Boreham, Hiko Springs, Kinan, McCutchen, Moffat, Nakai, Nakoy, Nolava, Nuahs, Riemod, Teabrush, and Trook soils are very deep. In addition, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, & 29) and have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kaito soils are on alluvial fans of hills.  They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aneth, Claysprings, Piute, Sheppard, and Tohatin soils.  Aneth soils are sandy, contain buried loamy horizons, and occur on adjacent eolian-mantled surfaces.  Claysprings soils are shallow and occur on adjacent backslopes of hills.   Piute soils are very shallow and occur on structural benches.  Sheppard soils are sandy and occur on stable dunes.  Tohatin soils are sandy, contain less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and occur on dissected fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Kaito soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is blackbrush, Indian ricegrass, galleta, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Torrey Mormon tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kaito soils are of small extent on the Blanding Basin portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shiprock Area, Parts of San Juan County, New Mexico and Apache County, Arizona; 1993.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Calcic horizon - the zone from 3 to 47 inches (Bk1, Bk2, 2Bk3, 2BCk horizons)

Paralithic contact - the boundary at 47 inches (2Cr horizon)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy, Ninth Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The control section of the typifying pedon was wet sieved to determine percent of size fraction larger than very fine sand. The weighted average of the pedon was over 30 percent coarser than very fine sand.
