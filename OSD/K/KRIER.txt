KRIER SERIES

The Krier series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium over sandy alluvium of Holocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on floodplains and sloughs.  Slope range is 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 13.9 degrees C (57 degrees F).
