KATPA SERIES

The Katpa series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain sideslopes. These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone and loess. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Katpa soils have moderate permeability. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature isabout 37 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic Calcic Pachic Haplocryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Katpa gravelly silt loam, on a 46 percent slope with south aspect at 8480 feet elevation, in an area of subalpine fir/western meadowrue h.t., open canopy woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Oi--0 to 0.5 inch; discontinuous forest litter of nondecomposed and decomposed needles and leaves; abrupt broken boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    A1--0.5 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse granular structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent pebbles, trace cobbles and stones; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick) 

    A2--2 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 25 percent pebbles, trace cobbles and stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick) 

    A3--7 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; 40 percent pebbles, trace cobbles and stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bk1--16 to 32 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, few fine and common medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; common hard pendants of carbonates and many coats of soft powdery lime on underside of cobbles and coarse pebbles; slightly effervescent; 45 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles and trace stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8), gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bk2--32 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; many hard pendants of carbonates and many coats of soft powdery lime on underside of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; 30 percent pebbles, 50 percent cobbles and trace stones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
