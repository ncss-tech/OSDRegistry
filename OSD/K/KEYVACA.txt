R horizon: weakly to strongly cemented oolitic limestone bedrock; solution holes up to 100 centimeters or more deep can be filled with sandy and/or loamy material.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Pennekamp series.
Pennekamp soils have more than 45 percent silt, have highly decomposed organic soil material Oa horizons, occur over coral limestone, and occur slightly higher on the landscape

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): low broad flats and low rises on the Islands of Key West
Parent material: loamy residuum from oolithic limestone bedrock
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 27 degrees C (75 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1570 millimeters (37 to 62 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cudjoe, Islamorada, Keylargo, Keywest, Lignumvitae, Matecumbe, and Saddlebunch soils. 
Cudjoe soils: have marly silt loam particle-sized control section, have bedrock at depths greater than 25 centimeters, have water tables at less than 15 centimeters, and occur on slightly lower positions in the tidal zone where they are frequently flooded.
Islamorada and KeyLargo soils: are composed entirely of highly decomposed organic materials over oolitic limestone, the depth to bedrock is greater than 50 centimeters, and occur on similar positions, in addition, Islamorada and KeyLargo are subject to tidal flooding.
Keywest soils: have stratification of marl and muck materials over oolitic limestone, have bedrock at depths greater than 150 centimeters, have water tables of less than 15 centimeters (6 inches), and occur in slightly lower landscape positions.
Lignumvitae soils: have marly silt loam particle-sized control section, have bedrock at depths greater than 50 centimeters, have water tables at less than 15 centimeters (6 inches), and occur on slightly lower landscape positions in the tidal zone where they are frequently flooded.
Matecumbe soils: have highly decomposed organic soil materials, have very shallow depths to bedrock, and with internally free water also very shallow
Saddlebunch soils: have marly silt loam particle-sized control section, have less limestone rock fragments, have water tables at less than 30 centimeters (12 inches), and occur on slightly lower positions in the tidal zone where they are frequently flooded.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Moderately well drained and is always within the limestone bedrock
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Moderately high
Runoff: Medium
Depth to seasonal high-water table: 106 to 203 centimeters (42 to 80 inches) and is always within the limestone bedrock 

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major Uses: wildlife habitat, recreation, and residential housing 
Dominant vegetation: South Florida slash pine, poisonwood, wiregrass, silver palm, locustberry and plumy brake fern, and less commonly, cabbage palm, saw palmetto, satinleaf, pine fern, partridge pea, and waxmyrtle.
