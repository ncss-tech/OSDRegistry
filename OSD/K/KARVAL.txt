KARVAL SERIES

The Karval series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Karval soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Mixed, mesic Ustic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Karval gravelly loamy sand, 5 to 25 percent slopes.  (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

  A--0 to 5 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine white (10YR 8/1) masses of calcium carbonate between peds; very slightly effervescent between peds; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

  AC--5 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine to medium roots; 20 percent gravel; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

  Bk1--14 to 40 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grain; few very fine and fine roots; common fine white (10YR 8/1) masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; 20 percent gravel; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (21 to 38 inches thick)

  Bk2--40 to 50 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grain; many fine white (10YR 8/1) masses of calcium carbonate; very slightly effervescent; 18 percent gravel; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 inches thick)

  C--50 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grain; 5 percent gravel; neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Calladito, Curtis Siding, Dwyer, Mido, Orpha, Pensom, Pinavetes, Tullock, Valent,and Wigton series.  The Calladito soils have average annual precipitation less than 11 inches.  The Curtis Siding soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Dwyer, Mido, Orpha, Pinavetes, Valent, and Wigton soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle size control section.  Penson and Tullock have bedrock at depths of less than 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium
Landform:  hill
Slope:  5 to 25 percent
Elevation:  4,000 to 6,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 47 to 53 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  11 to 16 inches
Frost-free period:  125 to 155 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fort, Midway, and Vonid series.  The Fort soils are nearly level and are fine-loamy.  The Midway soils are on hills and are shallow to shale.  The Vonid soils are on hills and are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  excessively drained, medium runoff, rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used as rangeland.  Native vegetation is mainly blue grama, galleta, little bluestem, and sides oats grama.
