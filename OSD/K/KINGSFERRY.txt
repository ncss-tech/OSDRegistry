KINGSFERRY SERIES

The Kingsferry series consists of very deep very poorly drained sandy soils that have a Bh horizon at a depth of 30 to 50 inches. They formed in thick deposits of sandy marine sediments. They are on nearly level, broad low flats on the flatwoods. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Umbric Alaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Kingsferry fine sand--forested (Colors are for moist soil).

A1--0 to 11 inches; black (10YR 2/1) fine sand; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine, common medium and few coarse roots; extremely acid, clear wavy boundary.

A2--11 to 17 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sand; single grained; loose; common fine roots; sand grains very thinly coated with organic matter; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

A3--17 to 34 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) fine sand; common medium faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) and few fine faint gray streaks; single grained; loose; few fine roots; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 20 to 47 inches)

Bh1--34 to 43 inches; very dark gray (5YR 3/1) fine sand; massive; very friable; sand grains coated with organic matter; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

Bh2--43 to 67 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) fine sand; common medium distinct black (5YR 2/1) weakly cemented fragments; massive; friable; sand grains coated with organic matter; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

Bh3--67 to 80 inches; black (5YR 2/1) fine sand; massive; very firm; weakly cemented; sand grains coated with organic matter, very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Nassau County, Florida, 5.5 miles northwest of Callahan, 1.6 miles west of county road 115, 0.1 mile north of logging road, 50 feet east of trail NW 1/4, NW 1/4, NW 1/4, sec. 10, T.2N, R.24E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness exceeds 80 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout. Depth to the spodic horizon is 30 to 50 inches. Texture is sand or fine sand in all horizons except the Bh horizon which includes loamy fine sand.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3. 

The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. 

The Bh horizon hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3. It is very friable to friable in the upper part and firm to very firm in the lower part. The lower part of the Bh horizon is weakly cemented in more than one-half of the horizon in each pedon. Depth to the firm or very firm weakly cemented Bh horizon is greater than 60 inches.

Some pedons have a bisequem of Bh, E' and B'h horizons with similar colors and textures of the overlying horizons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar soils are the Allanton, Boulogne, Evergreen, Leon, Lynn Haven, Murville, and Pottsburg series. Allanton and Pottsburg soils have Bh horizons with an upper boundary below a depth of 50 inches. Boulogne, Leon, Lynn Haven and Murville soils have Bh horizons with an upper boundary above depth of 30 inches. Evergreen soils have a histic epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kingsferry soils are on nearly level, broad, low flats on the flatwoods. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in thick beds of sandy marine deposits. The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 57 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Allanton, Boulogne, Evergreen, Leon, Lynn Haven, Murville, and Pottsburg and the Hurricane, Mandarin and Rutlege series. Hurricane and Mandarin soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on slightly elevated ridges. Rutlege soils lack a Bh horizon and occur on broad low flats, depressions, and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. Permeability is rapid in the A horizon, moderate in the upper part of the Bh horizon and slow in the lower part of the Bh horizon. A water table is at depths of 0 to 12 inches for 2 to 6 months. It recedes to a depth of 12 to 24 inches for 6 to 9 months during periods of low rainfall. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Kingsferry soils are used for forestry, range and improved pasture. Natural vegetation is sweetbay, longleaf and slash pine with an understory of waxmyrtle, large gallberry, inkberry, sawpalmetto, ferns, and pondweed. The most common native grass is pine and threeawn. Other grasses are bluestems and switchcane.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kingsferry soils are in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plain. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nassau County, Florida, 1987.

REMARKS: Classification changed from Arenic Haplaquods to Arenic Umbric Haplaquods, a recent addition to Soil Taxonomy, with this revision of the series.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Umbric epipedon and arenic properties--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 34 inches (A1, A2, A3 horizons)
Spodic horizons--the zone from 34 to 80 inches (Bh1, Bh2, Bh3 horizons).
