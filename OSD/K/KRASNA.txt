   rainfall.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Used mainly for cropland and pastureland. A few areas are in rangeland. Native vegetation includes bluestems and paspalums.
Ecological sites assigned to phases and components of this series are listed below.  Current ecological site assignments are in Web Soil Survey.  Components of this series include the following ecological sites: Northern Loamy Prairie

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fort Bend County, Texas, 2019. The name is the historical name given to the Wallis area by Czech immigrants that settled in the area.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Katy series. The series was separated based on its location on the Beaumont Formation of Fort Bend and Austin Counties.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
  Particle-size control section: 54 to 104 cm (21 to 41 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 54 cm (0 to 21in) (A and E horizons) 
  Argillic horizon: 54 to 203 cm (21 to 80in) (Bt and 2Bt horizons)
  Lithologic discontinuity: 106 to 203 cm (42 to 80 in) (2Bt horizons)

Additional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity was determined by the ratio of very fine sand to fine sand which is markedly different than the overlying horizons and coincides where the horizon color is 5YR or redder and the presence of mica flakes. The reddish subsoil and mica flakes are considered to be a marker of Colorado and Brazos River sediments.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Soil survey office lab data available on the typical pedon (NASIS user site id of S2019TX1573074)
