KAWAH SERIES

The Kawah series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in sandy coastal plain sediments mainly on the Carrizo geologic formation.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, coated Aquic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kawah fine sand on a 1 percent concave slope in forestland; elevation is 157 m (515 ft)  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) fine sand; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; many fine, medium, and common coarse roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness is 10 to 25 cm [4 to 10 in].)

  A2--15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 in); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; many fine, medium and common coarse roots; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness is 0 to 31 cm [0 to 12 in].)

  Bw--38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand; few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure parting to single grain; soft, very friable; few fine and medium roots; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness is 0 to 61 cm [0 to 24 in].)

  Bg1--76 to 147 cm (30 to 58 in); light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure parting to single grain; soft, very friable; few fine roots; strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness is 25 to 91 cm [10 to 36 in].)

  Bg2--147 to 203 cm (58 to 80 in); light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure parting to single grain; soft, very friable; few fine roots; common fine masses of iron-manganese; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chipley, Lotus and Pactolus series.
Chipley soils: lack B horizons, are lower in elevation, have higher organic matter in A horizons and higher annual precipitation.
Lotus soils: have buried A horizons and have 10 to 25 percent silt plus clay in the control section.
Pactolus soils: have 10 to 25 percent silt plus clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: sandy marine sediments of the Carrizo geological formation
Landscape: coastal plain
Landform: depressions
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 18 to 19 degrees C (65 to 67 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1118 to 1219 mm (44 to 48 in)
Frost-free period: 235 to 250 days
Elevation: 101 to 183 m (330 to 600 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Tonkawa (TX), Betis (TX), Naconiche (TX) and Darco (TX) series.  
Tonkawa, Betis and Darco soils: are higher in the landscape, do not have a water table within 100 cm (40 in) of the surface and are excessively or somewhat excessively drained.
Naconiche soils: are on lower flood plain positions and are very poorly drained with thick dark cumulic surface horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Permeability is rapid.  Runoff is negligible.  The soil is  saturated year round between a top depth of 46 to 91 cm (18 to 36 in) and a bottom depth of 203 cm (80 in).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for woodland.  Native vegetation consists of loblolly and shortleaf pine, water oak and sweetgum.  Common understory plants consists mainly of smilax, waxleaf myrtle, American beautyberry, and ratan. Grasslike species include rushes, sedges, switchgrass, broomsedge bluestem, and low panicums. Forbs that are common are goldenrod and asters.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Texas, Land Resource Region P; MLRA 133B; the series is of minor extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rusk County, Texas, 1993, Rusk County soil survey area, Texas, 1993. The name is coined.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Chipley series.  The series was separated based on presence of B horizons, organic matter content, elevation and rainfall.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section:  25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) (A2, Bw, Bg1)

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in).  (A horizons) 
Redoximorphic concentrations: 38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 in).  (Bw horizons)
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation at 76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 in).  (Bg horizons)
Aquic conditions: 76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 in)
