KEOKUK SERIES

The Keokuk series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable flood plain soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium. These soils are on nearly level flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 838 mm (33 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Fluventic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Keokuk silt loam-cultivated. at an elevation of 229 to 457 m (750 to 1500 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, very friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 46 cm [7 to 18 in]) 

    Bw--30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 20 to 66 cm [8 to 26 in]) 

    C--61 to 168 cm (24 to 65 in); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; stratified with a few layers of silt loam, loam, and loamy very fine sand that are 6 to 75 mm (0.25 to 3 in) thick; few films of secondary carbonates at a depth of 74 cm (29 in); calcareous; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: Lugert series is the only soil in this family. Soils in similar families are Asa, Asher, Lamkin, Loco, Lucien, Minco, Nash, Pocasset, and Reinach series. 
Asa, Asher, and Lamkin soils: have a fine-silty control section 
Loco and Lucien soils: are underlain with a paralithic sandstone bedrock between depths of 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in) 
Lugert soils: are dry for longer periods 
Minco and Nash soils: have secondary carbonates deeper than 91 cm (36 in). In addition, Nash soils are underlain with a paralithic sandstone bedrock between depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) 
Pocasset soils: have a coarse-loamy control section 
Reinach soils: have a mollic epipedon more than 51 cm (20 in) thick

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Asher soils and Amber, Dale, Gaddy, Lela, McLain, Port, and Yahola soils. 
Asher, Dale, Lela, and McLain soils: occur on similar positions, but are slightly concave 
Amber soils: are on side slopes and do not have a mollic epipedon 
Dale soils: have a mollic epipedon more than 51 cm (20 in) thick and a fine-silty control section 
Gaddy, Port, and Yahola soils: are usually in lower flood plains that are closer to the stream channel; in addition, Gaddy soils have a sandy control section 
Lela and McLain soils: have a fine control section 
Port soils: have a mollic epipedon more than 51 cm (20 in) thick and a fine-silty control section 
Yahola soils: have a coarse-loamy control section

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: well drained 
Permeability: moderate 
Runoff: slow 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly cultivated to alfalfa, wheat, grain sorghums, peanuts, and soybeans. A lesser acreage is used for tame pasture or rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly tall grasses with scattered bottomland hardwood trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Oklahoma; LRR-H; MLRA 80A-Central Rolling Red Prairies. The soil is of moderate extent.
