TYPE LOCATION: Mercer County, New Jersey; 3/4 mile east of Edgebrook and Route 130, Gruber Farm. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Solum thickness: Ranges from 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). 
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 183 cm (72 inches).
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: 46 to 107 cm (18 to 42 inches), October to June with wide seasonal fluctuation.
Rock Fragments: Rock fragments are lacking, or essentially so, in the solum.
Soil Reaction: Extremely acid to strongly acid, throughout the profile, unless limed
Other Features: Depth to coarser materials is typically more than 152 cm (60 inches). 

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS
The A or Ap horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chromas of 2 to 4. In unplowed areas the A horizon is about 10 cm (4 inches) thick and has value of 3 or 4. 
Texture--silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Some areas are eroded. 

The E horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 1 to 4.  
Texture--ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam.

The Bt horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 7, and chromas of 0 to 8 with 1 and 2 chromas only in the Btg horizon of some pedons. 
Texture--ranges from silty clay loam or clay loam to silty clay and clay. Some pedons have thin layers of silt loam. Mean clay content is about 40 percent in the control section.
Redoximorphic features--iron depletions with 2 or lower chroma are in the Bt horizon between 51 and 76 cm (20 and 30 inches) from the soil surface.  
Structure--commonly angular or subangular blocky, but prismatic or columnar structure occurs in many pedons and platy structure is found in a few pedons. 

The C or Cg horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 5Y, values of 2 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 8. High values and chroma are in moderately coarse and coarse textural strata. 
Texture--typically silty clay loam but ranges from clay to loamy sand. 
Other features--thin, discontinuous layers of ironstone 1 to 3 mm (1/16 to 1/8 inches) thick form in both vertical and horizontal fracture faces in the C horizon of some pedons. Pyrite nodules also occur in some pedons. 

COMPETING SERIES: 
Cruze soils--have paralithic contact at a depth of 122 to 203 cm (48 to 80 inches) 
Flatwoods soils--have bedrock at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)
Grassland (T) soils--have paralithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches)
Halifax soils--have mica flakes in the B and C horizons and have formed in residuum weathered from felsic igneous and metamorphic rocks
Kanuga soils--contain mica flakes,  a higher volume of rock fragments, and have formed in old alluvium washed from materials weathered from low or high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks 
Lackstown soils--allow redder colors in the substratum and have formed in residuum from Triassic rock, commonly fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, or shale
Latham soils--contain rock fragments of shale or siltstone and have paralithic contact with a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)
Zoar soils--have thinner sola and have formed in slackwater alluvium on the Appalachian Plateau.
