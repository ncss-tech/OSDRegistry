KNIGHT SERIES

The Knight series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils. Knight soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces and flood plain steps. Knight soils formed in loess or silty material and are underlain by loamy or coarser textured outwash. Slope is usually less than 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches) near the type location.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corley, Ebbert, Edgington, Marissa, Normal, Speed, Thorp, and Vesser series. Corley soils have part of the mollic epipedon below the albic horizon. Ebbert, Marissa, and Speed soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees) in the soil temperature control section. Edgington soils do not have loamy materials within a depth of 183 cm (72 inches). Normal soils have a matrix color with greater than 2 chroma in one or more horizons in the upper part of the series control section. Thorp soils have horizons with more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 137 cm (54 inches). Vesser soils contain more than 10 percent sand in the upper part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Knight soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and flood plain steps. Slope is usually less than 2 percent. They formed in less than 183 cm (72 inches) of loess or silty material and are underlain by loamy or coarse textured outwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 9.4 to 14.4 degrees C (49 to 58 degrees F), and annual precipitation ranges from about 610 to 1295 mm (24 to 51 inches) near the type location. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: They are the Elburn, Plano, Proctor, and Tama soils. All lack E horizons, are better drained, and are at somewhat higher elevations in the same general landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the solum and moerately high to high (4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the lower part of the solum and substratum. Permeability is moderately slow or moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderate to moderately rapid  in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. In normal years, the apparent seasonal high water table is at the surface to 31 cm (1 foot) below the surface in spring. Ponding depth is generally less than 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface. A rarely flooded phase has is recognized. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, and small grains. Native vegetation is prairie grasses tolerant of prolonged periods of wetness. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and northeastern Illinois. The extent is small in MLRAs 95B, 108A, and 108B

REMARKS: With this update (3/2006) the type location is relocated to a new site. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon -- the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches)  Albic horizon -- the zone from 25 to 56 centimeters [10 to 22 inches (Eg and BEg horizons)] Argillic horizon -- the zone from 56 to 135 centimeters [22 to 53 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizon)]
