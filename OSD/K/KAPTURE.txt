KAPTURE SERIES

The Kapture series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone. Kapture soils are on fan skirts and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, mesic Xeric Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Kapture loam--rangeland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 20 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

    C1-- 20 to 45 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 40 cm thick)

    C2--45 to 150 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

TYPE LOCATION: Sevier County, Utah; 1.5 miles east and 2 miles north of Richfield; 1,250 feet north and 450 feet east of southwest corner of section 17, T.23S. R.2W.; USGS Richfield 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 47 minutes 51 seconds N and longitude 112 degrees 3 minutes 5 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms; aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent
Rock fragments: Average less than 15 percent.

A horizon: 
Hue: 5YR or 2.5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist

C horizon:
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6 dry or moist
Texture: Loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam
Sand content: More than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand 
Rock fragments: Some pedons have 15 to 35 percent gravel below depths of 75 cm. 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 55 percent
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Rapho series. Rapho soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kapture soils are at elevations of 1,590 to 1,680 meters. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The soils occur on fan skirts. Kapture soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and sandstone. The climate is semiarid; the average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 8 to 10.5 degrees C. and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Redfield soils and Stillman soils. Redfield soils are fine-silty. Stillman soils are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated cropland and range. The native vegetation is shadscale, big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass and squirreltail. Irrigated crops are alfalfa, corn, barley and oats.  These soils are correlated to semidesert ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Utah, western Sevier County in the Sevier valley; MLRA D28A, E47; these soils are of small extent.
