KEZAN SERIES

The Kezan series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty alluvial sediments derived from loess and glacial till. These soils occur on flood plains of narrow upland drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters (28 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Mollic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kezan silt loam with a 1 percent, north-facing slope in an alfalfa field.  When described, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 23 centimeters(4 to 9 inches)thick) 

  C--15 to 33 centimeters (6 to 13 inches); stratified grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive with evident bedding planes; slightly hard, friable; few fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) iron masses in the soil matrix; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.   (15 to 30 centimeters(6 to 12 inches)thick) 

  Cg1--33 to 48 centimeters (13 to 19 inches); stratified dark gray (10YR 4/1) and grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive with evident bedding planes; slightly hard, friable; few fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) iron masses in the soil matrix; few fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) iron masses in the soil matrix; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 centimeters(4 to 10 inches)thick) 

  Cg2--48 to 81 centimeters (19 to 32 inches); stratified grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive with evident bedding planes; slightly hard, friable; few fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) iron masses in the soil matrix; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.   (25 to 51 centimeters(10 to 20 inches)thick)

  Agb1--81 to 112 centimeters (32 to 44 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; massive; hard, friable; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 38 centimeters(0 to 15 inches)thick)

  Agb2--112 to 153 centimeters (44 to 60 inches); dark gray (N4/0) silt loam, black (N2/0) moist; massive; hard, friable; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Butler County, Nebraska; 4.8 kilometers (3 miles) west of Brainard; 415 meters (1360 feet) south and 61 meters (200 feet) east of the northwest corner, sec. 14, T. 14 N., R. 3 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Typically, free calcium carbonate is not present in the profile, but in some pedons they occur at depths of 30 to 76 centimeters (12 to 30 inches).
Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is wet from 15 to 46 centimeters (6 to 18 inches) to more than 183 centimeters (72 inches) from November to June; Aquic moisture regime.
Depth to redox concentrations: 10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: This are the Ackmore and Quiver series. Ackmore soils have a depth to endosaturation of between 30 to 100 centimeters (12 to 40 inches). Quiver soils formed in areas of higher mean annual rainfall.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Silty alluvial sediments derived from loess and glacial till.
Landform: Flood plains
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature: 9.4 to 11.7 C (49 to 53 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 610 to 710 millimeters (24 to 28 inches)
Frost-free period: 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alcester, Aowa, Colo, Hobbs, Hord, and Judson soils.
Alcester and Judson soils formed in colluvial-alluvial material on foot
slopes and have a seasonal high water table below a depth of 2 meters (6 feet).
Judson soils are cumulic.
Aowa soils occupy similar landscape but are calcareous.
Colo soils are on similar landscape and are cumulic.
Hobbs soils are on similar landscapes and have a seasonal high water table below a depth of 2 meters (6 feet).
Hord soils formed in loess and alluvium on stream terraces, are cumulic and have a seasonal high water table below a depth of 2 meters (6 feet).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained. Runoff is low. Permeability is moderate. Occasionally or frequently flooded for brief periods from March to July, and the seasonal high water table ranges from 0.15 to 0.46 meters (0.5 to 1.5 feet).

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for pasture, range, or hayland. Cultivated areas that have been drained are in corn or sorghum. Common grasses are big and little bluestem, switchgrass, prairie cordgrass, varieties of sedges, and Kentucky bluegrass.  Willow and cottonwoods are common in many places. See Remarks section for native vegetative cover in Nebraska. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Kezan series is in the eastern part of
Nebraska and is moderately extensive.

In Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with sedges (Carex emoryi, C. laeviconica, C. pellita, C. vulpinoidea), flat stem spikerush, (Eleocharis compressa), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa Pratensis), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinate).
