KOLLS SERIES

The Kolls series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium. Kolls soils are on upland basins. Permeability is very slow. Slopes are 1 percent or less. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm (17 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hurley, Kyle, Millboro, Opal, Pierre and Promise soils 
Hurley -- have a natric horizon and are at the edges of basins.
Kyle -- are well drained soils on higher landscapes.
Millboro -- are formed in Pierre Shale on rolling uplands

Pierre -- are formed in Cretaceous shale and are well drained
Promise -- are formed in local sediment and are well drained

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class -- very poorly or poorly drained. No surface runoff occurs unless artificially drained. These soils are saturated for 30 to 60 days or more within a depth of 3 feet or more in most years.
Ponding -- periods of 15 to 60 days in most years from surface runoff from surrounding soils. 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity -- 0.01 to 0.42 micrometers per second except after periods of drought when initial intake may be rapid due to cracks.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly native range and hayland. Western wheatgrass is the principal native grass with smaller amounts of blue grama, buffalograss, and sedges. Ponded areas support a stand of spikesedge, reedgrass, cordgrass, and smartgrass.
