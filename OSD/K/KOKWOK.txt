KOKWOK SERIES

The Kokwok series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy, sandy, and gravelly alluvium on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, isotic over mixed Typic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kokwok silt loam, located on a flood plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 15 meters; when described on September 16th, 2008 the soil was moist throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 10 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; common fine roots, common medium roots, common coarse roots, and many very fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); clear smooth boundary

 AB--10 to 16 cm; 50 percent black (7.5YR 2.5/1) and 50 percent dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) silt loam; 30 percent sand; 65 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak fine granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, common medium roots, common coarse roots, and many very fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); clear smooth boundary

 Bw--16 to 100 cm; 50 percent brown (7.5YR 4/2) and 50 percent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) silt loam; 40 percent sand; 55 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots, few medium roots, few coarse roots, and common very fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear smooth boundary

 2C--100 to 183 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sand; 90 percent sand; 8 percent silt; 2 percent clay; massive; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots, few medium roots, few coarse roots, and few very fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.9)
