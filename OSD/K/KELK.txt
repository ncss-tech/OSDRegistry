KELK SERIES

The Kelk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and loess derived from volcanic rocks.  Kelk soils are on inset fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kelk soils are on inset fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, and fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium and loess derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 2,020 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bloor, Ocala, Prosser, and Settlemeyer soils.  Bloor soils have natric horizons.  Ocala soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Prosser soils are coarse-loamy and moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Settlemeyer soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons, and are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to very high surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Occasionally flooded and saline-sodic phases are recognized.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kelk soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and irrigated cropland.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and cheatgrass.  Irrigated areas are in alfalfa-small grain rotations.  Some areas of rangeland have been seeded to crested wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and central Nevada.  These soils are extensive with about 120,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRAs 24, 25, and 28B.
