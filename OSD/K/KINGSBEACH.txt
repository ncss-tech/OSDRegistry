KINGSBEACH SERIES


The Kingsbeach series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or colluvium derived from andesite over lacustrine deposits. The Kingsbeach soils are on alluvial fan. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 635 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Ultic Palexeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kingsbeach stony sandy loam on a south facing (170 degree), 4 percent slope at an elevation of 1914 meters. Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.

	Oi--0 to 3 cm; slightly decomposed plant material;

	A--3 to 15 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) stony sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine and few coarse roots throughout; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent stones and 5 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravels; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

	Bt1--15 to 51 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine and common medium and coarse roots throughout; common very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent clay bridges; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (13 to 50 cm thick)

	2Bt2--51 to 76 cm; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots throughout; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent clay films on surfaces along pores and 20 percent clay bridges; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (13 to 38 cm thick)

	2C--76 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam; structureless massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; 25 percent medium light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) masses of reduced iron at top of horizon; moderately acid (pH 5.6);

TYPE LOCATION: Placer County, California, One mile west of Kings Beach, 305 meters east and 91 meters north of the southwest corner of Section 12, Township 16 N, Range 17 E, 39 degrees, 14 minutes, 38 seconds North latitude and 120 degrees, 2 minutes, 42 seconds West longitude, NAD83 - U.S.G.S Quad: Kings Beach, California.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - usually dry for 45 to 75 consecutive days in late summer, moist rest of year. 

Water features:
  Seasonal high water table: During spring runoff the water movement through the profile is slowed down at the lithologic discontinuity.

  0 to 10 percent consisting of:
  0 to 5 percent gravel
  0 to 5 percent cobbles
  0 to 3 percent stones

Organic matter: as high as 5 percent in the A horizon and dropping off to less than 1 in the 2C horizon

Reaction: strongly to slightly acid

Base saturation: 35 to 75 percent. (By amonium acetate)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deerhill soils.  Deerhill soils have greater than 60 percent parafragments in the lower part and is on hillslopes and mountainsides.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kingsbeach soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from andesite over lacustrine deposits. Elevation is 1894 to 2046 meters. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 580 to 840 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C. The frost free season is 30 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Jorge and Tahoma soils. The Jorge soils are loamy-skeletal and are on hillsides and mountain slopes and the Tahoma soils are on mountain slopes and underlain by residuum derived from andesitic lahar.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, very slow permeability, medium runoff. These soils are not flooded or ponded

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife, recreation and urban development. Vegetation is mixed conifers.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kingsbeach soils are of minor extent in California in MLRA 22A -- Sierra Nevada Mountains
