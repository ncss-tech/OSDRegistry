KAYO SERIES

The Kayo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Kayo soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm.  The mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kayo very gravelly loamy sand - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 1 percent stones and 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    A2--8 to 28 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (combined thickness of A horizons is 15 to 30 cm)

    Bt--28 to 56 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak, fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; many faint and few distinct clay films bridging and coating mineral grains; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    C--56 to 94 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 55 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 100 cm thick)

   2Ck--94 to 152 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, and few fine and medium roots; very few tubular pores; 60 percent gravel; strongly effervescent with carbonates coating the gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2)

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; east side of Warm Springs Valley; 300 feet west and 300 feet south from northeast corner of section 10, T. 22 N., R. 21 E.; USGS Moses Rock 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 47 minutes 43 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 36 minutes 13 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.7952778 latitude, -119.6036111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Dry summer and fall, moist winter and spring; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Soil temperature:  8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to base of the Bt horizon: 30 to 60 cm.
Organic carbon:  Ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 percent in the upper 15 cm and 0.2 to 0.4 percent between 15 and 36 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  13 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments content:  Averages 35 to 50 percent, mostly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  5 dry and 3 moist in the upper part otherwise is 6 or 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction:  Slightly acid or neutral.

Bt horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture:  Coarse sandy loam or sandy loam, subhorizons of sandy clay loam are in some pedons.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or is massive
Reaction:  Slightly acid or neutral. Some pedons have lower subhorizons that are transitional to Bk horizons and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

C, Ck or Bk horizons
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Percent rock fragments:  50 to 65 percent.
Reaction:  Neutral to strongly alkaline, increasing with depth.
Other features:  Weak silica cementation is in some pedons below 100 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bairs, Basket, Breko, Chiefrange, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Huilepass, Hunewill, Jungo, Lithgow, Push, Schader, Stucky and Washoe series.

Bairs soils have 5 to 30 percent granitic stones and boulders in the particle-size control section. Basket, Breko, Chiefrange, and Huilepass soils are intermittently moist in some part due to convection storms between July and September. Cowgil, Hefed, Hunewill, Jungo Plush, Stucky, and Washoe soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Drino, Lithgow and Schader soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kayo soils are on fan piedmonts.   Elevations are 1,345 to 1,770 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with mean annual precipitation of 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature of 9 to 11 degrees C; and the frost-free season is about 100 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cassiro and Aladshi soils.  Cassiro soils are clayey-skeletal and have a mollic epipedon.  Aladshi soils are fine-loamy and have duric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well-drained or somewhat excessively drained; slow to medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland, wildlife habitat, and urban development.  Vegetation is principally spiny hopsage, low rabbitbrush, big sagebrush, desert peach, squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The soils are of moderate extent. MLRA 26.
