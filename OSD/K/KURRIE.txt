KURRIE SERIES 

The Kurrie series consists of well drained soils that are deep to grus and hard granite bedrock. These soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from hard coarse grained granitic rock deposited over granite bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, ridges and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.
