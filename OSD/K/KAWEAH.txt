KAWEAH SERIES

The Kaweah series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary and granitic rock. The Kaweah soils are on steep mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 100 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Pachic Ultic Haploxerolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kaweah soils are on steep linear to concave backslopes of mountain slopes or drainageways. Slopes range from 30 to 100 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary and granitic rock. Elevation is 745 to 2215 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 730 to 1030 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 9 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 150 to 255 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colonymill, Ladybug, and Whiskeylog soils. The Colonymill soils are on broadly convex, less steep backslopes of mountain slopes and have a clay increase that meets the requirements of an argillic horizon. The Ladybug soils are on shoulders of mountain slopes and are less than 50 cm to a lithic contact.  The Whiskeylog soils are on convex mountain slopes and lack a mollic epipedon (dark surface).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is canyon live oak, black oak, California bay laurel, incense cedar, gooseberry, and poison oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
