KAIPAROWITS SERIES

The Kaiparowits series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from sandstone, limestone, and chert.  Kaiparowits soils are on summits and sideslopes of low hills and ridges on plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Oxyaquic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kaiparowits gravelly silt loam - woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

	Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed mixed conifer and aspen litter. (0 to 3 inches thick)

(0 to 6 inches thick)

	E--12 to 20 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 20 inches thick)

	Bt1--20 to 39 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; strong coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots oriented along faces of peds; few very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; noneffervescent; strongly acid (pH 5.4); gradual smooth boundary.

	R/Cr--50 inches; fractured, very slightly to slightly weathered cherry fine-grained sandstone bedrock with irregular pockets of increasingly weathered cherry sandstone

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; located on GCNP fire road  about 1.0 miles south from intersection with highway 67 (intersection located about 1/8 mile south of picnic area on highway 67), and about 30 feet east of road; 36 degrees 15 minutes 34 seconds north latitude, 112 degrees 4 minutes 41 seconds west longitude.

Mean annual soil temperature - 38 to 47 degrees F

Depth to bedrock - 40 to 60 inches

Depth to argillic - 14 to 40 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average) - 

Clay content: 65 to 75 percent;  

Rock fragments: 5 to less than 35 percent 

A horizons 
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 3 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

E horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Clay content: 8 to 15 percent
Rock fragments: 20 to 70 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum from fine-grained sandstone, limestone, and chert
Landform: summits and side slopes of hills and ridges on plateaus
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent
Elevation: 7900 to 9700 feet
Mean annual temperature: 36 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 25 to 33 inches
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months: December through April
Driest months: May, June, October, and November
Frost-free period: 70 to 105 days.
 
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kanabownits and Kippers soils. Kanabownits soils are skeletal and do not have an argillic horizon.  Kippers soils have an aquic moisture regime and have redoximorphic features in the profile.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, medium to very high runoff, very slow permeability, saturated with water for 20 consecutive days or 30 or more days cumulative in March and April due to snow melt.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, timber production and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes White fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, Quaking aspen, and Ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kaibab Plateau above 8000 feet in north central Arizona; MLRA 35.  The series is of moderate extent.
