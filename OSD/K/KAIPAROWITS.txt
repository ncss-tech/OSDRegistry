KAIPAROWITS SERIES

The Kaiparowits series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from dolomitic limestone, sandstone, and chert. Kaiparowits soils are on summits and sideslopes of low hills and ridges on plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Oxyaquic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kaiparowits gravelly loam - woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 cm); slightly decomposed leaf litter.

     Oe--2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm); moderately decomposed mixed leaf litter.

     A1--3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots throughout; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 55 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.

     A2--6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine, common medium, and few coarse tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 65 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.

     E1--12 to 25 inches (30 to 64 cm); pink (7.5YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 65 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

     E2--25 to 38 inches (64 to 97 cm); pink (7.5YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 70 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt irregular boundary.

     Bt/Cr--38 to 46 inches (97 to 117 cm); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly clay, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium prismatic parting to strong fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots oriented along faces of peds; few fine roots throughout; few very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent gravel; noneffervescent; strongly acid (pH 5.3); abrupt smooth boundary.

     R--46 inches (117 cm); weathered chert and sandstone bedrock

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; located about 16.6 kilometers (10.3 miles) southwest of Kaibab Lodge, Arizona; USGS Quadrangle King Arthur Castle; Latitude 36.33607, Longitude -112.29070, Datum WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice. Udic ustic moisture regime based on precipitation.
Mean annual soil temperature - 38 to 47 degrees F
Depth to bedrock - 40 to 60 inches
Depth to argillic - 14 to 40 inches
Particle-size control section (weighted average) -
Clay content: 50 to 70 percent;
Rock fragments: 5 to less than 35 percent

A horizons
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 3 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

E horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Clay content: 8 to 15 percent
Rock fragments: 20 to 70 percent
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

Bt horizons
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 3 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist
Reaction: very strongly acid to slightly acid
Some pedons have Bw, Bt/E or E/Bt horizons

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum from fine-grained sandstone, limestone, and chert
Landform: summits and side slopes of hills and ridges on plateaus
Slopes: 2 to 40 percent
Elevation: 7800 to 8600 feet
Mean annual temperature: 36 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 25 to 33 inches
Precipitation pattern: Wettest months: December through April
Driest months: May, June, October, and November
Frost-free period: 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kanabownits and Kippers soils. Kanabownits soils are skeletal and do not have an argillic horizon. Kippers soils have an aquic moisture regime and have redoximorphic features in the profile.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, medium to very high runoff, very slow permeability, saturated with water for 20 consecutive days or 30 or more days cumulative in March and April due to snow melt.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, timber production and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes White fir, Douglas-fir, Quaking aspen, and Ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kaibab Plateau above 7800 feet in north central Arizona; MLRA 35. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.
