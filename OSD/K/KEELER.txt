KEELER SERIES 

The Keeler series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, hills, and ridges.  They formed in material weathered from granitic or metamorphic bedrock with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slope ranges from 10 to 75 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  

Bechtel soils:   are deep to a paralithic contact

Christoff soils:  have E horizons above the argillic with >60 percent ash

Sly soils:  have no decline in clay content with depth in the argillic


GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Keeler soils are on all aspects of mountain slopes, hills, and ridges.  Slopes range from 10 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from granitic or metamorphic bedrock with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 1,600 to 5,050 feet (488 to 1540 meters).  The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, average annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 65 inches (660 to 1651 mm), and the average frost-free period is from 50 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Threebear, Jacot, and Nakarna soils.  Threebear soils are on dissected terraces and toeslopes, and have a fragipan.  Jacot soils are on convex foothill slopes and are ashy over loamy.  Nakarna soils are on steeper north-facing mountain slopes and are ashy over loamy. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, and western larch, with an understory of queencup beadlily, goldthread, longtube twinflower, myrtle pachystima, common beargrass, bunchberry dogwood, thinleaf alder, common prince's pine, dampwoods blueberry, and whiteflower rhododendron. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  This soil is moderately extensive.
