KOKORUDA SERIES 

The Kokoruda series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on alluvial fans, swales, drainageways and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kokoruda loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; leaves, twigs, roots, and partially decomposed leaves and twigs. 

    A1--3 to 16 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and few fine pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. 

    A2--16 to 31 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) cobbly loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine, medium, and coarse pores; 15 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons - 18 to 38 cm) 

    Bt1--31 to 41 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; 15 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bt2--41 to 87 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds and bridging sand grains; 15 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons - 38 to 89 cm) 

    BC--87 to 156 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly clay loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent cobbles, 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1).
