KNOXDALE SERIES

The Knoxdale series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Dystric Fluventic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Knoxdale silt loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 215 meters (705 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; common medium and many fine roots; many faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coatings on faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary. [18 to 36 cm (7 to 14 inches) thick]

 Bw1--23 to 51 cm (9 to 20 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; common distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) worm casts; many faint brown (10YR 4/3) organic coatings on faces of peds; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--51 to 89 cm (20 to 35 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common distinct brown (10YR 4/3) worm casts; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) organic coatings on vertical faces of peds; few coarse faint brown (10YR 5/3) and distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 46 to 127 cm (18 to 50 inches).]

 BC--89 to 142 cm (35 to 56 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam with thin strata of silt loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few faint brown (10YR 4/3) worm casts; few faint brown (10YR 4/3) organic coatings on vertical partings; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 63 cm (25 inches) thick]

 C--142 to 203 cm (56 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) stratified sandy loam and loam with thin strata of loamy sand; massive; very friable; 2 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Paulding County, Ohio; approximately 2.5 miles northeast of the village of Antwerp, in Carryall Township; about 1190 feet south and 595 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 24, T. 3 N., R. 1 E.; USGS Antwerp, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat. 41 degrees 12 minutes 18 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 42 minutes 23 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum: 63 to 152 cm (25 to 60 inches)
Depth to the base of the cambic horizon: 63 to 152 cm (25 to 60 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches)
Depth to bedrock: greater than 203 cm (80 inches)
Rock fragments: predominantly of limestone, dolostone, and crystalline lithology

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 (6 or more dry)
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam or loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

A horizon, where present:
Thickness: 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 inches)
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent

Bw horizon, or BC horizon where present:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: mainly silt loam or loam, with thin subhorizons of clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in some pedons
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

C or Cg horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4, ranging to 1 or 2 in the lower part
Texture: loam, sandy loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam, with thin strata of loamy sand or loamy fine sand in some pedons; commonly stratified
Rock fragment content: 0 to 14 percent
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chagrin and Piankeshaw series. Chagrin soils do not have carbonates within 152 cm (60 inches). Piankeshaw soils have more than 14 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Knoxdale soils are on flood plains along streams in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium washed mainly from areas of calcareous loamy drift or lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 274 meters (600 to 900 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Defiance, Flatrock, Medway, Rossburg, Shoals, Sloan, and Wabasha soils. The moderately well drained Flatrock, somewhat poorly drained Shoals, and very poorly drained Sloan soils are members of the same drainage sequence and are on lower landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Defiance soils are on flats and in slight depressions. The very poorly drained Wabasha soils are in depressions and abandoned meanders. The well drained Rossburg and the moderately well drained Medway soils have mollic epipedons and are on similar landscape positions along major rivers and streams.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: A large portion is under cultivation. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, grass-legume mixtures, and wheat. Some areas are in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, principally ash, elm, hickory, hackberry, oak and sycamore.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 99 and 111B in northwestern and west-central Ohio. The type location is in MLRA 99. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Paulding County, Ohio, 1992.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 89 cm (Bw horizon).

The Knoxdale series is currently being correlated and separated from the Genesee series during modernization projects in MLRAs 99 and 111B. Some areas of Genesee soils were correlated as taxadjuncts (because of the presence of cambic horizons) to the Genesee series during the original surveys in northwestern Ohio.
