KANACKEY SERIES

The Kanackey series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from quartzite, schist and minor amounts of tuff.  The Kanackey soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, thermic Lithic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kanackey very gravelly loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 65 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones.

    A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many fine and medium vesicular, common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent pebbles; 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 7 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) very cobbly clay; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on peds faces and lining pores; 20 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt2--7 to 14 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) extremely cobbly clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; many moderately thick clay films on peds faces and lining pores; 25 percent pebbles, 45 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary (3 to 7 inches thick)

    R--14 inches; unweathered quartzite.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; 4 miles southwest of Johnnie and 350 feet north and 400 feet west of the southeast corner of section 23, T.  18 S., R. 52 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during the winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days following summer convection storms.

Soil temperature:  59 to 64 degrees F.

Depth to bedrock:  8 to 14 inches.


Control section - Clay content:  Averages 35 to 50 percent.

Rock fragments:  Average 50 to 65 percent pebbles and cobbles


A horizon Value:  6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist.

Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Effervescence:  Slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.



Bt horizons Hue:  5YR or 7.5YR.

Value: 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist.

Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist.

Texture of fine earth:  Clay or sandy clay.

Clay content:  40 to 55 percent.

Rock fragments:  35 to 55 percent in upper part; 50 to 75 percent the in lower part, mainly cobbles.

Effervescence:  Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.

Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Renbac, Luxor and Lehmans soils are similar.  The Renbac and Luxor soils have mixed mineralogy and the Lehmans soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kanackey soils are on mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum from quartzite, schist and minor amounts of tuff.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 3,300 to 4,200 feet.   The climate is semiarid with hot summers and cool moist winters, with occasional summer convectional rain storms.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is about 190 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Akela, Tecopa, and Zibate soils.  The Akela and Tecopa soils lack an argillic horizon.  Zibate soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wright eriogonum, white bursage, spiny menodora, ephedra, Anderson wolfberry, range ratany, spiny hopsage and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 30.
