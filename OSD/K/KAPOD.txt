KAPOD SERIES

The Kapod series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and limestone on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Butterfield , Red Butte, Schuelke and Tannahill series. 

Butterfield and Schuelke soils have a lithic contact between depths of 50 to 100 cm. Red Butte soils have a depth to the calcic of 33 to 50 cm and depth to base of Bt is 33 to 50 cm. Tannahill soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to basalt bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kapod soils are at elevations of 1,370 to 2,070 meters. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The soils occur on fan remnants, mountain slopes, hills and lake terraces formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from sandstone, quartzite and limestone. The climate is dry subhumid. The average annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm. Mean annual temperature is 7.0 to 11.0 degrees C, and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Birdow, DeJarnet, Forsgren, Kidman, Parleys, Timpanogos and Yeates Hollow soils and the competing Bingham and Middle soils. Birdow and DeJarnet soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm thick and lack argillic horizons. Forsgren soils have clay argillic horizons. Kidman soils have fine sandy loam control sections with less than 20 percent gravel. Parleys soils have clay loam argillic horizons and lack coarse fragments. Timpanogos soils have silt loam or loam argillic horizons and lack coarse fragments. Yeates Hollow soils have clay argillic horizons and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing. Small acreages of this soil near Tooele are used for non-irrigated alfalfa. The native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, Great Basin wildrye, bitterbrush, western wheatgrass, and big sagebrush. In Utah this series is correlated with upland range sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and Central Utah. This soil is moderately extensive. MLRA 25 and 28A.
