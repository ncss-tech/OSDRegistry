KANORADO SERIES

The Kanorado series consists of deep well drained soils that formed in loess over residuum weathered from calcareous shale.  Kanorado soils are on uplands and side slopes to major drainages.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.) at the type location.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Denby, Echeta and Gojiya series.
Denby soils formed in clayey over silty sediments weathered from sodium rich sedimentary rocks.
Echeta soils do not have a paralithic contact.
Gojiya soils have endosaturation at 127 to 203 centimeters (50 to 80 inches)  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: convex upland and side slopes of breaks adjacent to major drainageways
Parent material: loess over residuum from calcareous shale
Slopes: 0 to 25 percent
Average annual precipitation: 36 to 51 centimeters (14 to 20 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C. (46 to 54 degrees F.)
Frost free days: 130 to 175 Days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canyon, Heldt, Kim, Midway, Stoneham and Sully soils.  
Canyon soils are shallow over weakly cemented limestone.  
Heldt, Kim, Stoneham and Sully soils are very deep.   
Kim and Stoneham soils have fine-loamy control sections.  
Midway soils are shallow over shale.  
Sully soils have coarse-silty control sections and are higher on the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:     moderately low  
Runoff: medium or rapid, depending on the degree of slope

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage of this soil is in native rangeland. 
Some areas are in dryland cropland.  
Wheat and sorghum are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Kansas, southwestern Nebraska and Northeastern Colorado.  The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dundy County, Nebraska, 1995.  The name is from a town near the Kansas-Colorado border.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches)
Calcic horizon: 64 to 91 centimeters (25 to 36 inches)
Paralithic contact: 122 centimeters (48 inches)

Particle size class and mineralogy of this soil are questionable, samples have been sent to KSU lab.
The Kanorado soils were previously mapped with the Razor soils which are Aridisols.  Razor soils are typically mapped in areas with less than 14 inches of average annual precipitation.

Modified format by LRM in 1/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
