KENDALLVILLE SERIES

The Kendallville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying outwash and loamy till. These soils are on moraines, kames, eskers, and outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

Douds, Kliever, Nodine, Pecatonica, Plumcreek, Renova, Rockbridge, Westville, and Wykoff soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Grellton soils do not have rock fragments within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Letort soils do not have glacial pebbles in the lower part of the series control section. Lindley soils do not have subhorizons in the argillic horizon that have more than 5 percent rock fragments. McHenry soils do not have textures with less than 55 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Theresa soils do not have a layer of outwash overlying the till.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kendallville soils are on moraines, kames, eskers, and outwash terraces of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying outwash and loamy till. Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days. Elevation is 192 to 373 meters (630 to 1225 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eldean, Fox, Miami, Miamian, and Ockley soils. Eldean, Fox and Ockley soils do not have a till substratum within 152 cm (60 inches) and are on similar landscape positions. Miami and Miamian soils do not have outwash material in the solum and are on similar landscape positions. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The depth to a seasonal high water table is greater than 183 cm (6 feet). The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most Kendallville soils are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, and legume meadow. A small proportion is in permanent pasture or woodlots. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous hardwoods consisting mainly of oaks, maple, and hickory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111A, 111B, 111D in western Ohio and Indiana, and MLRA 98 in southern Michigan. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Noble County, Indiana, 1947.

REMARKS: Lab data for the type location (CH-41) shows that the particle-size class is fine textured. This series needs to be reevaluated under the MLRA concept and a new type location established. Also the color of the clay films were not in the original description of the 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons so it was considered the same color as the matrix color. Roots were also not described but were entered in the Ap and Bt horizons because of the type of the vegetation in the field.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 18 to 76 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedons FR-51, PY-24, PY-26, and CH-41 (the type location) for available laboratory characterization data from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.
