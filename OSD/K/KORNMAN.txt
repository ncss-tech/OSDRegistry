KORNMAN SERIES

The Kornman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Kornman soils are on stream terraces.  The surface horizons formed in alluvium from sediment-rich irrigation water while the subsoil and substratum formed in mixed alluvium from sedimentary materials.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Prowers County, Colorado, 1963.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Series control section: 0 to 200 centimeters 
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches).
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches). (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)
Cambic horizon: 46 to 64 centimeters (18 to 25 inches) (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon: 91 to 132 centimeters (36 to 52 inches) (Bk2 horizon).

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

LAN 3/2013  Based on field documentation from an update field project, the type location was moved from Prowers County, Colorado to Otero County, Colorado and the consistent appearance of a mollic epipedon and calcic horizon changes the taxonomic class to coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls.
