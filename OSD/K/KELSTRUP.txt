KELSTRUP SERIES

The Kelstrup series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  These soils are on relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kelstrup silt loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bw2--8 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 7 to 16 inches).

    Bk1--14 to 28 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk2--28 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:

Hingham (MT) - does not have a calcic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - relict stream terraces.
Elevation - 4,200 to 5,000 feet.
Slope - 0 to 15 percent.
Parent material - loess.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 16 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 95 to 115 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kelstrup soils are used as nonirrigated cropland, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The principal crops are barley and winter wheat.  Potential native vegetation includes bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needleandthread, western wheatgrass, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kelstrup soils are of small extent in the intermountain valleys of southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record: MT1451. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 8 inches (Ap, Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 8 to 14 inches (Bw2 horizon); a calcic horizon from 14 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2, Bk1, Bk2 horizons).  Kelstrup soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
