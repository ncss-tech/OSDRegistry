KAMELA SERIES

The Kamela series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt, with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface. Kamela soils are on mountains and have slopes of 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kamela stony ashy silt loam, timbered. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Oi--0 to 2 inches; duff, needles, twigs and leaves.

   A--2 to 8 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) stony ashy silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

   Bw--8 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) extremely cobbly ashy silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent stones, 35 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (14 to 35 inches thick)

   R--27 inches; fractured basalt

TYPE LOCATION: Union County, Oregon; road cut along logging road; northeast 1/4 southwest 1/4 northeast 1/4, sec. 32, T. 3 S., R. 38 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 20 to 40 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent. The particle-size control section has 35 to 75 percent rock fragments and 18 to 27 percent clay. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 4 moist, 4 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy loam with 12 to 20 percent field estimated clay. It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 5 to 25 percent gravel. Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral.

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy loam with 18 to 27 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 5 to 45 percent cobbles and 10 to 35 percent gravel. Soil reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kamela soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains. Elevations are 3,000 to 6,200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt with some influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface. The climate is characterized by cold and moist winters and warm and dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anatone, Bocker, Klicker, Loneridge, Olot, and Tolo soils. Anatone and Bocker soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock. Klicker soils have an argillic horizon. Loneridge soils are clayey-skeletal and are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock. Olot soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal. Tolo soils are ashy over loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability. 
USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for timber production. They are used also for wildlife habitat. Native vegetation dominantly is grand fir, Douglas fir, ponderosa pine and some western larch. Understory vegetation is willow, oceanspray, rocky mountain maple, ninebark, false Solomons seal, snowberry, elk sedge, pinegrass, heartleaf arnica and princes pine. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Oregon; MLRA 9. The series is of moderate extent.
