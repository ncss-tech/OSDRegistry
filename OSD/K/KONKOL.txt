KONKOL SERIES

The Konkol series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in volcanic ash, alluvium and lacustrine sediments.  They are on hills on plateaus and low mountain ridges and have slopes of 5 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Jaype and Hildebrand series. Jaype soils are slowly permeable in some layer in the subsoil and have buried argillic horizons.  Hildebrand soils are moderately well drained with redox features at 12 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Konkol soils are on uhills on plateaus and low ridges at elevations of 3000 to 3,550 feet.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments thinly mantled by volcanic ash.  The average annual air temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grangemont, Kauder, Revling and Statemeadow series.  Grangemont soils are on undulating plateaus and are fine-silty.  Kauder soils are on undulating plateaus and have a fragipan.  Revling soils are on undulating plateaus and have a thick ash cap.  Statemeadow soils are on undulating plateaus and have a highly mixed ash cap.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used primarily for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and watershed.  The natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas fir, western larch and western white pine with an understory of queencup beadlily, goldthread, longtube twinflower, bunchberry dogwood, rocky mountain maple and common snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Idaho; Konkol soils are not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
