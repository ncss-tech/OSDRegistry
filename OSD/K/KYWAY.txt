KYWAY SERIES

The Kyway series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on foothills. These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from eolian materials, volcanic ash and rhyolite. Kyway soils have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Kyway sandy loam, on a 5 percent slope with south aspect at 6200 feet elevation, in a Douglas-fir/whorteleaf snowberry plant association, woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots, few fine through coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    A2--8 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through coarse roots; many very fine and common fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    A3--18 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick)

    Bw--27 to 32 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine through medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    R--32 to 42 inches; hard rhyolite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Fremont County, Idaho, about 6 miles north of Ashton; about 900 feet north and 2100 feet west of the southeast corner of section 26, T. 10 N., R 42 E.; Latitude- 44 degrees North, 09 minutes, 40 seconds; Longitude - 111 degrees West, 27 minutes, 45 seconds.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean annual soil temperature - 39 to 42 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature - 52 to 59 degrees F.
Moisture control section - between 8 and 24 inches. The soil is dry throughout the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the four months following the summer solstice.
Mollic epipedon thickness - 16 to 40 inches.
Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches.
Volcanic glass content - 5 to 30 percent in the 0.2 to 2.0 mm size fraction.
Ammonium oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 Fe - 0.1 to 1.0 percent.
Phosphate retention - 20 to 50 percent.

A horizons - Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3, 4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry; 1, 2 or 3 moist
Clay content: 10 to 14 percent
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent
Pebbles: 0 to 10 percent
Cobbles: 0 to 5 percent
Stones: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction: pH 6.1 to 7.3

Bw horizon - Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2, 3 or 4 dry or moist
Clay content: 10 to 14 percent
Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent
Pebbles: 0 to 10 percent
Cobbles: 0 to 5 percent
Stones: 0 to 5 percent
Reaction: pH 6.1 to 7.3

COMPETING SERIES:

Medrick (tCO) - Have a mollic epipedon 6 to 10 inches thick, are very deep, and have an aridic-ustic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - foothills.
Elevation - 5600 to 6300 feet.
Slope - 4 to 30 percent.
Parent material - local alluvium or colluvium derived from eolian materials, volcanic ash and rhyolite.
Climate - Winters are moist and cool, summers are warm and dry. A winter snowpack of 2 to 4 feet in depth and lasting through mid April is common. 
Mean annual temperature - 37 to 40 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 22 inches.
Frost free period - 40 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lag and Sadorus series. Lag soils are in more moist positions on nearby foothills and mountians. They are very deep and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the particle size control section. Sadorus soils are in slightly warmer positions on nearby foothills. They are less than 20 inches deep to hard bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium to rapid runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Kyway soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat. These soils commonly support communities which have a shrub layer of bigtooth maple, mountain big sagebrush or whortleleaf snowberry with an herbaceous layer dominated by bluebunch wheatgrass, California brome or elk sedge. The potential natural vegetation is the Douglas-fir/whortleleaf snowberry plant association.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. They are of small extent.
