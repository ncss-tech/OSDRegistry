KALSTED SERIES 

The Kalsted series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium, colluvium or eolian material.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, stream terraces, hills and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kalsted sandy loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bw--7 to 11 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bk1--11 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and continuous distinct calcium carbonate coatings on surface of gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 23 inches thick) 

    Bk2--30 to 54 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, stratified with thin lenses of loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; continuous distinct calcium carbonate coatings on surface of gravel, and many fine and medium masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 30 inches thick) 

    BC--54 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, stratified with common thin lenses of loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).
