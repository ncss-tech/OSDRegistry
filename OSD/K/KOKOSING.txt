KOKOSING SERIES

The Kokosing series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Aquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kokosing sand, on a west-facing, 1 percent slope in an idle field at an elevation of 259 meters (850 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on September 21, 1994 the soil was dry to 24 inches and moist below.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable, slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

[10 to 38 cm (4 to 15 inches) thick]

 2Bt--96 to 135 cm (38 to 53 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; many fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; 5 percent gravel; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 2C--135 to 203 cm (53 to 80 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam; massive; firm; few faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films in cracks; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent throughout; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kokosing soils are on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in sandy outwash and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 130 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kawkawlin, Morganlake, and Sims series. Kawkawlin soils do not have sandy Bw horizons and are on similar landscapes. Morganlake soils are moderately well drained, have spodic horizons, and are on slightly higher landscape positions. Sims soils are poorly drained, do not have sandy mantles or argillic horizons, and are in depressions and along drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 inches) between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy upper part and moderately high in the lower loamy part. Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper part and moderate in the lower loamy part.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in cropland and are used for small grains, corn, and hay. Some areas are forested or are idle. Native vegetation includes quaking aspen, paper birch, red maple, bracken fern, low sweet blueberry, and wild-lily-of-the-valley.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northeastern lower peninsula of Michigan. This series is of small extent.
