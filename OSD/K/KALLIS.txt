KALLIS SERIES

The Kallis series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in coarse grained colluvium derived from granite. These soils are on mountain slopes, hills, and escarpments. Slopes are 4 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kallis very gravelly coarse sandy loam, in sparsely forested rangeland on a 32 percent slope at 1,244 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

	A--0 to 13 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 17 cm thick) 

	Bw--13 to 36 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 32 cm thick) 

	C1--36 to 82 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary. (22 to 136 cm thick) 

	C2--82 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bitterroot Valley Area, Montana, 2013; proposed in Ravalli County, Montana, 2012.

REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 13 cm (A horizon)
Cambic horizon - from 13 to 36 cm (Bw horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the Bw, C1, and part of the C2 horizons)
