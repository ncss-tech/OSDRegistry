TYPICAL PEDON: Krome very gravelly loam on a low rise in a cropped field.  (Colors are for moist unless otherwise stated.)

    Akp--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable, soft; 40 percent limestone gravel; finely disseminated carbonates; strongly effervescent with 1N HCl; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt irregular boundary. [5 to 25 centimeters 2 to 10 inches) thick]

    R--18 centimeters (7 inches); weakly to strongly cemented rippable oolitic limestone; solution holes up to 61 centimeters (24 inches) or deeper can be filled with similar material.

R horizon: weakly to strongly cemented porous rippable oolitic limestone.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Keyvaca series. 
Keyvaca soils: have 5 to 25 percent rock cobble size fragments within the control section, have water tables at depths of less than 100 centimeters, and are subject to rare flooding from hurricanes, and occur on the islands of Key West.
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): low broad flats and low rises on the Miami ridge
Parent material: loamy-skeletal residuum over oolitic limestone bedrock
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 27 degrees C (73 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1570 millimeters (37 to 62 inches)
Frost-free period: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biscayne, Chekika, Opalocka, Pennsuco and Perrine soils. 
Biscayne, Pennsuco, and Perrine soils: lack more than 15 percent limestone fragments, have more than 50 percent silt by average, and are poorly or very poorly drained and occur on lower positions.  
Chekika soils: are somewhat poorly drained and occur on similar positions.  
Opalocka soils: have sandy textures throughout, do not have a dark soil surface, and occur over limestone bedrock on low broad ridges or hills of the Miami Ridge.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: Moderately well drained, the water table in areas of the Krome soils is within the limestone bedrock.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Moderately high to high
Runoff: high to very high
Depth to seasonal high-water table: 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) and is within the limestone bedrock

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: citrus, avocadoes, subtropical fruits, truck crops, and urban land.  
Dominant vegetation: scattered slash pine and saw palmetto. The understory vegetation includes various grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area: Florida Everglades and associated areas
Land Resource Region: U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop and Range Region
Major Land Resource Area: 156A
