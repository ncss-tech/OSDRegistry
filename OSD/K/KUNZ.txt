KUNZ SERIES

The Kunz series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Kunz soils are on plateaus and mountainsides and have slopes of 8 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

(0 to 10 inches thick)

    BC--48 to 61 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few coarse and medium, common fine and very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Washington County, Utah; about one mile east of Thorley Point in northeast; about 2,400 feet south and 1900 feet west of the northeast corner section 9, T. 39 S., R. 10 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature: 40 to 47 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature: 57 to 62 degrees F.

Soil moisture regime: Intermittently moist in all parts December through March and intermittently moist in some part July through September. Driest during May and June. Typic ustic soil moisture regime.

Thickness of the solum: 30 to 60 inches or more  
After mixing the upper 7 inches of the soil, the dry value is 5 or less and moist value is 3 or less, but is too thin to qualify as a mollic epipedon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alderon (WY), Allens Park (CO), Bayerton (WY), Belltower (MT), Elbeth (CO), Elbuck (NM), Elmark (MT), Haugan (MT), Heflin (CO), Hoyt (MT), Jemco (CO), Jemez (NM), Kwiavu (CO), Littlepine (CO), Losindios (NM), Lumpgulch (MT), Northrim (CO), Plome (CO), Rule (T) (CO), Shoemaker (NM), Sweetweed (MT), and Tunitcha (NM) series. Alderon, Bayerton, Belltower, Elmark and Lumpgulch soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Allens Park, Jemco, Jemez, and Shoemaker soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Elbeth soils have an albic horizon and are dry in the winter.  Elbuck soils are slightly acid or more acidic and average more than 45 percent sand. Heflun soils have the base of the argillic horizon at less than  30 inches. Sweetweed soils have a glossic horizon. Haugan soils have secondary calcium carbonate. Plome soils have hues of 10R to 5YR. Rule soils are inactive. In addition Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Belltower, Elbeth, Elbuck, Elmark, Haugan, Hoyt, Jemco, Jemez, Littlepine, Losindios, Lumpgulch, Plome, Rule, and Sweetweed soils are moist in the soil moisture contral section during May and June. Kwaivu and Northrim soils are inadequately competed on soil properties and qualities.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kunz soils are on mountain slopes, hills and footslopes at elevations of 6,000 to 8,600 feet. Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent. These soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and slope alluvium weathered from sandstone, shale, basalt and limestone. The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F. The freeze-free period ranges from 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Detra soils. Detra soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Potential vegetation is Gambel oak, serviceberry, snowberry, Oregon grape, wild rose, lupine, and tall native bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Utah, northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona.  MLRAs 35, 39.  These soils are of moderate extent.
