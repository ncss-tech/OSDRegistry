KAYIWISH SERIES

The Kayiwish series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in meta-volcanic rock. Kayiwish soils are on hills. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Leptic Haploxererts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kayiwish loam, on the toe slope of a hill at an elevation of 790 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches (0 to 10 centimeters); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bss--4 to 21 inches (10 to 53 centimeters); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; many continuous  distinct intersecting slickensides on ped faces; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (18 to 34 inches thick)

    BC--21 to 24 inches (53 to 60 centimeters); mixed matrix 70 percent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and 30 percent brown (10YR 4/3) clay, 70 percent very dark brown (10YR 2/2) and 30 percent dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; medium angular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Cr--24 to 27 inches (60 to 68 centimeters); soft, easily diggable meta-volcanic rock.

TYPE LOCATION: Ventura County, California; in Serrano Valley; 460 feet west and 2200 feet south of the northeast corner of section 9, T. 1 S., R. 20 W.; Latitude 34 degrees, 5 minutes, 48 seconds north and Longitude 119 degrees, 58 minutes, 23 seconds west; Point Mugu Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.
Soil moisture: Soil is moist in middle to late November to August in most years. The upper 10 to 20 inches of the soil dries in June or July in most years.

Soil cracks: Cracks occur in the soil that are 1 to 5 centimeters (1/2 to 2 inches) wide to a depth of 10 to 20 inches. These cracks are open in most years from June or July through middle to late November.

Depth to paralithic material: 20 to 40 inches.

A and Bss horizons--10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3, 3/2, 3/3 and 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 2/2 moist.
Clay percentage--40 to 55 percent.
Coarse fragments--0 to 10 percent.

BC horizon is absent in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kayiwish soils are on toe slopes of hills. These soils formed in meta-volcanic rock. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 380 to 2100 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches, the mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F., and the frost free season is to 290 to 350 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cotharin and Talepop series. Both these soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the soil surface on the side slopes of hills and mountains and do not have slickensides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; medium to very high runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat, recreation and building site development.
Vegetation is non-native annual grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ventura County and Los Angeles County, California. The soil is not extensive. MLRA 20.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ventura County, California, 1999.

REMARKS: The series name is from an ancient local American Indian village.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Mollic epipedon--The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 21 inches.

Paralithic material--The zone from a depth of 24 inches to about 27 inches.
