KADYGULCH SERIES 

The Kadygulch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from coarse- and fine-grained igneous rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, escarpments, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 cm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kadygulch gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry colors unless otherwise noted). 

     Oi--0 to 5 cm; partially decomposed twigs and needles. (3 to 10 cm thick) 

     A--5 to 15 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine and common medium pores; 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick) 

     E--15 to 33 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; commom fine and medium and few coarse roots; many very fine and common fine and medium pores; 40 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 30 cm thick) 

     Bw1--33 to 53 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; common very fine, fine and medium pores; 35 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary. 

     Bw2--53 to 91 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine, fine and medium pores; 55 percent pebbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 45 to 80 cm). 

     BC--91 to 157 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine, fine and medium pores; 10 percent cobbles; 55 percent pebbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2).
