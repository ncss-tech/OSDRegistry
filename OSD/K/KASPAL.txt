KASPAL SERIES

The Kaspal series consists of deep to a petrocalcic, well drained soils on fan piedmonts. They formed in mixed alluvium from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Petroargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kaspal very gravelly sandy loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 5 percent cobbles and 40 percent pebbles.

    A--0 to 2 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 3 percent cobbles, 37 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Btk1--2 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; common moderately thick clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; common fine and medium lime filaments; 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Btk2--11 to 34 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many fine and medium roots; common fine and few medium tubular pores; few thin clay film lining pores; common pressure faces; many fine and medium lime masses; 5 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (15 to 25 inches thick)

    2Bk--34 to 47 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; few medium tubular pores;  many thick lime coatings and pendants on the sides and undersides of rock fragments; weakly lime cemented matrix; 45 percent cobbles, 30 percent pebbles; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (11 to 18 inches thick)

    2Bkm--47 inches; indurated petrocalcic horizon.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; approximately 21 miles east of U.S. Highway 93 and 3.5 miles northwest of the Kane Springs Road in Kane Springs Valley; about 2000 feet east and 1000 feet north of the projected southwest corner of section 7, T. 9 S., R. 65 E.; 37 degrees, 10 minutes, and 35 seconds north latitude, 114 degrees, 45 minutes, and 17 seconds west longitude.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kaspal soils are on fan piedmonts.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 3200 to 3800 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with hot summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Canutio soils.  The Canutio soils contain less than 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragment in their control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, range ratany, big galleta, cholla, banana yucca, and indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  Kaspal soils are not extensive.  MLRA 30.
