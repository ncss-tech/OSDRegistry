KELLYCREEK SERIES

The Kellycreek series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from red, calcareous conglomerate or other red sedimentary rock.   These soils occur on hills, escarpments and eroded fan remnants. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kellycreek gravelly sandy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A--0 to 13 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 15 cm thick)

 Bk1--13 to 46 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; 3 percent fine soft masses of calcium carbonate, 50 percent distinct calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; strongly effervescent;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 40 cm thick)

 Bk2--46 to 84 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; 10 percent fine soft masses of calcium carbonate, 50 percent distinct calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

 BCk--84 to 97 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy sand, reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 45 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, 50 percent distinct calcium carbonate coats on rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 35 cm thick)

 Cr--97 to 152 cm; red (10R 5/6) calcareous moderately cemented conglomerate bedrock that crushes to loamy sand.
