KAUFMAN SERIES

The Kaufman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from mudstone.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains on river valleys and dissected plains. Slopes are typically less than 1 percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1193.8 mm (47 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).

Burleson soils: have fine textured control sections and are on treads of stream terraces
Crockett soils: have fine textured control sections and are on adjacent ridges on inland dissected coastal plains
Deport soils: have fine textured control sections, and are on adjacent ridges on dissected plains, and are formed from cretaceous residuum derived from shale and mudstone
Garner soils: have fine textured control sections, have a seasonal water table, and occur on adjacent stream terraces
Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson soils: occur on adjacent ridges and plains on dissected plains and have fine textured control sections

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is medium. Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked and very slowly when it is wet. Occasionally to frequently flooded for brief to long durations per year.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most cleared areas are in pasture of dallisgrass, bermudagrass, and fescues.  A few areas are used for producing cotton, corn, sorghums, and soybeans.  Native vegetation is hardwoods such as elm, hackberry, oak, ash, and grasses which includes species of andropogon, paspalum, panicum, and tripsacum.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Flood plains of streams draining Blackland Prairies from Texas to Alabama.  The series is extensive.
