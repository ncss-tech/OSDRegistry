KAWKAWLIN SERIES

The Kawkawlin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in moderately fine and fine textured till on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, frigid Aquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kawkawlin loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak coarse granular structure; friable; many fine roots; about 1 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 E--20 to 28 cm (8 to 11 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; weak coarse granular structure; friable; many fine roots; about 1 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [0 to 13 cm (5 inches) thick]

 B/E--28 to 41 cm (11 to 16 inches); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam (Bt) occupies about 85 percent of the horizon surrounded by grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry (E); weak medium subangular blocky structure; many fine roots; few medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; few medium distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions throughout; about 2 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. [5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 inches) thick]

 Bt--41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots, chiefly along faces of peds; thin to thick clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; common medium prominent reddish gray (5YR 5/2) iron depletions throughout; about 2 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [20 to 46 cm (8 to 18 inches) thick]

 Cg--66 to 152 cm (26 to 60 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam; weak medium angular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron throughout; 2 percent gravel; 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bowers, Pinewood, and Selkirk series. Bowers soils do not have rock fragments in the series control section and are stratified in the lower part. Pinewood soils have sandy textures in the lower part of the series control section. Selkirk soils average more than 45 clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kawkawlin soils are on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Kawkawlin soils formed in moderately fine and fine textured till of Wisconsinan age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kent, McBride, Menominee, Nester, Selkirk, Sims, and Twining soils. The moderately well drained Nester soils and the poorly drained Sims soils are in the same drainage sequence. Kent, McBride, Selkirk, and Twining soils are on nearby ground moraines. Kent soils are moderately well drained and have argillic horizons averaging 45 to 60 percent clay. McBride soils are fine-loamy and have fragipans. Selkirk soils are somewhat poorly drained and have 45 to 60 percent clay. The somewhat poorly drained Twinning soils are fine-loamy. Menominee soils are on nearby slight rises on ground moraines or along old drainageways or old beach lines. Menominee soils have sandy upper horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between October and May in normal years. Potential surface runoff is high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large part of the area is in small grains, soybeans, and hay, and some is in sugar beets and corn. A smaller part of the area is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is forest of sugar maple, northern red oak, American basswood, quaking aspen, and white ash.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 93B, 94A, 94B, 96, and 98 in northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. This series is of large extent.
