KUMLA SERIES

The Kumla series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils formed in organic material over coarse loamy cryoturbate and eolian deposits on talfs of plains. Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Dysic, subgelic Typic Folistels

TYPICAL PEDON: Kumla peat, located on a plain talf with a slope of 2 percent and elevation of 98 meters; when described on August 22nd, 2010 the soil was saturated at 42 cm (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 44 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots, common fine roots, and common medium roots; extremely acid (pH 4.4); clear smooth boundary

 Ajj--44 to 76 cm; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) stratified highly organic sandy loam; 55 percent sand; 40 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak medium granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine roots; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear wavy boundary

 ACf--76 to 183 cm; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) permanently frozen silt loam; 20 percent sand; 75 percent silt; 5 percent clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very firm, nonsticky, nonplastic; strongly acid (pH 5.3)
