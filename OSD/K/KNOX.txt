KNOX SERIES

The Knox series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on strongly dissected hills and bluffs bordering the Missouri River Valley and its tributaries. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature air is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters.
