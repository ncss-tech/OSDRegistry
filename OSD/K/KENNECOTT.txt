GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: these are the Centuu, Ellisgap, Fishwheel, and Ride series.
Centuu soils are well drained, have an mollic epipedon, and occur on river valleys and alluvial fans.
Ellisgap soils are a poorly drained, have permafrost, have histic epipedons, have cryoturbation starting begins between 14 and 27 cm (6 to 11 in) deep, and occur in river valleys and terraces.
Fishwheel soils are moderately well drained, have a mollic epipedon, and occur on terraces and glacial valley floors.
Ride soils are somewhat excessively drained, and occur on mountain slopes and hillslopes.
