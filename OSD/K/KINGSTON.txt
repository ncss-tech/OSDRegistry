KINGSTON SERIES

The Kingston series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in very deep silty calcareous lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains and moraines. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Kingston silty clay loam, on a  convex slope of  1 percent on a glacial lake plain in a cultivated field, at an elevation of about 350 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ap--0 to 20 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt smooth boundary.

     A1--20 to 33 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--33 to 41 centimeters; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bg1--41 to 51 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) coatings on faces of peds; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common dark colored krotovinas; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bg2--51 to 63 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam; many fine light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) Fe concentrations; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    C--63 to 152 centimeters; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) silt loam; common fine faint olive gray (5Y 5/2) and olive (5Y 5/3) Fe depletions; weak thin to thick platy structure; very friable; slightly effervescent ; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6). 

TYPE LOCATION: Meeker County, Minnesota; about 3 miles north and 6 miles east of Litchfield; about 494 meters north and 31 meters west of southeast corner of sec. 26, T. 120 N., R. 30 W. ; USGS Forest City quadrangle; lat. 45 degrees 10 minutes 14 seconds N and long. 94 degrees 23 minutes 59 seconds W., NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amana, Breeds, Grantcenter, Joy, Joyce, Klingmore, Klinger, Lakefield, Larpenteur, Mccreath, Muscatine, Nerwoods, Okabena, Primghar, Ransom, and Tara 
Amana soils have thicker sola, lack free carbonates within a depth of 150 centimeters. 
Breeds soils have paralithic contact within 152 centimeters. 
Grantcenter soils have more than 8 percent fine sand in the particle size control section. 
Joy, Klinger, and Muscatine soils have thicker sola. 
Joyce soils have more than 70 percent sand in the lower third of the series control section. 
Lakefield soils have carbonates within 25 centimeters. 
Klingmore soils have moist bulk density range of 1.8g/cc to 2.0g/cc in the lower third of the series control section. 
Larpenteur soils have carbonates within a depth of 25 centimeters. 
Mccreath soils have moist bulk density range of 1.6 g/cc to 1.8 g/cc in the lower half of the series control section. 
Nerwoods soils have carbonates between depths of 102 to 203 centimeters. 
Okabena soils have 2 to 8 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section 
Primghar soils formed in loess and have more clay in the A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon. 
Ransom soils have loam or clay loam 2B or 2C horizons at depths of less than 102 centimeters.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or slightly convex slopes on glacial lake plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in very deep, calcareous, silty lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsinan age. Mean annual temperature is approximately 6 to 11 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is approximately 61 to 93 centimeters. Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 210 to 560 meters. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are typically the Madelia and Truman series. The well drained Truman soils are on rolling slopes. The poorly drained Madelia soils are on nearly level slopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained-a saturated zone occurs within depths of 30 to 60 centimeters during the wettest period of normal years in natural conditions. 
The saturated hydraulic conductivity 1.41 to 14.11 micrometer per second.. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated.  The principal crops are corn and soybeans.  The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tallgrass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA-103. Central and southern Minnesota and north- central Iowa. Moderately extensive.
