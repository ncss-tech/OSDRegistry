MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Patrick County, Virginia, 2008.

REMARKS: Kibler soils were previously mapped as Edneytown soils. Few faint clay films in the B horizon indicate translocation of clay has occurred; however, laboratory data does not support an argillic horizon. Kibler soils have a dark surface that is too thin for an Umbric epipedon. It is anticipated once the current Humudepts/Dystrudepts taxonomy proposal is approved, Kibler soils will be reclassified as Humic Dystrudepts.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 8 to 32 inches (Bt and BCt horizons)
Paralithic contact--54 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)
Paralithic materials--32 to 54 inches (Cr layer)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 56 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (Lab Pedon Number: 99P0446; User Pedon ID: 99VA141009).
