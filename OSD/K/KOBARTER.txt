KOBARTER SERIES 

The Kobarter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from semiconsolidated shale and siltstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, knolls and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kobarter clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick) 

   Bw--5 to 18 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bkz--18 to 48 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silty clay, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; disseminated lime, common fine threads of lime; 5 percent pebbles; few fine threads of soluble salts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 50 inches thick) 

    Bz--48 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; few fine threads of soluble salts; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.  

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records: MT1568.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, Bw horizons); a cambic horizon from 5 to 18 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bkz horizons); horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation from 18 to 48 inches (Bkz horizon); horizons of soluble salt accumulation from 18 to 60 inches (Bkz, Bz horizons).  Kobarter soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
