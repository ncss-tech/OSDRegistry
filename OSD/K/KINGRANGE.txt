KINGRANGE SERIES

The Kingrange series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from metasedimentary rocks. Kingrange soils are moderately deep to bedrock with cracks closer than 10 centimeters apart. Kingrange soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over fragmental, mixed, superactive, isomesic Dystric Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kingrange on a northwest facing 45 percent slope under Douglas-fir, tanoak, and Pacific madrone at an elevation of 451 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) When described on 07/15/2008, the soil was dry throughout.

 Oi--0 to 3 centimeters; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) unrubbed slightly decomposed plant material, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moist and very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) rubbed moist; about 100 percent fiber, 90 percent rubbed; nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 5 centimeters thick)

 A--3 to 15 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/3) gravelly loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 25 centimeters thick)

 Bw1--15 to 40 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, many medium, and common coarse and very coarse roots throughout; common very fine, few fine and common medium tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.

 Bw2--40 to 65 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) very gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine, and common medium, coarse, and very coarse roots throughout; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; 45 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 25 to 95 centimeters)

 C--65 to 200 centimeters; gravel; bedrock with fractures closer than 10 centimeters apart; few very fine, fine, and common medium and coarse roots in cracks; 90 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles. (100 to 150 centimeters thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California; about 2 kilometers northeast of Shelter Cove CA; USGS Shelter Cove Quadrangle; UTM zone 10 410496mE, 4432414mN; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Temperature:  The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 9 to 11 degrees C. (48 to 51 degrees F) and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is less than 6 degrees C. The soil has an isomesic soil temperature regime.

Soil Moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years and it is moist in some part for more than 180 cumulative days or for 90 or more consecutive days per year. The soil has an ustic soil moisture regime.

Depth to bedrock with cracks closer than 10 centimeters apart: 50 to 100 centimeters

Surface Fragments: 0 to 14 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones

Base Saturation: less than 60 percent by ammonium acetate in some horizons between 25 and 75 centimeters from the mineral soil surface
Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 5 to 20 percent clay
Rock fragments: 35 to 60 percent in the upper part and 90 percent or greater in the lower part

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 4 to 6, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist
Clay content: 10 to 19 percent
Rock fragments: 15 to 34 percent very strongly cemented metasedimentary gravel
Reaction: moderately to slightly acid

Bw horizons:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 6 or 7, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Texture of fine earth: loam, sandy loam
Clay content: 10 to 25 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 85 percent very strongly cemented metasedimentary gravel, 0 to 14 percent cobbles.
Reaction: slightly acid

C horizons:
Rock fragments: 90 to 95 percent very strongly cemented metasedimentary gravel, 0 to 14 percent cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kingrange soils are on convex positions on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 150 to 730 meters. These soils formed in residuum derived from metasedimentary rocks. The climate is sub humid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canoecreek and Sproulish soils Canoecreek and Sproulish soils lack bedrock with cracks closer than 10 centimeters apart within 150 centimeters. Sproulish soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Canoecreek and Sproulish soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation. Natural vegetation includes Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone, California huckleberry, and western swordfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.
