KELLERBUTTE SERIES

The Kellerbutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium weathered from granitic or porphyritic volcanic rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash. These soils are on mountain backslopes and footslopes. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brannan, Capoose, Crackler, Elbowlake, Farway, Kootenai, Natapoc, Nevine, Ochillee (T), Olot, Rouen, Saska, Twocolor (T), and Vingulch series. Brannan and Crackler soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Capoose, Olot, Rouen and Vingulch are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Elbowlake soils have 10 to 40 percent channers and have 2Cd horizons of compact glacial till in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Farway soils are dominated by sedimentary and volcanic rock fragments of glacial till origin in the lower particle-size control section. Kootenai soils are dominated by rock fragments of glacial outwash origin in the lower particle-size control section and have sandy textures above 40 inches. Natapoc and Nevine soils have 2Cd horizons of compact glacial till in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Saska soils have pumice fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section and subrounded rock fragments of glacial till origin in the lower part.  Twocolor soils have 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass in the ashy part of the pscs and rounded rock fragments in the lower lo-skel part of the pscs.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kellerbutte soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains at elevations of 2,000 to 5,000 feet. These soils formed colluvium weathered from granitic or porphyritic volcanic rocks with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent on primarily west, north, or east-facing aspects. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches and up to 42 inches in Spokane County. The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free season is 80 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearspring, Brevco, Canteen, Centralpeak, Ohscow, Togo, and the competing Capoose soils. Bearspring and Ohscow soils are loamy-skeletal and are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains. Brevco soils are loamy-skeletal, and are on southeast to southwest-facing slopes on backslopes and shoulder slopes of mountains. Canteen and Centralpeak soils are coarse-loamy. Canteen soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains and Centralpeak soils are on ridges, shoulders, backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of mountains. Togo soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal and have a cryic temperature regime. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the control section and high in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, watershed, and livestock grazing. The potential natural vegetation is grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of pinegrass, mallow ninebark, and pachystima. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central and northeastern Washington; MLRA 43. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Colville Indian Reservation; Ferry County, Washington, 1987. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Oi, Oe, and A horizons) 

Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 18 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons) 

Andic properties - the zone from 1 to 18 inches (A, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons) 

Particle-size control section - the zone from 1 to 41 inches horizon) with 1 to 18 inches qualifying as ashy (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizon) and 18 to 41 inches qualifying as loamy-skeletal (2C1 and part of the 2C2 horizon) 

The discontinuity in the 2C1 horizon represents the limit of andic soil properties and influence of air-fall volcanic ash. 

The dominant concept of the Kellerbutte series is a 60 to 75 dry day zone in the Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine habitat type. The dry day range has been expanded to 45 to 75 dry days to account for a moist phase of the grand fir habitat type recognized in Spokane County, Washington. 

Depths to diagnostic features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer. 

Classification revised 6/92 from ashy over loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Vitrandepts to ashy over loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Vitrixerands. Classification revised 10/01 from ashy over loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Typic Vitrixerands to ashy over loamy-skeletal, glassy over isotic, frigid Typic Vitrixerands.
