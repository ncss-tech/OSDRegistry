KOSZTA SERIES

The Koszta series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.

series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 33 centimeters (Ap and E horizons);
albic horizon--the zone from 20 to 33 centimeters (E horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 53 to 122 centimeters (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons);
aquic moisture regime.

Aqualfs suborder based on morphology of typical pedon.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
