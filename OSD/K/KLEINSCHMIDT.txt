KLEINSCHMIDT SERIES

The Kleinschmidt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that have extremely cobbly loamy sand at depths of 30 to 48 inches.  These soils formed in alluvium and are on alluvial fans, flood plains, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kleinschmidt gravelly loam in cropland (colors are for dry unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic, many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 8 inches thick)

    A--7 to 14 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; 35 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw1--14 to 28 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, medium, and coarse roots, and many fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; 5 percent cobbles, 40 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 18 inches thick)

    Bw2--28 to 37 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; few fine distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) redox concentrations; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, many fine, and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 10 percent cobbles, 40 percent pebbles; few faint lime casts on undersides of coarse fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (9 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bk--37 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely cobbly loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 35 percent cobbles, 35 percent pebbles; continuous distinct lime casts on underside of coarse fragments, disseminated lime; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Powell County, Montana 1995.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1240.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 14 inches (A horizons); a cambic horizon from 14 to 37 inches (Bw horizons); a lithologic discontinuity of extremely cobbly loamy sand at a depth of 37 inches (2Bk horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (A, Bw, 2Bk horizons).  Kleinschmidt soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aquic.
