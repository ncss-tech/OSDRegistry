KIRVIN SERIES

The Kirvin series consists of deep, well drained soils.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils formed in stratified sandstone and shale derived from marine sediments on uplands of the Claiborne geological group.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 8 percent but range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Freestone County, Texas, 1918.

REMARKS:  The series was updated in 2002 to allow very strongly acid reaction in the A horizon and strongly acid reaction in the C or Cd horizon based on documentation collected in Shelby County, Texas. The series was updated in 2004 to allow a BCt horizon below the Bt horizon in some pedons.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: 28 to 78 (11 to 31 in).  (Bt horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in).  (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 28 to 119 cm (11 to 47 in).  (Bt and BCt horizons)

Additional Comments: 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S72TEX-212-1 from Smith County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data from OSD type location, S72TEX-212-1.  Particle-size analysis tests have been performed at various soil survey offices on over 50 pedons.
