KRUTAR SERIES 

The Krutar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Krutar loam, pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and  slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bw--8 to 13 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few medium and common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles, 20 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; continuous distinct lime coatings on undersides of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk--13 to 21 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent pebbles, 15 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; continuous distinct lime casts on rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

    2C--21 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very cobbly loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 25 percent pebbles, 30 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; continuous distinct lime coatings on sides of rock fragments and continuous prominent lime casts on undersides of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - alluvial fans; stream terraces. 
Elevation - 3,600 to 5,700 feet. 
Slope - 0 to 4 percent. 
Parent material - alluvium. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability above the sandy-skeletal material and rapid in the sandy-skeletal material. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Krutar soils are used mainly for irrigated and nonirrigated pasture and for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Columbia needlegrass, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Krutar soils are of small extent  in mountain valleys of western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT1497.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 8 to 13 inches (Bw horizon); a calcic horizon from 13 to 60 inches (Bk, 2C horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk, 2C horizons).  Krutar soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
