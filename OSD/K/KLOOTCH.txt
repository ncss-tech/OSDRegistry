KLOOTCH SERIES

The Klootch series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils formed in material weathered from granite with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountains and have slopes ranging from 15 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Klootch gravelly sandy loam on a 48 percent northwest facing slope, forested, at 2760 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described the soil was moist throughout.) 

    0i--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs. 

    0e--1 to 1.5 inch; well decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs. 

    A--1.5 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; very soft, very friable, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 30 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bw1--6 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, few very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 16 inches thick) 

    Bw2--12 to 27 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; few fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (12 to 18 inches thick) 

    R--27 inches; hard fractured granite.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Afley, Bracos,Jeru, Leighcan, Marsell, and Oatman series.  Afley and Bracos soils have more than 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Jeru, Leighcan, Marsell, and Oatman soils lack bedrock within depths of 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klootch soils are on mountains at elevations of 2,600 to 3,600 feet.  The slope range is 15 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in weathered granite with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash. The average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F; average annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches; and the frost-free season is 60 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ardtoo, Hun, Priestlake, and Treble soils.  Ardtoo and Treble soils have an average summer soil temperature more than 47 degrees F, and are deep and very deep.  Priestlake soils formed in glacial till and are very deep.  Hun soils have a high content of volcanic ash and are deep. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained.  Runoff is rapid to very rapid.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  A few areas are used for limited livestock grazing.  Natural vegetation typically is western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, western hemlock and paper birch with an understory of myrtle pachystima, common princes pine, northern twinflower, common beargrass, low Oregon-grape, fairyslipper orchid, starry false-Solomons-seal, rose, queencup beadlily, and big blueberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho.  The soils of this series are not extensive.

Remarks:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (A and part of Bw1 horizon); a cambic horizon from 6 to 27 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); a lithic contact at 27 inches (R horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 27 inches (part of the Bw1 and the Bw2 horizon). Klootch soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.
