KOFFGO SERIES 

The Koffgo series consists of very deep, well drained soils on canyonsides, tablelands, plateaus, hills and mountain slopes.  They formed in volcanic ash over slope alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. Permeability in the surface is moderate and moderately rapid in the subsoil and substratum.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Koffgo ashy silt loam, on a 6 percent convex ridge in an area of lodgepole pine/pinegrass plant community type at an elevation of 6,360 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; forest litter; needles, cones, and twigs.

(17 to 50 inches thick)

    C--51 to 60 inches; white (N 8/) fragmental rhyolite, gray (N 5/) moist; 20 percent gravel, 70 percent flaggstones, and 5 percent channers; few very fine and fine roots occuring in fractures and hanging in voids; few fine brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist clay films on undersides of rocks and on top of rocks under silt like films; 5 percent irregular coarse voids between rock fragments; no fine earth material in voids.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data (8/96) NSSL, Lincoln, NE. Client assigned lab number S94ID-043-004.
Project file number: 95P 27. Lab assigned number: Pedon 95P 151. Samples: 95P 1035-1038.

Koffgo soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic moisture regime.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
