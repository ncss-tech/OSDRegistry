KOSCIUSKO SERIES

The Kosciusko series consists of well drained soils formed in loamy gravelly outwash on outwash plains, kames, and moraines. They are moderately deep stratified calcareous, very gravelly coarse sand.  Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kosciusko sandy loam - on a 1 percent convex slope in cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sandy loam; brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 28 cm (5 to 11 inches) thick]

 Bt1--20 to 38 cm (8 to 15 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; thin patchy reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--38 to 58 cm (15 to 23 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; thin discontinuous dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of Bt horizon is 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches).]

 Bt3--58 to 76 cm (23 to 30 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; thin patchy dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) clay films on gravel; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 BC--76 to 86 cm (30 to 34 inches); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) gravelly loamy sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; 20 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. [20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 inches) thick]

 2C--86 to 152 cm (34 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Steuben County, Indiana; 850 feet north and 2,100 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 12, T. 37 N., R. 12 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 61 to 40 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Depth to calcareous very gravelly coarse sand: 61 to 40 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 55 to 70 percent sand
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sandy loam or loam or the gravelly analogues of these textures; eroded areas are sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 20 percent

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 15 to 35 percent

BC horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam or loamy sand

Tongues of the BC extend into the 2C horizon for a few centimeters to several meters at varying intervals; a thin "Beta B" is at the contact of the solum and the 2C horizon in most pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amanda, Belmont, Belmore, Caprell, Chili, Cliftycreek, Conestoga, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, High Gap, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, LeRoy, Lumberton, Martinsville, Military, Mocksville, Ockley, Pignut, Princeton, Relay, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Strawn, Wawaka, Wawasee, and Woodbine series. Amanda and Caprell soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon. Belmont, High Gap, Lumberton, Military, Pignut, and Woodbine soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Belmore and Kidder soils have textures finer than coarse sand in the lower part of the series control section. Chili, Kanawha, and Skelton soils have sola thicker than 102 cm (40 inches). Cliftycreek, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, Martinsville, Ockley, Princeton, Richardville, and Riddles soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Conestoga, Hollinger, Senachwine, Wawaka, and Wawasee soils average less than 55 percent sand in the particle-size control section. LeRoy and Strawn soils are less than 61 cm (24 inches) to carbonates. Mocksville soils are in a wetter climate with a mean annual precipitation of more than 1016 mm (40 inches). Relay soils do not have rock fragments dominated by igneous pebbles.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kosciusko soils are on outwash plains, kames, and moraines that have plane or convex surfaces. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Kosciusko soils formed in loamy gravelly outwash overlying stratified calcareous, very gravelly coarse sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.8 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boyer, Casco, Ockley, Oshtemo, and Sebewa soils. Boyer soils are on similar slopes but are coarse-loamy. The somewhat excessively drained Casco soils are on similar slopes but have thinner sola. Ockley and Oshtemo soils are on nearby landscapes and have thicker sola. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Sebewa soils are on nearby landscapes and have mollic epipedons and skeletal control sections.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on the slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Native vegetation is hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 98 and 111C in northern Indiana. The series is of moderate extent.
