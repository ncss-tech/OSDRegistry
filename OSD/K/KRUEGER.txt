KRUEGER SERIES

The Krueger series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuff. Krueger soils are on fan remnants and alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carey Lake (ID), Dunford (UT), Hades (UT), Hurryback (ID), Lagnaf T (UT), Mahogan (CA), Marotz (ID), Moffspring (ID), Nagle (OR), Needapepper (CA), Sag (OR), Strom (ID), and Tusk (NV) series. Carey Lake soils have relict mottles in the lower part of the profile. Dunford soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 inches). Hades soils have an A horizon more than 50 cm (20 inches) thick and are moderately acid through neutral.  Hurryback soils are neutral in the Bt horizon. Lagnaf soils have more than 20 percent rock fragments within the control section.  Mahogan soils have bedrock at 75 to 100 cm (30 to 40 inches). Marotz soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments within the control section. Moffspring soils have argillic horizons that are less than 40 cm (15 inches) thick. Nagle soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during summer and early fall. Needapepper soils are usually dry July through early October and have argillic horizons that extend beyond 152 centimeters. Sag soils have bedrock at 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 inches) and can have up to 25 percent rock fragments in the upper Bt horizon. Strom soils have mottles at a depth of 75 to 113 cm (30 to 45 inches) and are somewhat poorly drained. Tusk soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Alluvium from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuff
Landform: Fan remnants and alluvial flats
Slope: 0 to 15 percent
Elevation: 1,981 to 2,490 m (6,500 to 8,150 feet)
Climate: Semiarid
Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 406 mm (12 to 16 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C (39 to 45 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 70 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Acord and Watkins Ridge soils. Acord and Watkins Ridge soils have a mollic epipedon less than 50 cm (20 inches) thick. Also, Acord soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the Bt2 horizon. Watkins Ridge soils lack an argillic horizon and have a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for range and irrigated cropland. The native vegetation is big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, rabbit brush and yellow brush. These soils are correlated to Upland ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and southern Utah, MLRA 47. The series is inextensive.
