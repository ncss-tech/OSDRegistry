KEERINS SERIES

The Keerins series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale, sandstone, limestone, and conglomerate.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Keerins channery ashy sandy clay loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 1 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) channery ashy sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; 28 percent channers and 2 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy bounday. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt--1 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) very flaggy sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine dendritic tubular pores; common faint patchy clay films on faces of peds, rock fragments and lining pores; 25 percent channers and 25 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Btk1--8 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely channery sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; common faint patchy clay films on faces of peds, rock fragments and lining pores; finely disseminated carbonates throughout; 60 percent channers, 25 percent flagstones; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Btk2--11 to16 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) extremely channery sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; very fine and fine granular structure; loose, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; very few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; common clay films lining interstitial pores and on rock fragments; finely disseminated carbonates throughout; 50 percent channers and 30 percent flagstone; violently effervescent slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear irregular boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick)

    Cr--16 to18 inches; fractured moderately cemented calcareous sandstone. (1 to 10 inches thick)

    R--18 inches; indurated calcareous sandstone

COMPETING SERIES: These are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - Keerins soils are on crests, nose slopes, interfluves and convex sideslopes on hills
Slope gradient - 0 to 65 percent
Parent material - colluvium and residuum from channery shale, sandstone, limestone, or conglomerate (a very minor influence of volcanic ash is present in the surface horizon of some pedons)
Elevation - 3400 to 5500 feet
Climate - cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers
Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 16 inches
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 46 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 40 to 100 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gerow, Izee, Logdell, and Utley soils.  Gerow soils are very deep somewhat poorly drained and occur in drainageways.  Izee soils are moderately deep and occur on north facing backslopes, footslopes, sideslopes, and headslopes.  Logdell soils occur on convex nose slopes and crests and have a base saturation less than 75 percent in one or more  horizons.  Utley soils are deep and very deep and occur on toeslopes, footslopes, and baseslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very high surface runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Keerins soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.  Low sagebrush may occur where bedrock is not highly fractured and is indurated.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and Eastern Oregon, MLRA 10.  This soil is of moderate extent.
