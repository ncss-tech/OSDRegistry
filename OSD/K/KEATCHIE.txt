GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Keithville, Latex, Metcalf, and Scottsville series, and the Eastwood, Frierson, Hallsummit, and Timpson series. Keithville, Latex, Metcalf, and Scottsville soils are on similar landscapes. The Keithville and Metcalf soils have fine-silty sediments over a clayey discontinuity and the Latex and Scottsville soils have fine-loamy sediments over a clayey discontinuity.  Eastwood and Hallsummit soils have red clayey Bt horizons.  Eastwood soils are found on gently sloping ridges and moderately steep side slopes along drainage ways.  Hallsummit soils are found on slightly higher convex ridge tops.  Frierson soils are found on slightly convex ridge tops and have red loamy Bt horizons.  Timpson soils are found on slightly lower mounded landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Keatchie soils are well drained. They have moderate permeability. Runoff on 1 to 3 percent is very low, 3 to 5 percent is low, and 5 to 8 percent is medium. The soil is wet in the layers below a depth of 122 to 183 cm (4 to 6 ft) during the winter and spring seasons in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Principal use is woodland with dominant species of pine such as loblolly and shortleaf and many oak species and other southern hardwoods. Some areas are in pasture. Pastures are mainly in improved or common bermudagrass, bahiagrass, overseeded with legumes of crison and arrowleaf clovers, vetch or singletary peas. Small areas are farmed to hay, and truck crops. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mainly in the Southern Coastal Plain of eastern Texas and Oklahoma. The series is of moderate extent.
