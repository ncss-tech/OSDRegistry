KANARANZI SERIES

The Kanaranzi series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a loamy mantle over sandy or sandy-skeletal sediments on outwash plains and valley trains. They have moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the underlying material. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 millimeters (29 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Kanaranzi silt loam, on a slightly convex slope of 1 percent, on a glacial outwash plain, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 centimeter (6 to 10 inches) thick] 

 BA--18 to 30 centimeter (7 to 12 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) coats on faces of peds; weak fine prismatic structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; friable; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 18 centimeter (0 to 7 inches) thick] 

 Bw--30 to 51 centimeter (12 to 20 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) coats on faces of peds; weak medium prismatic structure; friable; slightly acid in upper part grading to neutral in lower part; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 30 centimeter (4 to 12 inches) thick] 

 2C1--51 to 66 centimeter (20 to 26 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) mixed with grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 20 percent coarse fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 20 centimeter (0 to 8 inches) thick] 

 2C2--66 to 127 centimeter (26 to 50 inches); mixed gray (10YR 5/1) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 20 percent coarse fragments; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [ 0 to 51 centimeter (0 to 20 inches) thick] 

 2C3--127 to 203 centimeter (50 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cott, Fairhaven, Vanpetten, Wadena and Waukee series. The Cott, Fairhaven, Wadena and Waukee soils have an upper loamy mantle more than 61 centimeters (24 inches) thick. The Vanpetten soils have loamy glacial till above depths of 150 centimeters (60 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kanaranzi soils are on plane to slightly convex positions on outwash plains and valley trains. Slope gradients are 0 to 15 percent. The Kanaranzi soils formed in a mantle of loamy glacial outwash 36 to 61 centimeters (14 to 24 inches) thick overlying calcareous sandy and gravelly sediments. These deposits are Late Wisconsinan in age. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 660 to 813 millimeters (26 to 32 inches). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The main ones are the Biscay, Salida, and Wadena soils. The Biscay soils are poorly drained and are on lower lying positions. The Salida soils are excessively drained and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain. The well drained Wadena soils are on terrain similar to that of the Kanaranzi series. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is low or medium. Permeability is moderate in upper mantle and rapid in underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Largely cropped to corn and soybeans. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Minnesota and northern Iowa. Moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nobles County, Minnesota, 1970. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: mollic epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 30 centimeters (12 inches) (Ap and BA horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from about 30 to 50 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) (Bw horizon); udic moisture regime. 

Surface texture changed to silt loam from loam based on a field visit to the OSD pedon location.
