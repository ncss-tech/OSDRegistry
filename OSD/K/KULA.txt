KULA SERIES

The Kula series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock.  Kula soils are on uplands and have slopes of 4 to 40 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial, amorphic, isothermic Humic Haplustands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kula cobbly loam - pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  All textures are for "apparent field textures.")

     A1--0 to 8 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) cobbly loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) dry, weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many medium pores; many very small red and black particles visible under hand lens; slight effervescence with hydrogen peroxide; slightly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 10 inches thick)

     B21--8 to 19 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many medium pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 13 inches thick)

     B22--19 to 30 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silt loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many medium and coarse pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt irregular boundary.  (10 to 12 inches thick)

     IIB23b--30 to 42 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine and medium pores; nearly continuous gelatin-like coatings of peds; many sand-size aggregates that are resistant to crushing; common worm casts 10 to 15 mm. in size; many very fine roots matted along surfaces of worm casts; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 13 inches thick)

     lIB3b--42 to 54 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) dry; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots and many fine medium pores; 30 to 40 percent weathered andesite and basalt fragments; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick)

     IICr--54 inches; weathered andesite and basalt with thin seams of soil material in cracks.

TYPE LOCATION:  Island of Maui, Maui County, Hawaii; Kilohana Quadrangle - 20 degrees 45' 40" north latitude and 156 degrees 19' 22" west longitude; 200 feet east of machine tool shed on Kula Branch of the University of Hawaii Experiment Station farm, about 0.4 mile east of Waiakoa.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of soil ranges from 45 to 60 inches to weathered andesite and basalt.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 or 4 dry.  The B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist or dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist.  It is loam or silty clay loam.  Structure in IIB horizon ranges from strong to moderate.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kamaoa, Kinkoni, Naalehu, Palapalai, and Waimea series.  Kamaoa soils have strong structure in the A horizon and weak structure in the B horizon and lack a buried B horizon.  Kikoni soils have strong structure in the A horizon and a massive upper B horizon.  Naalehu soils are weakly smeary in the B horizon and have a mean annual soil temperature of 72 degrees F.  Palapalai soils have strong structure in the A horizon and are weakly smeary and have a weak structure in the B horizon.  Waimea soils have weak structure or are massive throughout the B horizon and lack a buried B horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Kula soils are on uplands.  Slope is 4 to 40 percent.  Rock outcrop is common on ridges.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 feet.  The soils formed in volcanic ash over weathered andesite and basalt.  Annual rainfall is 25 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F.; average January temperature is 64 degrees F.; average July temperature is 68 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kaipoioi, Pane and Kamaole soils.  Kaipoioi soils have an umbric epipedon and mean annual soil temperature of 56 degrees F.  Pane soils have an umbric epipedon and are weakly smeary throughout the solum.  Kamaole soils have a fragmental control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for production of vegetable crops, flowers and pasture.  The natural vegetation is mainly bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), black wattle (Acacia decurrens), joee (Verbena litoralis), Natal redtop (Tricholaena repens), rattailgrass (Sporobolus capensis) and yellow toxtail (Setaria geniculata).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Island of Maui, Maui County, Hawaii.  This series is approximately 8,800 acres in extent.
