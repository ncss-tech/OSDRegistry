KERRICK SERIES

The Kerrick series consists of well drained, moderately permeable soils that are moderately deep over an indurated caliche layer.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy eolian deposits of Pleistocene age over indurated caliche of Pliocene age.  They occur on nearly level to gently sloping eolian plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (19.5 inches), and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Petrocalcic Calciustolls

    2Bkk1--97 to 122 cm (38 to 48 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gravelly loam; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable; about 30 percent petrocalcic fragments up to 4 cm across; about 60 percent by volume of calcium carbonates as masses, nodules, and finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (13 to 76 cm thick)

    2Bkk2--122 to 203 cm (48 to 80 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable; about 10 percent petrocalcic fragments up to 2 cm across; about 40 percent by volume of calcium carbonates as masses, nodules, and finely disseminated carbonates; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

Potter series: have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and soil temperatures more than 15 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the similar Plack series and the Conlen, Oslo, Potter, Sunray, and Texline series.
Plack soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Oslo, Sunray, and Texline soils: are on similar landscape positions and have an argillic horizon.
Conlen soils: are on similar landscape positions and have carbonatic mineralogy.
Plack soils: are on similar landscape positions.
Potter soils: are on slightly lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained and moderate permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Primarily used for livestock grazing.  Where cultivated, the principal crops are grain sorghum, small grains, and forage crops.  Native vegetation consists of buffalograss, blue grama and sideoats grama.  This soil has been correlated to the Limey Upland (R-077AY006TX) ecological site in MLRA-77A.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Northern Part (MLRA 77A in LRR H) north of the Canadian River in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.  The series is of minor extent.
