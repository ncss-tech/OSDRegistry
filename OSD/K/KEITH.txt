KEITH SERIES

The Keith series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in calcareous loess. Keith soils are on upland hillslopes, tableland plains, and valley terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C (52 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Keith silt loam, on a 1 percent slope, in a cultivated field (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES:
Aliante soils have a drier moisture control section in late spring and early summer.

Calemore soils have identifiable secondary carbonates within 10 to 38 centimeters (4 to 15 inches) of the mineral soil surface.
Hugoton soils have the top of the C horizons greater than 203 centimeters (80 inches) below mineral soil surface.
Kadoka soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: derived from loess
Landform: hills, plains, and stream terraces 
Slopes: 0 to 6 percent

Mean annual air temperature: 8 to 13 degrees C  (46 to 55 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 51 centimeters (14 to 20 inches)
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Richfield, Ulysses, Goshen, Kuma, Lodgepole, and Tripp soils. Richfield soils are in the fine family and on similar positions.  Ulysses soils do not have an argillic horizon and are higher on the landscape. Goshen soils formed in silty alluvium and are commonly lower in the landscape. Kuma soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 51 centimeters (20 inches) and are commonly lower in the landscape. Lodgepole soils are in the fine family and in depressions. Tripp soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high
Runoff: ranges from low on the nearly level slopes to high on moderately steep slopes 

USE AND VEGETATION: About 80 percent of the acreage of these soils is in cultivated cropland and 20 percent is principally native range. The main crops under dryland farming are alfalfa, grain sorghum, millet, and winter wheat. The dominant grasses on native range are blue grama, buffalograss, little bluestem, needleandthread, threadleaf sedge, and western wheatgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Nebraska, northwestern Kansas, and southwestern South Dakota, eastern Wyoming, and northeastern Colorado in MLRAs 67 and 72. The acreage is of large extent.
