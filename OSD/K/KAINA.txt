KAINA SERIES

The Kaina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that form in colluvium and till derived from mixed metasedimentary rock. These soils occur on cirque platforms, cirque headwalls, glacial-valley walls and moraines.  Slopes are 30 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,475 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid Typic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Kaina extremely gravelly sandy loam, in coniferous forest. This pedon described on a 45 percent slope at 1,817 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     Oi--0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed organic litter. 

     A--4 to 14 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 70 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones and 1 percent boulders; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary.

     C--14 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones and 1 percent boulders; moderately acid (pH 5.6).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained and 10 to 50 um/sec.

USE AND VEGETATION: Kaina soils are used mainly for recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is dominated by beardtongue, silverleaf phacelia, mountain agoseris, columbine, rockcress, Scouler's St. Johnswort, shortstalked sedge and dwarf fireweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kaina soils are of moderate extent in northwestern Montana. MLRA 43A and 43B.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Glacier National Park area in Glacier County, Montana, 2015. The series name is derived from a local landmark.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon -- from 0 to 14 cm (Oi, A horizons)
Particle-size control section -- from 29 to 104 cm (part of the C horizon).

Kaina soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic moisture regime.
