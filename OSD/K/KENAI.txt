COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cohoe, Mutnala, Naptowne, Whitsol series. Cohoe, Naptowne, Mutnala, and Whitsol soils have less than 20 percent clay in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well
Parent material: ash influenced loess over clayey till
Landform: moraines on till plains
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 40 degrees
Mean annual precipitation: 18 to 25 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and moderately low to moderately high in the till.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly in forest consisting of white spruce and paper birch with some quaking aspen and cottonwood. Some areas are cleared and used for grasses, potatoes, and other vegetables.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands South-central Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
