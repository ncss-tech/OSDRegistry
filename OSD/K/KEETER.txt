KEETER SERIES

The Keeter series consists of moderately deep over noncemented sandstone bedrock, well drained, moderately slowly permeable, loamy soils that formed in loamy residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone bedrock of Cretaceous age. These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils occur on crests of ridges on hills. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wise County, Texas; 1984. The name "Keeter" comes from the Keeter community in southeastern Wise County, Texas.

REMARKS:
These soils were formerly included in the Windthorst series.
Depth to root restriction changed from very deep to moderately deep based on field observations. Added soil moisture statements developed using the Java Newhall Simulation Model to the range in characteristics. Added similar climatic statements to geographic setting. Removed references to weakly cemented sandstone in favor of noncemented sandstone.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 18 to 68 cm (7 to 27 in) (Bt horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in) (A and E horizons)
Argillic horizon: 18 to 71 cm (7 to 28 in) (Bt horizons)
Albic materials: 18 to 38 cm (7 to 15 in) (Bt1 horizon)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 58 to 104 cm (23 to 41 in) (Bt3, BC, and Cd1 horizons)
Densic contact: top of sandstone bedrock at 84 cm (33 in) (top of Cd1 horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by KSSL sample number 78P0389 from Erath County, Texas.
