KAINTUCK SERIES 

The Kaintuck series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed ln loamy alluvium on flood plains. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Udifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kaintuck fine sandy loam on a convex slope of 1 percent in a pasture at an elevation of 810 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak very fine granular structure; very friable; many very fine and fine roots; many fine pores; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick) 

    C1--6 to 14 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; massive; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; many fine pores; 1 percent sandstone gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. 

    C2--14 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; massive; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; many fine pores; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    C3--22 to 33 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam; massive; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; many fine pores; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    C4--33 to 44 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; massive; very friable; common  very fine and few fine roots; many fine pores; 1 percent sandstone gravel; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

    C5--44 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam; massive; very friable; few very fine roots; common fine pores; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Phelps County, Missouri; near Meramec springs: 1,350 feet north and 380 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 33, T. 38 N., R. 6 W; USGS Meramec Springs, Missouri quadrangle, latitude 37 degrees 58 minutes 1.0 seconds N. and longitude 91 degrees 35 minutes 52.2 seconds W.; UTM zone 15, NAD 83, UTM 623,164 easting and 4,203,076 northing. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In the upper 40 inches, rock fragment content by volume ranges from 0 to 35 percent for the 2mm to 3 inch size and from 0 to 5 percent for the larger than 3 inch size . Below 40 inches, rock fragment content by volume averages 0 to 35 percent gravel and from 0 to 10 percent cobbles, but individual horizons may contain more. The soil ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline. 

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.

The C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is stratified loamy fine sand, sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, loamy sand or their gravelly analogues. Very gravelly analogues may be present below a depth of 40 inches. 

Buried A horizons are present in some places. 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kaintuck soils are on nearly level and gently sloping flood plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 46 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Midco, Razort and Relfe soils. Midco and Relfe soils are loamy-skeletal and are on similar positions. Razort soils are fine-loamy and are on terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff; moderately rapid permeability. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.  Kaintuck soils are subject to occasional to frequent flooding for very brief or brief durations. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have been cleared.  They are cropped to corn, sorghum, or soybeans or are used for hay or pasture. The remaining areas are in hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Ozarks Highlands region (MLRA 116A) of Missouri. The series is moderately extensive.
