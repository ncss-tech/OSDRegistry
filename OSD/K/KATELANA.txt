KATELANA SERIES

The Katelana series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone over lacustrine sediments.  The Katelana soils are on lake plains, lagoons, alluvial flats and lower margins of fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Katelana soils are on lake plains, lagoons, alluvial flats and lower fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone over calcareous lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,560 to 2,050 meters.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with warm, dry summers and cold, winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lusetti, Raph and Sheffit series.  Lusetti and Raph soils lack appreciable salinity or alkalinity in the profile, and lack carbonatic mineralogy.  Lusetti soils are in a coarse-loamy family.  Raph soils are in a fine-loamy family and have cambic horizons.  Sheffit soils are in a fine family and lack carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, shadscale, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28B.
