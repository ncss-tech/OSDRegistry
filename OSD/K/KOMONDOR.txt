KOMONDOR SERIES

The Komondor series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed dominantly in alluvium from basalt. Komondor soils are on lava plains. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F .

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Komondor loam --on a level lava plain at 5,360 feet elevation in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on September, 1994 the soil was dry throughout.)

	A1--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary.( 1 to 4 inches thick)

	A2--2 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.1); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

	Bt--5 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam (10YR 3/3) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy
boundary. (4 to 14 inches thick)

	Bk1--10 to 17 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silty clay loam (10YR 5/2) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine regular pores; strongly effervescent (21 percent calcium carbonate); few lime veins; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

	Bk2--17 to 32 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent (28 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); many lime veins and coatings on all sides of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 18 inches thick)

	Bk3--32 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; weak fine subangular block structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent (2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); many lime veins and coatings on all sides of rock fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1 ).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bancroft and Thatcher series. Bancroft soils have depth to the calcic horizon of 19 to 40 inches. Thatcher soils have 7.5YR and 5YR colors in the lower horizons and the depth to the calcic horizon is below 16 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform: lava plains
Elevation: 5,000 to 6,000 feet
Slope: 0 to 12 percent
Parent material: alluvium from basalt
Climate: long, cool winters; moist springs, and dry, warm summers.
Average annual precipitation: 12 to 14 inches
Average annual temperature: 41 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pyrenees and Vickton series. Pyrenees soils are moderately deep to basalt and lack argillic horizons. Vickton soils are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland. The principle native vegetation is three-tip sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Idaho. This series is of small extent.
