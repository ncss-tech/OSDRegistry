KAIAR SERIES

The Kaiar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sands and slope alluvium from calcareous sandstone and limestone.  Kaiar soils are on structural benches and mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Emery County, Utah, Emery Area, Utah, Parts of Emery, Carbon, Grand, and Sevier Counties, 2011.  Named for Paiute woman photographed by John Hillers of the 1872 Powell expedition. The pronunciation is KYE-ar. Prior to 2010 Kaiar soils were included in the ThumbRock series.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 88 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 88 cm.  (part of Bw, entire Bk and BCk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 30 cm.  (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 30 to 70 cm.  (Bk and BCk horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with sandstone bedrock at 88 cm.  (R horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
