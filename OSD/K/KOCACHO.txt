REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 33 to 108 cm
*Ochric epipedon
Redoximorphic features are generally not visible in the coarse parent material; classified as a somewhat poorly drained soil due to observed water tables and as evidenced by wetland vegetation.
Combined A and AC horizons do not meet criteria for mollic epipedons after mixing the upper 18 cm of mineral soil.
