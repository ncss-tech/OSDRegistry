KEG SERIES

The Keg series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium.  The Keg soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Keg silt loam, on a nearly level flood plain, about 1 percent slope, in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 291 meters above sea level.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 49 centimeters.)

 Bw--28 to 56 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (18 to 30 centimeters thick)

Matrix chroma of 2 in the cambic horizon is not considered pedogenic and is thought to be the color derived from the parent material. These colors were not considered in the classification of this series.
