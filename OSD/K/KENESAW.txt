KENESAW SERIES

The Kenesaw series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in recent loess on hummocky uplands.  Slopes typically range from 0 to 5 percent, but range up to 11 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 58 centimeters (23 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kenesaw silt loam with a slope of less than 1 percent, in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard; very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (18 to 36 centimeters (7 to 14 inches) thick)

   Bw--20 to 56 centimeters (8 to 22 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard; very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 41 centimeters (5 to 16 inches) thick)

   C--56 to 152 centimeters (22 to 60 inches); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard; very friable; slightly alkaline; strong effervescence.

TYPE LOCATION:  Buffalo County, Nebraska; about 20.8 kilometer (13 miles) north of Shelton, Nebraska; 46 meters (150 feet) north and 46 meters (150 feet) east of the southwest corner, sec. 25, T. 12 N., R. 13 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Solum thickness: 30 to 66 centimeters (12 to 26 inches)  
Depth to carbonates: 25 to 91 centimeters (10 to 36 inches) typically 38 to 71 centimeters (15 to 28 inches)

A horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: silt loam, but includes loam and very fine sandy loam  
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

Bw horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, ranging to silt loam and very fine sandy loam
Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.

Some pedons have a BC horizon.
C horizon
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam, loam and very fine sandy loam.  In places, thin wind stratification is common and includes material ranging from loam to sand.  
Redoximorphic features: Reddish or brownish mottles are in the C horizon of some pedons, but are not related to a present water table  
Reaction:     mildly   alkaline or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cozad and Lowry series. 
Cozad soils are on stream terraces and formed in silty alluvium.
Lowry soils are typically shallower to free carbonates.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loess 
Landform: nearly level or low hummocky poorly developed drainage on uplands 
Slope: 0 to 11 percent but typically are 0 to 7 percent  
Climate: subhumid  
Mean annual precipitation: 48 to 61 centimeters (19 to 24 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 11 degrees C. (49 to 52 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coly, Gates, Hersh, Holdrege, Ortello, Rusco, Thurman, and Valentine soils.  
Coly soils are fine-silty, lack a mollic epipedon, and are in side slopes to drainageways.  
Gates soils are slightly higher in the landscape.  
Hersh soils are coarse-loamy, lack a mollic epipedon, and are higher than Kenesaw soils.  
Holdrege soils are fine-silty, have an argillic horizon, and are on tablelands and side slopes to drainageways. 
Ortello soils are coarse-loamy.  
Rusco soils have an argillic horizon and are not as well drained.  
Thurman and Valentine soils have a sandy control section and are commonly on hummocky landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: Well drained
Runoff: low or medium.  
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acre is cultivated.  Some areas are irrigated.
The main crops are corn, grain sorghum, alfalfa, and winter wheat.  
Native grasses are big bluestem, little bluestem, sideoats grama, blue grama, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Located in south-central Nebraska and northeastern Kansas.  These soils are extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hall County, Nebraska, 1959.

REMARKS:

10/03/02 PRF Reformatted the OSD.  The soil is an upland loess derived soil, therefore stream terrace was removed from the geomorphic location.

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
