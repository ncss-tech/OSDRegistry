KNOCO SERIES

The Knoco series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from claystone over dense noncemented claystone bedrock of Permian age. These very gently sloping to very steep soils occur on interfluves, side slopes and erosional footslopes on dissected plains. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).
