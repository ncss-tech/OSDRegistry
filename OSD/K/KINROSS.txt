KINROSS SERIES 

The Kinross series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial material on outwash plains, stream terraces, lake plains, kame, disintegration and ground moraines.  Permeability is rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Endoaquods 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kinross muck - on a nearly level forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   Oa--0 to 6 inches; black (5YR 2/1) muck; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick) 

   E--6 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand; few fine faint dark gray (10YR 4/1) mottles; single grain; loose; many fine roots; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 inches thick) 

   Bhs--10 to 12 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) sand; single grain; loose; common fine roots; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 9 inches thick) 

   Bs--12 to 24 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) sand; few medium faint dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) mottles; single grain; loose; few fine roots; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 inches thick) 

   BC--24 to 42 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sand; single grain; loose; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick) 

   C--42 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; strongly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Delta County, Michigan; about 10 miles west and 5 miles south of Steuben; 495 feet north and 500 feet west of the center of sec. 15, T. 43 N., R. 19 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 16 to 55 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. 

The O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma to 0 or 2. It is muck or mucky peat. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid. 

Some pedons have A horizons 1 to 6 inches thick that have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 1 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are mucky sand, mucky fine sand, mucky loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.  Where present the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A and Ap horizons have reactions that are extremely acid or very strongly acid. 

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 5Y, and 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand. Mottling is faint or distinct. The organic matter content of the upper 10 inches of soil (Oa and E horizons) is less than 12 percent. Reaction of the E horizon is extremely acid or very strongly acid. 

The Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sand, fine sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid. 

The Bs has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; and value and chroma of 3 to 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together in the horizon.  Mottling is faint or there is none in the E horizons, but it is always in the upper part of the Bhs horizon. In some pedons there is a Bs horizon above the Bhs horizon.  The Bs horizons are sand, fine sand, or loamy sand. Reaction ranges form extremely acid to moderately acid. 

The BC horizon has hue of  5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. 

The C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.  In some pedons this horizon is prominently mottled and in other pedons there is no mottling.  Strata of coarse sand or fine gravel occur in the C horizon of some pedons. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Au Gres, Battlefield and Wainola and Wormet series. All of these soils are saturated for a period of 70 to 90 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. In addition Battlefield soils are underlain by gravelly sand and have carbonates within 40 inches.  The Wormet soils have a loamy textured cap 10 to 20 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kinross soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, stream terraces, kame, disintegration and ground moraines.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 34 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Au Gres, Croswell, Dawson, Kalkaska, and Rubicon soils.  Au Gres soils are somewhat poorly drained; Croswell soils are moderately well drained; Kalkaska soils are somewhat excessively drained, and Rubicon soils are excessively drained.  Dawson soils are shallow organic soils overlying sands. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained and very poorly drained The representative depth to wet soil moisture status is at the surface to one foot below the surface at times during the period from October to June.  The representative depth of ponding is from 0.2 to 0.5 foot at some time during the period from October to June.  The soil is saturated for a period of 90 to 120 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C.  Runoff is negligible.  Permeability is rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is in woodland or brush.  Black spruce, tamarack, northern whitecedar, balsam fir, red maple, and quaking aspen are the principal tree species.  Ground cover includes water tolerant grasses and sedges, leatherleaf, sphagnum, and bog rosemary. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northern Wisconsin.  The series is of small extent.
