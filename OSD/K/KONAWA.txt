KONAWA SERIES

The Konawa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age  They are on treads and risers of low stream terraces in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 914 mm (36 in) and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Ultic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Konawa fine sandy loam in a bermudagrass pasture, at an elevation of 284 m (930 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated)

  Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); brown (7.5YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 25 cm [4 to 10 in])

  E--23 to 43 cm (9 to 17 in); light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the E horizon is 0 to 43 cm [0 to 17 in])

  Bt--43 to 135 cm (17 to 53 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable; few faint clay films on peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 91 cm [10 to 36 in])

  BC--135 to 183 (53 to 72 in); red (2.5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable; neutral.

Runoff: negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 20 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are mainly cultivated to small grain, sorghum, and peanuts. Some areas are used for tame pasture or range. Native vegetation is mainly post oak, blackjack oak, and hickory with an understory of grasses   

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  LRR J; North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A) of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas. The series is extensive.
