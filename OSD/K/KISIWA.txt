KISIWA SERIES 


The Kisiwa series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils formed in slight depressions in clayey or loamy, calcareous alluvium on terraces and on floodplains in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Reno County, Kansas, 1990. The name is from Kisiwa Creek. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 7 inches (0 to 18 centimeters). (Ap1, Ap2), These horizons have OC >0.6% and are greater than 1/3 the thickness from surface to secondary carbonates.
natric horizon: The zone from 7 to 52 inches (18 to 132 centimeters). 
(Btkn, Btknssg1, Btknssg2, Btknssg3, Btknssg4, Btkg)
Water table: The presence of a perched water table from 1.5 to 2 feet (0.4 to 0.6 meters) during the months of Dec. - Oct.

KISIWA SERIES
LRR=H
3/90 This series is being put in OSED for the first time.
6/14/95: Corrected taxonomy on SIR and OSED PRF
12/23/99: series proposed in 1990 and established in 1999.
11/2003, WAW:  Changed classification to fine from fine-loamy and from alfisol to mollisol.  The original concept of the series was in the fine textural family.  The lab data for the type location (90KS155008) was 34% carbonate free clay on a weighted average and 36% clay total weighted average.  In addition, there are several horizons with greater than 40% clay total.  Based on this information we are updating the classification and competing series.  The 8 inches of mollic colors is more than 1/3 of the depth to pedogenic carbonates and qualifies as thick enough for a mollic epipedon.
