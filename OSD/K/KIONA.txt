SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Benton County, Washington; 1971

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--zone from 10 to 51 cm
*Carbonate accumulation--zone from 51 to 150 cm; 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

Many of the rock fragments have a violently effervescent coating of lime on one side. Because of colluvial movement, the orientation of the coated side is not consistent.
