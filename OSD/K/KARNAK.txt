REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 cm (5 inches) (Ap horizon)
cambic horizon--the zone from 13 to 127 cm (5 to 50 inches) (Bg horizons)
aquic moisture regime

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Vertic subgroup based on linear extensibility greater than 6.0 cm between the surface and a depth of 100 cm
The 03/2015 revision converted to a semi-tabular format, expanded the Range in Characteristics to include reaction through slightly alkaline in the B horizons, and expanded the range of texture in the B horizon to include silty clay loam.  The pedon description was updated to convert mottles to appropriate redoximorphic features.
