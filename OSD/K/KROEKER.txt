KROEKER SERIES

The Kroeker series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium and/or eolian deposits of Holocene age over the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age. These soils occur on very gently sloping to moderately sloping treads of terraces and terrace remnants and on hillslopes of the dissected high plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 14.4 degrees C (58 degrees F).

SERIES PROPOSED:  Beaver County, Oklahoma, 2008

REMARKS: 
Many pedons, as the one in this description, have argillic horizons between 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in) that have been engulfed and destroyed by accumulation of carbonates.
Lab data from the type location shows this pedon to be just barely in the fine-silty textural family. Other data suggests that most pedons of this series classify in the fine-loamy textural family. More data should be collected to determine which textural family the majority of the series classifies in.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon:
  Particle-size control section: 19 to 58 cm (8 to 23_in)
  Mollic epipedon: 0 to 19 cm (0 to 8 in) (Ap horizon)
  Argillic horizon: 19 to 58 cm (8 to 23 in) (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons)
  Calcic horizon: 58 to 115 cm (23 to 45 in) (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
  Identifiable secondary carbonates: 19 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in) (Btk, Bk, and BCk horizons)
