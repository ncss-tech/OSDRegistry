KALKASKA SERIES

The Kalkaska series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy drift on outwash plains, valley trains, moraines, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, frigid Typic Haplorthods

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adams, Cusino, Duxbury, Fishcreek (T), Liminga, Pence, and Stutts series. Adams, Duxbury, and Fishcreek soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during the month of August. Cusino soils average more than 10 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Liminga soils have more than 50 percent fine sand in the sand fraction throughout the series control section. Pence soils have a loamy mantle 25 to 50 centimeters thick and average more than 10 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. Stutts soils have a combined content of silt plus clay greater than 15 percent in the upper part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kalkaska soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, moraines, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Kalkaska soils formed in sandy drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 680 to 920 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees C. Frost-free period is 90 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Au Gres, Deford, East Lake, Halfaday, Roscommon, and Rubicon soils. The moderately well drained Halfaday, somewhat poorly drained Au Gres, and poorly and very poorly drained Deford soils form a common drainage sequence with the Kalkaska soils. The somewhat excessively drained East Lake and poorly and very poorly drained Roscommon soils are common associates on outwash plains. The East Lake soils are on similar landform positions, have more than 10 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section and have moist colors of value or chroma greater than 3 in the upper part of the spodic horizon. Roscommon soils are in depressions and do not have a spodic horizon. The excessively drained Rubicon soils are common associates on moraines. Rubicon soils are on similar landform positions and have moist colors of value or chroma greater than 3 in the upper part of the spodic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: The majority of this soil is forested. Some areas are idle cropland or in pasture. A small portion of this soil is cultivated with small grains, hay, and potatoes being the principle crops. Native vegetation is intermixed hardwoods and conifers, predominantly sugar maple, American beech, red pine, quaking aspen, bigtooth aspen, and eastern white pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 93B, 94A, 94B, 94C, and 96 in the northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and northern Wisconsin. The type location is in MLRA 94A. These soils are extensive, with about 982,000 acres of the series mapped.
