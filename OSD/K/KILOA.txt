KILOA SERIES

The Kiloa series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in organic material overlying `a`a lava.  Kiloa soils are on the slopes of Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is 4000 millimeters (160 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, isothermic Typic Udifolists

TYPICAL PEDON: Kiloa extremely stony highly decomposed plant material under ohia lehua/guava forest on a 3 percent slope at an elevation of 572 meters (1,880 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  When described soil was moist throughout.  All textures are apparent field textures.  pH was measured using organic dyes.

    2C1/Oa--0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches); very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2) extremely cobbly highly decomposed plant material; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, non sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many  interstitial pores; 25 percent subangular `a`a gravel, 30 percent subangular `a`a cobble and 5 percent subangular `a`a stone, non smeary; many roots, many pores; strongly acid (pH 5.2); .) The 2C part of this horizon consist of unconsolidated `a`a lava fragments of variable size.abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 30 centimeters (3 to 12 inches) thick)

    2C2--25 to 128 centimeters (10 to 50 inches); fragmental `a`a lava with a small amount of material from above in spaces between rocks; 20 percent subangular `a`a stone, 45 percent subangular `a`a cobble 30 percent subangular `a`a gravel.

TYPE LOCATION: Hawaii County, Hawaii; from Highway 11 turn southwest on Stainback Highway and proceed 15 miles and park; proceed south approximately 30 feet of highway to type location Kulani Quadrangle; 19 degrees 33 minutes 47.32 seconds North latitude and 155 degrees 16 minutes 21.26 seconds West longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to bedrock: 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches).
Mean annual soil temperature: 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 72 degrees F).
Rock fragments: 65 to 90 percent by volume of the pedon and range from gravel to cobble size `a`a lava rocks.
Soil moisture: The soil is typically moist throughout the profile. Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months of normal years (perudic soil moisture regime).

Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR

Rock fragments: 85 to 95 percent `a`a lava

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Puna series. Puna soils are located on the leeward side of Island of Hawaii and receive the majority of rainfall from April to October.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kiloa soils are on Mauna Loa lava and Kilauea flows 250 to 1,000 years old at elevations of 366 to 1,372 meters (1,200 to 4,500 feet). Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of organic material and volcanic ash overlying `a`a lava. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 2,286 to 4000 millimeters (90 to more than 160 inches) with most of the rainfall occurring from October to May. Mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 762 to 1,016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches).  Annual temperatures average from 17 to 22 degrees C (63 to 71 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Kopua, Makaala, Waiakea, Keei and Ihope series.  Kopua series is a mineral soil.  Makaala soils are moderately deep. Waiakea soils have silty clay loam textures.  Keei soils are shallow.  Ihope soils are somewhat poorly drained and have redoximorphic features.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is low. Permeability is very rapid in the soil and very slow in the underlying bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used principally for pasture and woodland. Natural vegetation is ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), treefern (Cibotium spp.), sedge (Carex spp.) and kikuyugrass (Pennisetum clandestinum).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Island of Hawaii. MLRA 162. This series is moderately extensive with approximately 13,500 acres.
