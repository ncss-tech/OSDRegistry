KNOTMER SERIES

The Knotmer series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from volcanic rock and tephra over residuum derived from basalt. They are in deflation basins on lava plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Mollic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Knotmer very stony ashy sandy loam; rangeland, on a 2 percent northeast-facing slope at 4572 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  All textures are apparent field textures)

( 0 to 4 inches thick)

 2R--6 to 16 inches; indurated basalt bedrock, fractured at intervals of 18 to 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Knotmer soils are in deflation basins on lava plateaus.  Elevations range from 4,450 to 5,500 feet. The soils formed eolian deposits derived from volcanic rock and tephra over residuum derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The average annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Merlin, Yancy, and Maset soils.  Merlin soils are on lava plateaus and are 10 to 20 inches deep to lithic basalt.  Yancy soils are on alluvial fans and are 10 to 20 inches deep to a duripan.  Maset soils are on air fall tephra fields and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Knotmer soils are used mainly for limited livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The soils commonly support low sage, Sandberg bluegrass rock buckwheat, Sandberg bluegrass, and bigseed biscuitroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Oregon; MLRA 21. The series is inextensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES PROPOSED: Klamath County, Oregon, 2006 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: 
Ochric epipedon 
Argillic horizon - The zone from 4 to 6 inches
Lithic contact - The contact at 6 inches
Particle-size control section - The zone from the surface to 6 inches (A, AB, and Bt horizons).  Weighted average rock fragment content is 29 percent.

Need to verify ashy or loamy placement in family.  Need glass count in the A and AB horizons.  If over 30 percent, then family is ashy not loamy.
