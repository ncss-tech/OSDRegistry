TYPE LOCATION: Gulkana River Area, Alaska; about 20 miles north Sourdough; the SE1/4 of the SE1/4 of section 19, T.12 N., R.2 W., Copper River Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: 32 to 35 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 36 to 39 degrees F. (2 to 4 degrees C)
Upper part of the control section: stratified sand through silt with composite texture of fine sandy loam or sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser
Lower part of the control section: 40 to 75 percent total coarse fragments
Depth to sand and gravel: 12 to 40 inches

Oi/A horizon: (where present)
Color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 or 3
Texture: mixed slightly decomposed plant material and fine sandy loam
Reaction: extremely acid or very strongly acid

A/Oe horizon: (where present)
Color: value of 2 or 3; chroma of 2 or 3
Texture: mixed silt loam and moderately decomposed plant material
Rock fragments: 0 to 2 percent rounded gravel
Reaction: very strongly acid to strongly acid

A or AC horizons: (where present)
Color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 1 to 3.
Texture: very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam, finely stratified in many pedons
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

C horizons:
Color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 or 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Redoximorphic features (where present): few or common
Redoximorphic concentrations: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma of 4 or 6
Redoximorphic depletions: hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; chroma of 1 or 2
Dark colors: due to the high concentration of black sand grains
Texture: stratified sand through silt with composite texture of sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

2C horizon:
Color: variegated or hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: sand or coarse sand modified by 40 to 75 percent coarse fragments, 25 to 65 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobble
Reaction: slightly acid to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jarvis, Klutina, Niklason, Portdick, and Tonowek series. Jarvis soils have substantial mica content. Klutina soils have calcareous substratum. Niklason soils have a presumed warmer mean annual soil temperature. Portdick and Tonowek soils have mean annual soil temperatures warmer than 36 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: stratified sandy and silty alluvium over sand and gravel
Landform: low stream terraces and floodplains
Slopes: 0 to 12 percent
Climate: subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers
Mean annual temperature: about 26 degrees F.
Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F.
Mean July temperature is 56 degrees F.
Mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches 
Mean annual precipitation: about 16 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained or well drained, run off is very low or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the upper part and high to very in the gravelly substratum. These soils are subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Most areas have native vegetation of white spruce forest or balsam poplar forest with an understory of willows and alder. Vegetation patterns reflect flooding frequency.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Copper River Basin, Alaska.  The series is of moderate extent.
