KENRAY SERIES

The Kenray series consists of deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sediments derived from sandstone.  Kenray soils are on dunes and mesas.  Slope is 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Typic Ustipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kenray fine sand--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    A2--5 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 18 inches thick)

    C1--15 to 32 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common fine irregular pores; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 35 inches thick)

    C2--32 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; neutral.  (25 to 40 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Cibola County, New Mexico; about 20 miles south of Grants; 1,740 feet west and 360 feet north of the southeast corner of section 2, T. 7 N., R. 10 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section periodically during May and June; moist in some part, periodically, from July through October. Typic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  45 to 47 degrees F.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  3 through 6, dry or moist
Texture:  sand, fine sand, loamy sand

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beisigl (ND), Blanchard (MT), Seroco (ND), Yecross (SD) and Zilditloi (AZ) series.  Beisigl soils have a paralithic contact at depths between 20 to 40 inches.  Blanchard and Yecross soils are calcareous.  Seroco soils are moist in some or all parts of the soil moisture control section during May and June. Zilditloi soils have soil temperatures of 42 to 45 degrees F. and are moist in the soil moisture control section during May.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kenray soils are formed in eolian sediments on dunes and mesas.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 7,300 to 8,000 feet.  The peak period of precipitation is from July to October.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pinitos, Ribera and Stout series.  Pinitos and Ribera soils have argillic horizons and Stout soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for wood products and livestock grazing.  Present native vegetation is ponderosa pine with scattered grasses and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is of small extent in west central New Mexico. MLRAs 35 & 39.
