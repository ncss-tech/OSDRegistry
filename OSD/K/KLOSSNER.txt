KLOSSNER SERIES

The Klossner series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in well decomposed organic material  overlying loamy or silty lacustrine deposits, slope alluvium, or till. These soils are depressions on moraines, till plains, lake plains, flood plains, and seeps. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 585 to 930 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, euic, mesic Terric Haplosaprists 

TYPICAL PEDON: Klossner muck, on a 1 percent slope, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oa--25 to 66 cm; black (10YR 2/1) muck, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; about 60 percent fiber, about 6 percent rubbed; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; many very fine roots; pH 5.8 (moderately acid); gradual smooth boundary.

 2Cg1--122 to 165 cm; olive gray (5Y 5/2) clay loam; massive; friable; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) iron concentrations in root channels; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron concentrations; 1 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; pH 7.6 (slightly alkaline); gradual wavy boundary. 

 2Cg2--165 to 200 cm; gray (5Y 5/1) loam; massive; friable; many medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) iron concentrations; 3 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; pH 7.6 (slightly alkaline).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blue Earth, Canisteo, Essexville, and Harps soils. 
Blue Earth--formed in mucky silt loam
Canisteo--are on the rims of depressions
Essexville--are on the edges of depressions and on sandbars
Harps--are on the rims of depressions

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--very poorly drained--these soils are frequently ponded 30 to 90 centimeters above the surface during the wettest period of normal years in natural conditions.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--1.4 to 42.3 micrometers per second (high to very high) in the organic material and 0.4 to 14.1 micrometers per second (moderately low to moderately high) in the mineral material.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
When drained, these soils are cultivated. The main crops are corn, soybeans, small grains and specialty crops such as vegetables or grass sod. Reed canarygrass commonly dominates partially drained pasture. The native vegetation is herbaceous marsh species tolerant of excessive wetness such as, cattails, bulrushes, giant burreed, giant reed grass and hydrophytic sedges.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Nicollet County, Minnesota, 1989. 

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--The upper 30 centimeters of the mineral layer (2A and 2Cg horizons); 
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 200 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Sapric soil materials--the zone from the surface to a depth 66 centimeters;
reduced matrix--the zone from 122 to 203 centimeters. This concept is in the aquic moisture regime. 
Klossner was formerly included in the Palms Series in Minnesota. A firm till substratum phase of clay loam with a moist bulk density of 1.6 To 1.9 grams/cubic centimeter is recognized in the Kandiyohi till geomorphic surface.
