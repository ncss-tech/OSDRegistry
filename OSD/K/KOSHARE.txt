KOSHARE SERIES

The Koshare series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Koshare soils are on toeslopes of ridges, hills, and treads of fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

Ignacio soils are moderately deep to hard bedrock.  Ojito and Turnback soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock.  Parida and Sandspring soils have hues of 10YR.  In addition, Parida soils also have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Remmit soils have hues of 10YR and 2.5Y. In addition, Remmit and Turnback soils are in the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Koshare soils are on toeslopes of ridges and hills, and treads of fan remnants.  They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist and Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Ojito soil and the Innacutt, Quarteles, El Rancho, and Walkibout soils.  Innacutt soils do not have diagnostic horizons and occur on inset fans and narrow flood plains of gulches.  Ojito soils occur on adjacent beveled summits, shoulders, and footslopes.  Quarteles soils are loamy, very shallow to soft bedrock, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on adjacent backslopes.  El Rancho soils are fine-silty and occur on toeslopes of ridges and hills.  Walkibout soils are coarse-silty, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on side slopes of gulches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Koshare soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, irrigated cropland, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, sand dropseed, spike dropseed, galeta, black grama, Bigelow's rubber rabbitbrush.  The ecological site is Sandy (R036XB113NM). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Koshare soils are of moderate extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
