KRUSE SERIES

The Kruse series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, canyon sides, ridges and hills. They formed in residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, and mica schist with a mantle of mixed ash and loess. Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Slope ranges from 0 to 75 percent. The average annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 30 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kruse soils are on mountain slopes, canyon sides, ridges and hills. Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, or mica schist with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash at elevations of 1,600 to 4,700 feet (488 to 1433 meters). The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 43 inches (635 to 1092 mm). The average frost-free period is from 80 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ardtoo, Lenz, Melder, Ulricher, Vassar, and Blackprince soils. Ardtoo and Blackprince soils are on east and west-facing convex mountain slopes and do not have argillic horizons. Lenz and Ulricher soils are on south-facing mountain slopes and are mesic. Melder soils are on south-facing mountain footslopes, are loamy-skeletal, and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Vassar soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and have volcanic ash surface horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; Moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Some cleared areas are used for the production of small grains, grass seed, hay, and pasture. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine, ponderosa pine, western larch, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of myrtle pachystima, Columbia brome, American trailplant, baldhip rose, starry false-Solomon's-seal, sweetscented bedstraw, pine reedgrass, common snowberry, elk sedge, mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, and white spirea. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and eastern Washington. This soil is moderately extensive. MLRA 43.
