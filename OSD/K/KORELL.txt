KORELL SERIES

The Korell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluventic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Korell loam in irrigated cropland (colors are for dry soil unless noted otherwise). 

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--7 to 12 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizons is 7 to 15 inches) 

    Bw1--12 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and coarse angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime, strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bw2--24 to 34 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; disseminated lime, strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 7 to 20 inches thick) 

    BCk--34 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) stratified silt loam and loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; with few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) relict mottles; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; few fine seams and masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1258.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 12 inches (Ap and A2 horizons); 
Cambic horizon - from 12 to 24 inches (Bw horizon); 
Accumulation of lime - from 34 to 70 inches (BCk horizon);
