KANDRIX SERIES

The Kandrix series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sediments and alluvium derived from sedimentary deposits.  Kandrix soils are on plains, ridges, and hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kandrix loam, on a south facing, 3 percent slope in grass at an elevation of 5,290 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on April 5, 2002 the soil was dry throughout.

(4 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--6 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots throughout; violent effervescence (11 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

(Combined thickness of the Bk1, Bk2 and Bk3 horizons is 30 to 42 inches)

    Bk4--51 to 65 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine irregular carbonate masses in matrix; violent effervescence 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, Las Animas County soil survey area, Colorado.  The name is coined and taken from the town site of Andrix.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (parts of Bw, Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 14 inches.  (Bw horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 14 to 51 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)
Other features:  aridic ustic moisture regime.

Remarks:  This soil was originally included with the Kimst series but was separated due to consistent identifiable carbonates and the presence of a calcic horizon.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S03CO071002.
