KEEFER SERIES

The Keefer series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 630 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic Fluventic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Keefer stratified silt loam, located on a flood plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 49 meters; when described on July 3rd, 2009 the soil was wet from 120 to 183 cm (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 10 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and common coarse roots; moderately acid (pH 5.7)

 A--10 to 19 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) stratified silt loam; 40 percent sand; 53 percent silt; 7 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots, common medium roots, and common coarse roots; extremely acid (pH 4.4)

 AB--19 to 100 cm; 60 percent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stratified fine sandy loam; 60 percent sand; 37 percent silt; 3 percent clay; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots and common medium roots; 40 percent medium dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries; strongly acid (pH 5.2)

 Cg--100 to 183 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) stratified fine sandy loam; 55 percent sand; 43 percent silt; 2 percent clay; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderately acid (pH 5.6)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material - Grassy organic material over coarse-loamy alluvium
Landform - Flood plains
Slope - 0 to 1 percent
Elevation - 7 to 62 meters
Climate - Cool summers; cold winters, August and September are the wettest months
Mean annual precipitation - 609 to 648 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 0.5 to 0.7 degrees C
Frost free duration - 85 to 140 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Lewispoint - Moderately well drained; loamy alluvium; similar landform position
Ekwok - Well drained, loamy eolian deposits, plains
Tunravik - Well drained, eolian and alluvium, terraces

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: (Ksat)
Drainage class - Moderately well drained
Saturation in normal years - Occurs in a layer from 75 to 152 cm of the soil surface for more than two weeks during the growing season
Flooding - Occasional and brief
Ponding - None
Ksat - Moderately high to high throughout the mineral soil material, except high in the C horizon
Redoximorphic features in the upper part of the AB are a result of spring thaw conditions where water perches on top of hard frost.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Use - Wildlife habitat
Potential natural vegetation - Boreal woodland composed of white spruce with an understory of tealeaf willow, arctic raspberry, bluejoint grass, field horsetail, and Canadian burnet

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Bristol Bay Lowlands; MLRA 236; small extent
