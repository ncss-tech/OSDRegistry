KIMBERSON SERIES

The Kimberson series consists of soils that are very shallow or shallow, well drained, and moderately permeable above a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. These gravelly or cobbly soils formed in a thin mantle of calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age over indurated caliche of Pliocene age. These soils are on nearly level and very gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mmm (19 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

bushsunflower, gray goldaster, daleas, gayfeather, plains blackfoot, sundrops,

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 28 cm. (A horizons) 
Petrocalcic horizons: 28 to 71 cm (11 to 28 in) and 163 to 203 cm (64 to 80 in). (Bkkm and B'kkm horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 71 to 163 cm (28 to 64 in) (Bkk horizon) 
Plugged (kk) horizon: 28 to 203 cm (11 to 80 in) (Bkkm, Bkk, B'kkm horizon) 
Note: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure. 
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data from surrounding soils.
