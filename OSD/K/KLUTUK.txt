KLUTUK SERIES

The Klutuk series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian deposits on rises or talfs of plains and on hills. Slopes range from 0 to 43 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic Andic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Klutuk highly organic silt loam, located on a rise of a plain with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 54 meters; when described on August 2nd, 2006 the soil was moist throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)
