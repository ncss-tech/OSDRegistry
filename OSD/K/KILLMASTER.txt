KILLMASTER SERIES

The Killmaster series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Killmaster soils formed in till and are on ground moraines and drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Aquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Killmaster sandy loam, on a 2 percent slope in a cultivated area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; about 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

[2.5 to 15 cm (1 to 6 inches) thick]

 E/B--33 to 51 cm (13 to 20 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) loamy sand (E); occupies about 60 percent of the horizon surrounding peds of brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common distinct reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay films on faces of peds; few medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; about 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary.

 B/E--51 to 58 cm (20 to 23 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt); occupies about 70 percent of the horizon penetrated by tongues of brown (7.5YR 5/2) loamy sand (E); strong medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and medium roots; common distinct dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; common fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; about 5 percent grave and 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the E/B and B/E horizons is 13 to 38 cm (5 to 15 inches).]

 Bt--58 to 81 cm (23 to 32 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; few medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron; few fine distinct brown (7.5YR 5/2) iron depletions; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine and medium roots; common faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; about 5 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 28 cm (4 to 11 inches) thick]

 Cd--81 to 203 cm (32 to 80 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam; massive; weakly with expressed platiness inherited from the parent material; very firm; few medium distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) masses of oxidized iron along fracture planes; few patchy distinct pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) carbonate coatings along fracture planes; about 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Killmaster soils are on tops of drumlins and on ground moraines of Wisconsinan age. These soils are formed in till. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hoist and the Ensley soils. The moderately well drained Hoist soils are on sides of drumlins and sloping areas of ground moraines. The poorly drained Ensley soils are on lower positions in the landscape. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 91 cm (1 to 3 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is used for growing grains and hay. A small portion is in woodland. Tree species include balsam fir, paper birch, bigtooth aspen and white spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northeast quarter of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Alcona County, Michigan, 1992.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (8 inches) (Ap horizon)
Albic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 33 cm (8 to 13 inches) (E horizon).
Glossic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 58 cm (13 to 23 inches) (E/B and B/E horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 51 to 81 cm (20 to 32 inches) (Bt part of the B/E and Bt horizon).
Densic contact: at 81 cm (32 inches) (top of the Cd horizon).
Aquic conditions: iron depletions present in the glossic and argillic horizons.

The Killmaster soils were mapped as Solona series prior to 1988. They depart from the concept of Solona series by having a glossic horizon and by forming in dense basal till.
