KENILWORTH SERIES

The Kenilworth series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or in eolian and alluvial deposits over till, or over glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  The Kenilworth soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Toole County, Montana, 1991.  Series proposed in Chouteau County, Montana, 1986.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1080.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (Ap, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 5 to 16 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt horizons); horizon of lime accumulation from 16 to 29 inches (2Bk horizons).  Kenilworth soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
