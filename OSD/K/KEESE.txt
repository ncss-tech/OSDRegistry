KEESE SERIES 

The Keese series consists of well drained shallow soils to bedrock that formed in residuum weathered from granite, granite grus, or gneiss of pre-Cambrian age.  These gently sloping to steep soils are on shoulders, summits and backslopes of ridges and hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic, shallow Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Keese coarse sandy loam--native rangeland.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Spikebox series in the same family. Similar soils include the Cordell, Dugout, Nebgen, and Yates series.
Cordell soils: have a lithic contact with sandstone between 25 and 50 cm (10 and 20 in).
Dugout soils: have carbonatic mineralogy and are 30 to 50 cm (12 to 20 in) to lithic limestone bedrock.
Nebgen soils: are 10 to 36 cm (4 to 14 in) to lithic contact of sandstone bedrock and do not have a cambic horizon.
Spikebox soils: are 20 to 50 cm (8 to 20 in) to a paralithic contact with sandstone bedrock.
Yates soils: are 10 to 36 cm(4 to 14 in) to lithic contact with limestone, have no cambic horizon, and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Residuum weathered from granite, granite grus, or gneiss
Landscape: Dissected plain
Landform: Shoulders, summits and backslopes of ridges and hills
Slope: 1 to 30 percent, but dominantly 1 to 8 percent slopes
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly amount occurs during the fall and spring months. The winter and summer months are normally drier.
Mean annual precipitation: 635 to 813 mm (25 to 32 in)
Thornthwaite P-E index: 34 to 46
Mean annual air temperature: 17.8 to 19.4 degrees C (64 to 67 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 210 to 240 days
Elevation: 243.8 to 609.6 m (800 to 2,000 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Castell, Click, Katemcy, Ligon, Lou, and Voca series. 
All of these soils are greater than 50 cm (20 in) deep to bedrock.
Castell, Katemcy, and Voca soils: occur on footslopes of undulating plains, ridges and hills.
Click soils: occur on shoulders and summits of hills and ridges.
Lou soils: occur on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying bedrock. Runoff is medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes, high on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and very high on slopes greater than 20 percent. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used entirely for rangeland.  Native vegetation on better ranges is mostly little bluestem, purpletop, and sand lovegrass with scattered post oak and live oak trees.  The vegetation on poorer ranges is mostly Texas persimmon, ash, juniper, tasajillo, threeawn grass, and numerous forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas; Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region, LRR-I; MLRA 82A-Texas Central Basin. This series is of large extent with over 150,000 acres.
