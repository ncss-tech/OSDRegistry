KREZA SERIES

The Kreza series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale, slate, and schist with additions of calcareous eolian material.  Kreza soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kreza gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 30 percent gravel. 

    A--0 to 3 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine vesicular and few very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; 15 percent parachanners of schist; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt--3 to 13 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel; 15 percent parachanners of schist; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    R--13 cm; hard schist, fractured and weathered in upper 5 to 10 cm with roots and secondary carbonate coats lining fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; near Cottonwood Basin of the Fox Range in an unsurveyed area 1000 feet east and 200 feet west of the southwest corner of section 9 T. 31 N., T. 22 E; USGS Smith Canyon 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 34 minutes 02.9 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 31 minutes 0.2 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.5674722 latitude, -119.516722 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist winter and spring, dry mid June through mid-November; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C.
Ochric epipedon thickness: 3 to 10 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 10 to 25 cm to a lithic contact.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  15 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments:  15 to 35 percent hard gravel and 15 to 30 percent parachanners.  Lithology of fragments is metamorphic rocks such as schist.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.

Bt horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry.
Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.
Clay content:  18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent gravel.
Pararock fragments: 15 to 30 percent moderately cemented parachanners.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 5 percent.
Other features: Some pedons may have identifiable secondary carbonates as few pendants on rock or pararock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Banbury, Bombadil, Dougal, Fubble, Jaybee, Meninik and Stumount series.

Banbury and Stumount soils have 25 to 35 percent clay throughout the argillic horizon.  Bombadil soils are not calcareous in the argillic horizon.  Dougal soils have slightly acid soil reaction in the argillic horizon.  Fubble soils have lithic contacts at 36 to 50 cm from the soil surface and have identifiable secondary carbonates.  Jaybee soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Meninik soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C and have moderately acid or slightly acid soil reaction above the argillic horizon.  In addition, none of these soils have pararock fragments of schist in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kreza soils are on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum derived from shale, slate, and schist with additions of calcareous eolian material.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,800 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Coppereid and Foxcan soils.  These soils are very shallow to paralithic contacts and do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kreza soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Lahontan sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 2,400 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 27.
