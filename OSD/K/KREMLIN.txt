KREMLIN SERIES 

The Kremlin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources, semiconsolidated sedimentary beds, or alluvium from glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, sedimentary plains, drainageways, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.
