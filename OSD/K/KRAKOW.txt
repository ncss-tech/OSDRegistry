KRAKOW SERIES

The Krakow series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines, drumlins, and glacial lake benches. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, semiactive, frigid Inceptic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Krakow flaggy fine sandy loam, on a northwest-facing, 4 percent slope in an idle field. (Colors are for most soils unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 5 cm (2 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) flaggy fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; about 30 percent flagstones; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [2.5 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) thick]

 E--5 to 28 cm (2 to 11 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) flaggy fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; about 30 percent flagstones; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [2.5 to 23 cm (1 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bt--28 to 41 cm (11 to 16 inches); dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) very flaggy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; firm; common fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; about 50 percent flagstones and channers; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt irregular boundary. [8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 inches) thick]

 C1--41 to 96 cm (16 to 38 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) very flaggy loam; massive; friable; few fine roots; about 55 percent flagstones and channers; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; diffuse irregular boundary. [0 to 81 cm (32 inches) thick]

 C2--96 to 152 cm (38 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) very flaggy loam; massive; friable; about 60 percent flagstones and channers; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Presque Isle County, Michigan; about 1 mile northeast of the town of Posen; 500 feet north and 650 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 2, T. 33 N., R. 6 E., Posen Township; USGS Posen MI topographic quadrangle; lat. 45 degrees 16 minutes 41 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 40 minutes 32 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches)
Depth to lithic contact (limestone): typically deeper than 152 cm (60 inches) but ranges from 102 to 152 cm (40 and 60 inches) in some pedons


A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR, or is neutral
Value: 2 to 4
Chroma: 0 to 3
Texture: dominantly flaggy or very flaggy fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam 
Rock fragment content in the A horizon: 20 to 50 percent flagstones and channers
Rock fragment content in the Ap horizon: many of the flagstones and channers have been removed in cultivated areas
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

E horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: dominantly flaggy or very flaggy fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam
Rock fragment content: 20 to 50 percent flagstones and channers
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or7.5YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 4 or 5
Texture: very flaggy loam, very flaggy clay loam, or very flaggy sandy clay loam
Rock fragment content: 35 to 59 percent flagstones and channers
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: very flaggy loam or very flaggy sandy loam
Rock fragment content: 35 to 59 percent flagstones and channers
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Krakow soils are on ground moraines, drumlins, and glacial lake benches of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 1 to 18 percent. Krakow soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Omena and Onaway soils on similar landscape positions, and the somewhat poorly drained Detour and Hagensville soils in nearby depressions and drainageways. The Omena and Onaway soils contain less rock fragments in the argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Large areas of these soils have been cleared of timber and enough rock fragments removed to make them suitable to use as pasture or cropland. The remaining soils are in second growth woodland. The major species are sugar maple, American basswood, American beech, quaking aspen, white ash and northern white cedar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94C in the northern lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
