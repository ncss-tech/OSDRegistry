DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Kountze soils are moderately well drained.  Runoff is high.  Permeability is moderate. A perched water table exists from about 43 to 64 cm (18 to 24 in) below the soil surface during the late winter and spring months in normal years. An apparent water table exists from 137 to 203 cm (54 to 80 in) below the surface during the late winter and spring months in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of loblolly and longleaf pines, sassafras, yaupon, sweetgum, wax myrtle, blackgum, dewberry, bluestems and panicums.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B) LRR T of southeast Texas and possibly Louisiana.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hardin County, Texas; 1998.

REMARKS: The Kountze soils were formerly included with the Dallardsville series. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon-0 to 64 cm (0 to 25 in (A, E and EB horizon).

Glossic horizon-43 to 203 cm (17 to 80 in) (E/Bt, Bt/E, Btv/Eg horizons  The glossic horizon is series criteria but not diagnostic for classification.).

Argillic horizon--64 to 203 cm (25 to 80 in)(Bt/E, Bt/Eg and Btv/Eg horizons).

Plinthite-137 to 203 cm (54 to 80 in) (Btv/Eg horizons)

These soils remain saturated from 43 to 64 cm (18 to 24 in) below the soil surface for 30 cumulative days in most years.
