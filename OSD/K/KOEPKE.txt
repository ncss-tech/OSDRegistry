KOEPKE SERIES

The Koepke series consists of deep to a densic contact, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over glacial till. The Koepke soils are on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, glassy over isotic, frigid Humic Vitrixerands

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Koepke soils are on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated hills and mountains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial till.  Elevations are 1,900 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 24 inches. The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hunters, Louploup, Mires, Molson, Nevine, Republic, and Scoap soils.  Hunters soils are fine-silty, have a mesic temperature regime, and are on terraces. Louploup soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on till plains and mountains. Mires soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on terraces. Nevine soils do not have a mollic epipedon, are ashy over loamy-skeletal and are on moraines, foothills and mountains. Republic soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are on alluvial fans and terraces. Scoap soils are loamy-skeletal and are on uplands and mountainsides. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate over slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for timber production, livestock grazing, dryland cropland, hay and pasture, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and scattered western larch. Understory species include common snowberry, Saskatoon serviceberry, rose, pinegrass, blue wildrye, silky lupine, spreading sweetroot, and gland cinquefoil. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Washington. MLRA 43A. The series is of moderate extent.
