KODRA SERIES

The Kodra series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Kodra soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xereptic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kodra loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(8 to 13 cm thick)

(5 to 13 cm thick)

    Bqk2--43 to 71 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common fine carbonate filaments; continuous weak silica cementation; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (23 to 30 cm thick)

    Bqkm--71 to 122 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) strongly cemented duripan, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate thick platy structure; very hard, very firm; few very fine roots between hardpan plates; few very fine tubular pores; common fine gypsum filaments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.

    2Cq--122 to 150 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 3 to 13 cm thick lenses of discontinuous weak silica cementation; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 13 miles south and 20 miles east of Crescent Valley, 2,110 feet south and 1,050 feet west of the approximate northeast corner of section 15, T. 27 N., R. 51 E.; USGS Mineral Hill NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 13 minutes 22 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 12 minutes 11 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.2230556 latitude, -116.2036111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to Bqk horizon: 25 to 41 cm.
Depth to duripan:  50 to 75 cm.
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  Less than 15 percent in Bqk horizons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  12 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent.

Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Texture:  Loam or sandy loam.
Structure:  Subangular blocky, prismatic or it is massive.

Bqk horizon 
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.

2Cq horizon  
Value:  6 or 7 dry.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Most pedons are stratified silt loam through sand below the duripan.
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Effervescence:  Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bliss, Eltopia and Truesdale series.  

Bliss soils are very fine sandy loam or silt loam in the particle-size control section and lack a horizon of silica cementation above the duripan. Eltopia soils have a duripan that is weakly or moderately cemented. Truesdale soils have a calcic horizon above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kodra soils are on slightly dissected fan piedmont remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,555 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chiara, Highams, Perwick and Puett soils.  Chiara soils are shallow to an indurated duripan.  Highams soils are frigid and shallow to limestone.  Perwick soils have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Puett soils are shallow to highly weathered tuff.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, slow or medium runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, Sandberg bluegrass and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 24, 25 and 28B.
