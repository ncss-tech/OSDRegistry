KUNATON SERIES



The Kunaton series consists of shallow, well drained soils on basalt

plains.  They formed in loess or silty alluvium.  Permeability is

slow.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is

about 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 51

degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, mesic, shallow Abruptic Xeric Argidurids

Xerollic Durargids.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Kunaton silt loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry

soil unless otherwise noted.)



    E--0 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark yellowish

brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard,

friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine

roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; mildly alkaline (pH

7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)



    Bt--4 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay, dark brown (7.5YR

4/4) moist; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) coatings moist or dry on faces of

peds; moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium

subangular and fine angular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and

plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores;

continuous thick clay films on faces of peds and in pores; mildly

alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)



    Btk--9 to 13 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay, dark

yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular

blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine

roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many moderately thick

clay films on faces of peds and in pores; common fine lime veins

between peds; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt

smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)



    Bkqm--13 to 25 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) duripan, light

yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; white (10YR 8/2) lime coatings

covering the indurated plate-like laminations; dense opalized layer 3

to 6 millimeters thick on upper zone of cementation, laminations are 1

to 3 inches thick separated by 0.5 to 2 inches of loose, violently

effervescent soil material; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy

boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)



    R--25 inches; highly jointed and fractured vesicular basalt.



TYPE LOCATION:  Ada County, Idaho; about 4.75 miles east of Kuna;

approximately 80 feet south and 1,070 feet east of NW corner of section

27, T.2N., R.1E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Average annual soil temperature - 50 to 54 degrees F

Depth to duripan - 10 to 20 inches

Depth to bedrock - 20 to 40 inches

Texture of control section - SICL, SIC, C

Clay content in control section - 38 to 55 percent



E horizon

Value - 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Chroma - 2 through 4



Bt horizon

Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR

Value - 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist

Chroma - 3 or 4



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fulstone, Puls, Ridenbaugh, and

Rogerson(T) series.  Puls soils lack free carbonates in the lower part

of the solum.  Ridenbaugh soils lack bedrock at depths of 20 to 40

inches.  Rogerson soils have average annual soil temperature of 47 to

50 degrees F and lack carbonates above the duripan.  Fulstone soils are

greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kunaton soils are on basalt plains.  Elevations

range from 2,700 to 4,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The soils

formed in a veneer of loess or silty alluvium which overlies basalt.

Average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  Average

January temperature is about 28 degrees F, average July temperature is

about 75 degrees F, and average annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees

F.  Frost-free period is about 110 to 160 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilcott, Colthorp,

Elijah, Purdam, and Sebree soils and the competing Ridenbaugh soils.

Chilcott, Elijah, Purdam, and Sebree soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to

the pan.  Colthorp soils have less than 35 percent clay in the textural

control section.  These soils are on landscape positions similar to

Kunaton soils.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow

permeability.



USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used dominantly for rangeland with

some irrigated cropland.  Principal crops are small grain, corn,

alfalfa and improved pasture.  Vegetation in the potential natural

plant community is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass,

Sandberg bluegrass, and Thurber needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  The soils are moderately

extensive.
