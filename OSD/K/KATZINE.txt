KATZINE SERIES 

The Katzine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz diorite and sandstone.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts during the 60 days following the winter solstice.  It is moist in some part less than 40 percent of the time and moist in all parts less than 25 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  December and August are the wettest months and May and June are the driest.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime. 

Soil temperature - 47 to 58 degrees F. 

Depth to calcic horizon - 6 to 15 inches 

Clay content - less than 18 percent 

Rock fragments - Average 35 to 60 percent. Some individual horizon may contain less than 35 percent in any one horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckndoe (AZ), Chicosa (CO), Saraton (CO), Tinaja (NM), Twobutte (KS), Upler (UT), and Yatne (UT) series.  Buckndoe soils are deep to hardpan. Saraton and Twobutte soils are moderately deep. Chicosa and Tinaja soils exceed 18 percent in clay content within the particle size control section.  Upler and Yatne soils have a Bk horizon that can be more yellow than 7.5YR. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Katzine soils are on risers of fan terraces, hills and mountains.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from calcareous Tertiary quartz diorite and Jurassic or Triassic sandstones. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches in New Mexico and 14 to 20 inches in Arizona with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chazner, Tsezhin and Wetherill soils.  Chazner soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to an indurated calcium carbonate hardpan and occur on adjacent treads of fan terraces.  Tsezhin soils have argillic horizons containing over 27 percent clay and occur on treads of fan piedmonts.  Wetherill soils are fine-silty, have argillic horizons and occur on eolian-mantled surfaces. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Katzine soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and fuelwood production.  Present vegetation is Utah juniper, pinyon, black sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, datil yucca, green Mormon-tea, Indian ricegrass and muttongrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Katzine soils are of small extent on the Red Rock Bench portion-Canyonlands section of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona and northwest New Mexico, in addition to northern Arizona. MLRAs 35 & 36
