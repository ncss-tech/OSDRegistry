KILA SERIES

The Kila series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium, outwash or glaciolacustrine deposits over till. These soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces, lake terraces, and moraines in mountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 530 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Eutrudepts

    2C--105 to 152 centimeters; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very gravelly silt loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; few very fine and fine roots; common fine dendritic tubular pores; 5 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles, and 35 percent gravel; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES: 
There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - stream terraces, outwash terraces, lake terraces, and moraines in mountain valleys. 
Elevation - 875 to 1425 meters. 
Slope - 0 to 8 percent.
Parent material - calcareous alluvium, outwash or glaciolacustrine deposits over till. 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers. 
Mean annual precipitation - 480 to 760 millimeters, much of which falls as snow and spring rain. 
Mean annual air temperature - 3 to 7 degrees C. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Idahocreek, Ashleylake, and Foyslake series. Idahocreek soils have a similar vegetative community.  They are poorly drained and do not have a cambic horizon. Ashleylake and Foyslake soils have grand fir and Douglas-fir vegetative communities, respectively.  They are well-drained and are loamy-skeletal. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained, moderate permeability.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Kila soils are used for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat. Many areas have been cleared and managed as pasture. Potential native vegetation is mainly Engelmann spruce, white spruce, Douglas-fir, western larch, and water birch. The understory vegetation is mainly pinegrass, twinflower, snowberry, bunchberry dogwood, queencup beadlily, and other forbs and shrubs.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kila soils are of small extent in the mountains and valleys of northwestern Montana. MLRA 43A and 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana
 
SERIES PROPOSED: Flathead County, Montana, 2006. The name is from the town of Kila in Flathead County.
 
REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Vitrandic feature - from the mineral soil surface to 56 centimeters (A, Bw horizons)
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 18 centimeters (Oi and part of the A horizons)
Cambic horizon - from 20 to 56 centimeters (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon - from 56 to 105 centimeters (Bk horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 centimeters (part of the Bw and Bk horizons)

Kila soils have a frigid temperature regime and an udic moisture regime. Where present, soil water is primarily from subsurface lateral flow. Depth to water fluctuates throughout the year and from year to year.
