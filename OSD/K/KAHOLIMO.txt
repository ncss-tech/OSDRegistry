KAHOLIMO SERIES

The Kaholimo series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash deposited over pahoehoe lava. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 1,499 millimeters (59 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial, amorphic, isomesic Lithic Hapludands

TYPICAL PEDON: Kaholimo medial silt loam, 4 percent slope under scattered ohia trees, shrubs and grasses at an elevation of 2,006 meters (6,580 feet). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. When described on 6/8/98 the soil was slightly moist throughout. The soil temperature was 15 degrees C. (59 degrees F.) at a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches). All textures are "apparent field textures". pH was measured using organic dyes.)

  A1--0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches); black (10YR 2/1) medial silt loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, weakly smeary; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; strongly acid (pH 5.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches) thick)

  A2--5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches); black (10YR 2/1) medial silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, weakly smeary; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary. (2.5 to 10 centimeters (1 to 4 inches) thick)

  Bw1--10 to 18 centimeters (4 to 7 inches); 1 to 2 centimeters (0.5 inch) bands of black (10YR 2/1) medial loam alternating with 2 centimeter (1 inch) bands of very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) medial loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; few flecks of charcoal at top of horizon; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.

  Bw2--18 to 25 centimeters (7 to 10 inches); 1 to 2 centimeters (0.5 inch) bands of black (10YR 2/1) medial loam alternating with 2 centimeter (1 inch) bands of very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) medial loam; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.

  Bw3--25 to 30 centimeters (10 to 12 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) medial loam; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizons 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick)

  2A--30 to 33 centimeters (12 to 13 inches); black (10YR 2/1) medial loam; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 5 centimeters (0 to 2 inches) thick)

  3R--33 centimeters (13 inches); hard pahoehoe bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park; from State Hwy 11 drive to north end of Mauna Loa Strip Road; from picnic shelter walk downhill on 130 degrees magnetic heading for about 5 minutes to rock wall; cross rock wall and walk along south side to two small fenced enclosures; from SE corner of lowest enclosure walk on a 340 degree magnetic heading for about 27 meters (90 feet); type location is near south side of rock wall; Kipuka Pakekake Quadrangle; lat. 19 degrees 29 minutes 41.6 seconds N. and long. 155 degrees 23 minutes 10.9 seconds W.   (Old Hawaiian Datum. measured by GPS/PLGR,  250 ft.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to bedrock: 2 to 20 inches.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C. (54 to 57 degrees F.).
Soil Reaction: Strongly acid to slightly acid.

A horizon
Hue: 5YR to 10YR.
Value: 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 1 to 3 moist.
Texture: Medial loam, medial silt loam, or medial cobbly loam.
Structure: Granular or subangular blocky.
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 35 percent cobbles.

Bw horizon

Value: 2 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 to 6 moist.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Menehune series. Menehune soils do not have B horizons with alternating black and very dark brown bands. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kaholimo soils are on Mauna Loa pahoehoe flows mainly 200 to 750 years old at elevations of 1,675 to 2,285 meters (5,500 to 7,500 feet). Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual rainfall is 1,270 to 1,524 millimeters (50 to 60 inches), with about 75 percent of the rainfall occurring between November and May. The mean annual pan evaporation is 1,270 to 1,524 millimeters (50 to 60 inches). The mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. (54 to 57 degrees F.).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kulalio, Puiwa, and Wahi series. Kulalio and Wahi soils are skeletal and more than 100 centimeters (40 inches deep). Puiwa soils are more than 50 centimeters (20 inches) deep and do not have alternating bands of black and very dark brown in the B horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is high to very high. Permeability is rapid in the soil and very slow in the underlying pahoehoe bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for National Park Service land and pasture. Vegetation is aalii (Dodonaea viscosa), koa (Acacia koa), kukaenene (Coprosma ernodeoides), mamane (Sophora chrysophylla), Natal redtop (Rhynchelytrum repens) ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), uki (Machaerina angustifolia), and other grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and possibly neighboring ranches; MLRA 160. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Island of Hawaii, Hawaii County, Hawaii, 2008 Proposed in 1998. The name is coined.
