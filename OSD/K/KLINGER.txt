KLINGER SERIES

The Klinger series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 102 centimeters of loess and the underlying glacial till. These soils are on interfluves and long side slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 895 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bremer County, Iowa, 1965

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A, AB, Bg1, and 2Bg2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 200 centimeters (Ap, A, AB, Bg1, 2Bg2, 2Bg3, 2BC1 and 2BC2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (Ap, A, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 200 centimeters (Bg1, 2Bg2, 2Bg3, 2BC1 and 2BC2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Most pedons do not meet the requirements of an argillic horizon (1.2 times clay increase within 30 centimeters.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the glacial till.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data (KSSL).
