KANA`A SERIES

The Kana`a series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in tephra derived from volcanic rock. Kana`a soils are on cinder cones and lava fields. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. (6.7 degrees Celcius) 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Cindery, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Kana`a extremely gravelly coarse sand - woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    C1--0 to 3 inches (0 to 8 cm); dark gray (10YR 4/1) extremely gravelly coarse sand, black (10YR 2/1), moist; 3 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 76 percent cinder fragments; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 7.2; clear smooth boundary.

    C2--3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm); black (10YR 2/1) extremely gravelly loamy sand, black (10YR 2/1), moist; 6 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 77 percent cinder fragments; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 7.2; abrupt smooth boundary.

    C3--6 to 60 inches (15 to 152 cm); black (10YR 2/1) gravel, black (10YR 2/1), moist; 4 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; 96 percent cinder fragments; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 7.2.

TYPE LOCATION: Sunset Crater National Monument, Coconino County, Arizona; Geographic Coordinate System: 35 degrees 23 minutes 0.30 seconds north, 111 dedgrees 30 minutes 18.40 seconds west NAD83

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February. Driest during May and June. Typic ustic soil moisture regime. 

Soil Temperature: 44 to 48 degrees Fahrenheit (6.6 to 8.8 degrees Celsius) 

Particle-size control section (weighted average)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kana`a soils are on cinder cones and lava fields at elevations of 6,500 to 7,500 feet (1,981 to 2,286 meters). Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. These soils formed in tephra derived from volcanic rock. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches (457 to 559 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as snow December to February. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 to 7.7 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackash (AZ), Sunsetcrater (AZ), and Cinderhill (AZ) soils.  Cinderhill soils have a Ashy-skeletal particle size and average less than 60 percent rock fragments or cinders in the control section.  Blackash soils have a Ashy particle size and have less than 35 percent rock fragments or cinders in the control section.  Sunsetcrater soils have a diagnostic cambic horizon with 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; low to negligible runoff; rapid to very rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used primarily for wildlife habitat, recreation, and grazable woodland.  Ponderosa pine is dominant with sand bluestem, blue grama, and apache plum.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. Kana`a soils are of small extent. This soil is named after a wash near the type location. MLRA 39 Land Resource Unit 39.1 above the Mogollon Rim.
