KATY SERIES

The Katy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from the Lissie Formation.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on coastal prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent but the majority is less than 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1145 mm (49 in).

Runoff: low on 0 to 1 percent slopes and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  
Wetness: Seasonal water table occurs due to episaturation in the E horizon for short periods during the cool months or in periods of excess rainfall.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for crop production, mainly rice production, and for livestock grazing.  Some areas are used for growing corn and grain sorghum.  Native grasses consist of little bluestem, indiangrass, big bluestem, switchgrass, crinkleawn, and Florida paspalum.  A few areas near the eastern limit of the extent have pine forest encroachment and many areas have urban development.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 63 to 113 cm (25 to 45 in).  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 63 cm (0 to 25 in).  (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 63 to 203 cm (25 to 80 in).  (Bt horizons)
Iron accumulations: 30 to 203 cm (12 to 80 in).  (E, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)
Pale feature: Many coarse redox concentrations with chroma of 6 or more and clay does not decrease by as much as 20 percent absolute from the maximum clay content within 152 cm (60 in) of the soil surface.

Additional Comments: Classification change from thermic to hyperthermic temperature regime is based on geographic distribution of the series.  In January 2003, classification was changed from an Aquic to Oxyaquic subgroup. A further refinement in soil moisture classification from Oxyaquic to Typic occurred because of the update of MLRA 150A. This change was based on soil moisture monitoring data collected on soils in the area.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S55TX-157-093 from the series type location in Fort Bend County and on Kellogg Soil Survey lab pedon number 05N0203.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  National Soil Survey Laboratory soil characterization data exists on pedon 40A4455 (S55TX-157-093) from the type location in Fort Bend County, Texas. Addiitonal data available from the Kellogg Soil Survey lab on pedon numbers 05N0203 and 89P0031.
