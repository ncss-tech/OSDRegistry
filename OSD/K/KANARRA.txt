KANARRA SERIES

The Kanarra series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from intermediate igneous rocks. Kanarra soils occur on fan remnants, structural benches and mountain slopes and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

Texture: clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.
Rock fragments: 5 to 25 percent, mainly gravel and cobbles. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Banner, Dangulch, Flowell, Gem and Gemson series.  

Banner soils have dominantly silty clay loam and silty clay textures and gravelly loam 2C horizons.  Dangulch soils have a paralithic contact at 100 to 150 cm.  Flowell soils have dominantly silty clay loam textures and 5YR surface horizons.  Gem soils are moderately deep to basalt.  Gemson soils have an argillic horizon to 150 cm or more.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kanarra soils are at elevations of 1,650 to 2,350 meters. They occur on fan remnants, structural benches, and mountain slopes and formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from intermediate igneous rocks. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7.0 to 9.5 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Birdow, Hiko Peak, Red Butte and Sandall soils and the competing Doyce soils. Red Butte Hiko Peak and Sandall soils are loamy-skeletal.  Birdow soils lack calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland and dryland pasture seeded to crested wheatgrass, irrigated cropland wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is dominantly big sagebrush, scattered juniper, serviceberry, and cheatgrass.  These soils are correlated to upland ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Utah. This series is inextensive.  MLRA 28A.
