KUCERA SERIES

The Kucera series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and silty alluvium from mixed sources. They are on terraces, hills, ridges, basalt plains, and hills. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Pachic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kucera silt loam, cropland; on a 17 percent slope at 1,674 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Ap--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thick platy structure parting to moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common  very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

	A--15 to 41 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the A horizons is 20 to 72 cm.)

	AB--41 to 66 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent very hard (cicada) nodules; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 40 cm thick)

	Bw--66 to 86 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; about 5 percent very hard (cicada) nodules; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 36 cm thick)

	Bk1--86 to 112 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, few fine irregularly shaped soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent (18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 51 cm thick)

	Bk2--112 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, common fine and medium irregularly shaped soft masses and threads of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Iphil, Lanoak, Lonjon, Ririe, Rexburg and Sprollow series. Iphil soils occur on slightly convex  positions on hills, have a 18 to 40 cm thick mollic epipedon, and are calcareous to the soil surface. Lanoak soils occur on hills, ridges, fans remnants and mountain slopes, lack a calcic horizons within 109 cm of the mineral soil surface and are fine-silty. Lonjon soils occur on hills and mountain slopes, are calcareous to the surface and are loamy-skeletal. Ririe soils occur on hills, terraces and mountain slopes and have a 18 to 40 cm thick mollic epipedon. Rexburg soils occur on similar landform positions and have a 30 to 50 cm thick mollic epipedon. Sprollow soils occur on ridges, hill slopes and mountain slopes, are calcareous to the surface and are loamy-skeletal.
