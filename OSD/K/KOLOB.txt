KOLOB SERIES

The Kolob series consist of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium and residuum from limestone and sandstone.  Kolob soils are on mesas and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kolob fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    O1--4 1/4 to 3 inches; oak leaves and twigs.

    O2--3 inches to 0; decayed leaves and twigs.

    A--0 to 6 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine, few medium and coarse roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    BAt--6 to 10 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few fine medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial pores; few thin clay films in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--10 to 18 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bt2--18 to 28 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial pores; many thin clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (9 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt3--28 to 39 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 70 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (11 to 19 inches thick)

    Bt4--39 to 52 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; few thin clay films in pores; 70 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 16 inches thick)

    Rt--52 inches; fractured limestone with clay loam, properties extending into cracks similar to the above horizon.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washington County, Utah; one mile east of Lava Point in Zion National Park; in the southwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section 30, T. 39 S., R. 10 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  They are continually moist for 35 to 45 days during the summer months and only 45 to 60 days during the winter and early spring.  The soil moisture regime is typic ustic.

The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 14 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The depth to calcium carbonate is more than 40 inches.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It ranges from gravelly clay loam or very cobbly clay with estimated 35 to 50 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 50 percent in the upper 4 to 18 inches and 40 to 90 percent in the lower part of the horizon.

A C horizon is present in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alamaditas (CO), Showalter (UT), and Sirref (UT) series.  Alamaditas soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Showalter soils are very deep and have calcic horizons.  Sirref soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kolob soils are on mesas and mountain slopes at elevations of 6,000 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium, alluvium and residuum from limestone and sandstone.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  Freeze-free period is about 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Detra, Kinesava, and Paunsaugunt soils.  Detra and Kinesava soils lack rock fragments and have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Paunsaugunt soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock, have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as rangeland and recreation areas.  Potential vegetation is Gambel oak, snowberry, antelope bitterbrush, mountain brome, serviceberry, Nevada bluegrass, and peavine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Utah.  This series is inextensive in the Washington survey area, but extends into adjacent areas. MLRA 30, 35, 47, 48A
