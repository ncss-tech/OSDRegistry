KOLOB SERIES

The Kolob series consist of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium and residuum from limestone and sandstone. Kolob soils are on mesas and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kolob fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; oak leaves and twigs.

    Oe--5 to 13 cm; decayed leaves and twigs.

    A--13 to 28 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine, few medium and coarse roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (11 to 25 cm thick)

    BAt--28 to 38 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few fine medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial pores; few thin clay films in pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 14 cm thick)

    Bt1--38 to 58 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; extremely firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--58 to 83 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and fine, and few medium interstitial pores; many thin clay films on faces of peds; 50 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt3--83 to 111 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine, medium and coarse roots; common very fine and few fine interstitial pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds; 70 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt4--111 to 144 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; few thin clay films in pores; 70 percent gravel and cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons - 70 to 150 cm)

    Rt--144 cm; fractured limestone with clay loam, properties extending into cracks similar to the above horizon.

Thickness of mollic epipedon--25 to 36 cm
Depth to bedrock--100 to 150 cm
Depth to calcium carbonate--more than 100 cm

A horizon
Hue--10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR

Some pedons have a C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alamaditas (CO), Showalter (UT), and Sirref (UT) series.  Alamaditas soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Showalter soils are very deep and have calcic horizons. Sirref soils are very deep.

Slope--2 to 60 percent
Parent Material--colluvium, alluvium and residuum from limestone and sandstone
Mean annual temperature--4 to 7 degrees C
Mean summer temperature--18 to 21 degrees C
Average annual precipitation--410 to 560 mm
Frost-free period--90 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as rangeland and recreation areas.  Potential vegetation is Gambel oak, snowberry, antelope bitterbrush, mountain brome, serviceberry, Nevada bluegrass, and peavine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kolob soils are moderately extensive in parts of southwest and northern Utah, central New Mexico and western Colorado. MLRAs 47, 48A
