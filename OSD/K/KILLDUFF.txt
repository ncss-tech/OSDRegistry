The gray colors are relic features that are related stratigraphically to a deoxidized weathering zone.  The depth to maximum percent clay, depth to free carbonates, and depth to relict gray colors decrease with increasing percent gradient on convex slopes.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jasper County, Iowa, 1975.

REMARKS:  
Killduff soils are on short, convex to straight side slopes, coves at the head of drainageways, and in a few places, the tops of lowered interfluves in uplands.  These soils formed in a deoxidized and leached or a thin, mottled, oxidized and leached over a deoxidized and leached weathering zone in Wisconsinan Age loess.  The loess is 4 to 15 feet thick and is underlain by pre-Wisconsin glacial till.
Clay films are noticeable, but the increase in clay from the A to the B horizons fails to meet the 1.2 required for an argillic horizon.  The gray colors were not used in the classification of this soil, as they are considered to be inherited from a relict deoxidized and leached weathering zone.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (9 inches Ap and A horizons); 
cambic horizon - the zone from 23 to 117 centimeters (9 to 46 inches (BA, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and BC horizons).
