KIWANIS SERIES

The Kiwanis series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. They are on valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kiwanis loam - grass cover.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral (pH 7.0); clear boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine crumb structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; neutral (pH 7.0); clear boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--9 to 36 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) fine sandy loam and pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; moderate effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt boundary.  (18 to 30 inches thick)

    2C2--36 to 58 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) coarse sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grained; loose; moderate effervescence; moderately alkaline.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

    2C3--58 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravel and sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grained; loose; moderate effervescence.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - valley floors
Elevation - 3,000 to 5,000 feet
Slope - 0 to 9 percent
Parent material - alluvium from mixed rock sources
Climate - cool and semiarid
Average annual precipitation - 12 to 17 inches
Average annual temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 90 to 130 days

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for growing grain and for native grass pasture.  Native vegetation is Sandberg bluegrass, needle-and-thread grass, lupine, fringed sagewort, snowberry and open stands of ponderosa pine and cottonwood trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kiwanis soils are moderately extensive in northern and western Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Upper Flathead Area, Montana, 1958.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (A1 and part of the A2 horizon); and a lithologic discontinuity at 36 inches (2C horizon). Kiwanis soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.
