COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: poorly drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over fine-silty diatomaceous earth
Landform: bogs on stream terraces
Slopes: 0 to 4 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 35 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: about 16 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Soldotna and Salamatof soils. Soldotna soils are well drained and occur on moraines. Salamatof soils are very poorly drained organic soils that occur on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, very high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. The native vegetation is grasses, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska, The series is of small extent.
