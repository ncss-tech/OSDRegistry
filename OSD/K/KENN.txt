KENN SERIES

The Kenn series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These level to gently sloping soils are on flood plains of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 1168 cm (46 in).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kenefick, Speer, and Wiville series in the same family.
Kenefick soils occur in another MLRA, have sola greater than 80 inches thick, and do not have a lithologic disontinuity.
Speer soils have less than 10 percent coarse fragments in the BC and C horizons, and do not have a lithologic discontinuity. 
iville soils occur in another MLRA, have sola greater than 60 inches, do not have a lithologic discontinuity, and formed in eolian deposits.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kenn soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains of the Ouachita Mountains, MLRA 119, and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges, MLRA 118. They have formed in loamy alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent but is commonly 0 to 2 percent. These soils are subject to flooding for very brief periods mainly during January to July. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 56 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Speer series and the Avilla, Carnasaw, Ceda, Cupco, Dela, Neff, Rexor, Wetsaw, and Wilburton series. Avilla soils occur on higher terrace positions, have sola greater than 60 inches, and have lower base saturation.
Carnasaw soils are on the adjacent mountains, have a clayey control section, and are underlain with shale at depths of 40 to 60 inches.
Ceda soils commonly occur upstream and closer to the source of sediments and have a loamy-skeletal control section. 
Cupco soils are in level to slightly concave positions, are very poorly drained, and are in a fine-silty textural class.
Dela soils occur closer to the stream channel, do not have an argillic horizon, and are in a coarse-loamy textural class. 
Neff soils are somewhat poorly drained and have fine-silty control section.
Neff, Rexor, and Speer soils commonly occur downstream and farther from the source of sediments.
Wetsaw soils occur are benches and terraces, have a clayey lower Bt formed in shale residuum, and are in an Aquic subgroup.
Wilburton soils occur on non-flooded alluvial and colluvial positions, have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, and do not have a lithologic discontinuity.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Kenn soils are well drained. Runoff is slow to medium and permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for tame pasture and woodland. The vegetation is primarily post oak, southern red oak, sweetgum, and shortleaf pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Flood plains of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The series is of minor extent
