KUCU SERIES

The Kucu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone, over very old alluvium.  Kucu soils are on paleoterraces.  Slopes range from 3 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cahona, Canina, Plughat and Villegreen series. Cahona and Canina soils are very deep and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the substratum.  Plughat soils are deep over a lithic contact while Villegreen soils are moderately deep.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wetherill and Dolcan series.  The Wetherill soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the substratum and do not have petrocalcic fragments.  They are on mesas and paleoterraces.  The Dolcan soils are shallow and derived from residual shale.  They are on sideslopes of paleoterraces.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing. Potential natural vegetation is mainly twoneedle pinyon, Utah juniper, muttongrass, Indian ricegrass, and true mountain mahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest Colorado, Ute Mountain Indian Reservation, Montezuma County, Colorado; MLRA 36; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Montezuma County, Colorado, Ute Mountain Soil Survey Area, parts of Colorado and New Mexico, 2005.  The name is the Ute word for buffalo.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 79 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 5 to 15 inches.  (Bt horizon)
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 5 inches.  (A and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 5 to 15 inches.  (Bt horizon)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 15 to 38 inches.  (2Bk1, 2Bk2, 2Bk3 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Bk horizon. 

Other features: The 2Bk2 horizon has 80 percent cemented material with troweled and laminar surfaces.  The material is not continuous enough to qualify as a petrocalcic horizon.  

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
The alluvial deposits for this soil are from ancient Mancos River deposits.  Source for the igneous material is the La Plata Mountains 25 miles to the northeast.  The Mancos River is now located approximately 8 miles northwest and 1000 feet lower in elevation than the type location.
