KWIAVU SERIES

The Kwiavu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from diorite.  Kwiavu soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 6 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kwiavu loam, on a northeast facing, 12 percent slope in oak brush at an elevation of 7944 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Montezuma County, Colorado, Ute Mountain Area, Colorado and New Mexico, 2005.  The name Kwiavu, (Kwee-UH-vuh) is the Ute word for oak.  

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 9 to 29 inches.  (BAt, part of the Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 9 to 60 inches.  (BAt, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)
The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
