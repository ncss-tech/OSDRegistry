KLONDIKE SERIES

The Klondike series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium from shale, siltstone and sandstone on hills. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic, shallow Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Klondike sandy clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil 
unless otherwise noted.)
 A--0 to 1 inch (0 to 3 cm); reddish brown (5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) (3 to 7 cm).

 Bw--1 to 5 inches (3 to 13 cm); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many fine 
tubular pores; few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent 
gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.(4 to 9 inches thick)(10 to 23 cm).

 Bky--5 to 11 inches (13 to 28 cm); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular 
pores; 10 percent gravel; thick lime coatings on underside of gravel; common 
gypsum crystals; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt 
smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick) (13 to 20 cm).

 2Cr--11 inches (28 cm); thin bedded, fractured calcareous sandstone; many thick dark 
reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist clay films; common lime coatings and few gypsum 
crystals in fractures.

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; about 3.5 miles southeast of Fredonia; 
2,000 feet south and 300 feet west of the northeast corner of section 3, T.40N., 
R.2W. Shinarump Point USGS Quadrangle; Latitude 38 degrees 53 minutes 53 seconds North and longitude 112 degrees 28 minutes 56 seconds West. (Coordinates derived from PLSS location information.) 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February. Driest during May and June. Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Rock fragments - 0 to 35 percent pebbles or channers
Organic matter - Less than 1 percent
Gypsum- 0.5 to 5 percent
Depth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 cm)
Clay content - averages 18 to 27 percent clay

A horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist

B horizon
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist
Carbonates: Strongly or violently effervescent; less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent
Reaction: Mildly or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kinusta(AZ) and Sinbad(UT) series. Kinusta soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Sinbad soils are typically cooler having a mean annual soil temperatures of 46 to 52 degrees F (8.3 to 11 degrees C).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Klondike soils are on hills. These soils formed in alluvium from shale, siltstone and interbedded calcareous sandstone. Eolian sands are minor in the surface layer. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 4600 to 5,400 feet(1400 to 1646 meters). Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches (25 to 36 cm) occurring as summer thunderstorms and winter rain and snow. Mean annual air temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F (8.9 to 12.8 degrees C). Frost-free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barx, Curob, and Manikan series. 
Barx and Manikan soils are very deep. Curob soils have a petrocalcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing. Vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, fourwing saltbush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. The Klondike series is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 1 inch (0 to 3 cm)(A horizon)
Entisol feature - the absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons
Paralithic contact - the boundary at 11 inches (28 cm)
