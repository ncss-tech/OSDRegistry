KINGMAN SERIES

The Kingman series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These nearly level soils are on flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A) and the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79).  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 28 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 58 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, calcareous, thermic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kingman silty clay loam - in grassland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A1--0 to 10 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; hard, firm; many roots; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

   A2--10 to 18 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; strong medium granular structure; hard, firm; many roots; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 24 inches.)

   Bkg1--18 to 40 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 6/1) dry; common medium distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation with diffuse boundaries; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common roots; a few thin strata of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) material; common concretions and soft accumulations of carbonates; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary. (10 to 22 inches thick)

   Bkg2--40 to 50 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 6/1) dry; common medium distinct very pale brown (10YR 7/4) irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation with diffuse boundaries; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine roots; common soft accumulations of carbonates; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 18 inches thick)

  2C--50 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; common medium distinct reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6) irregularly shaped masses of iron accumulation with diffuse boundaries; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; massive; soft, very friable; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Stafford County, Kansas; 6 1/2 miles south and 1 mile west of Stafford; 1,980 feet north and 80 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 22, T. 25 S., R. 12 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.  Free carbonates are at depths less than 10 inches.  The soils are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is silty clay loam and less commonly loam or clay loam.  The lower part of this horizon has faint or distinct redoximorphic features in some pedons.

The Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic accumulations range from faint to distinct and have a value of 5 to 7 and a chroma of 4 to 6.

The 2C or C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Kingman series is the only series in its family.  Competing series in other families are the Gibbon, Plevna, Sweetwater, Waldeck, and Zenda series.  Gibbon soils are mesic.  Plevna and Waldeck soils are coarse-loamy.  Sweetwater soils have contrasting textures.  Zenda soils are fine-loamy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kingman soils are on flood plains that have a plane or slightly concave surface.   The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 2 percent.   The soils formed in loamy alluvium.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 30 inches.  Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 38 to 54.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carwile, Naron, Plevna, Waldeck, and Zenda soils.   The fine textured Carwile soils and better drained Naron soils are on nearby uplands.  Plevna, Waldeck, and Zenda soils are on similar positions as Kingman soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The water table is at or near the surface during some period of most years and drops to 2 feet during late summer.  These soils are occasionally flooded.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for range or hay meadow.  Vegetation is mainly tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Kansas and possibly adjacent areas of Oklahoma.  The series is of small extent.
