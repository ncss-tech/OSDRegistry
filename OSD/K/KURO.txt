KURO SERIES 

The Kuro series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated shale or in colluvium over the shale. These soils are on hills and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid, shallow Typic Ustorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kuro clay loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/3) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 9 inches thick) 

    C--7 to 15 inches; weak red (10R 4/3) pale yellow (5Y 7/3) clay loam, dusky red (10R 3/3) olive (5Y 5/3) moist; colors in very thin horizontal bands; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to strong thin platy; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; slightly effervescent; with few fine threads of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick) 

    Cr--15 to 60 inches; weak red (10R 4/3) and pale yellow (5Y 7/3) shale, slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

Reaction:  pH 7.4 to 8.4 


Cr horizon - this horizon consists of semiconsolidated shale which is extremely hard when dry and extremely firm when moist. 

Reaction:  pH 7.9 to 9.0 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - hills and sedimentary plains. 

Elevation - 2,500 to 4,600 feet. 

Slope - 2 to 45 percent. 

Parent material - residuum from semiconsolidated shale or in colluvium over the shale. 

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers. 

Precipitation - 12 to 16 inches. 

Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 45 degrees F. 

Frost-free period - 90 to 135 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kuro soils are used mainly for grazing.   Potential native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, blue grama, prairie junegrass, fringed sagewort, and threadleaf sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kuro soils are inextensive, occurring throughout the unglaciated parts of northern and central Montana east of the Rocky Mountains. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Glacier County (Blackfeet Reservation-Cut Bank Area), Montana, 1969. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0448.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 15 inches (C horizon); a paralithic contact at a depth of 15 inches (Cr horizon).  Kuro soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
