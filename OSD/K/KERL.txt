KERL SERIES

The Kerl series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial material and alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kerl loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw1--7 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear irregular boundary. (5 to 11 inches thick).

    Bw2--14 to 20 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk--20 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; violently effervescent; common masses and threads of lime; 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES:

Araveton (ID) - has a calcic horizon; has 15 percent or more stones and flagstones in the cambic horizon.
Causey (UT) - has 15 to 65 percent soft gravel in the horizons of carbonate accumulation; formed in material derived from volcanic activity such as tuffaceous sandstone, siltstone, and limestone with a high phosphate content.
Kuvasz (ID) - is moderately deep to a lithic contact.
Picayune (UT) - has more than 27 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent cobbles and gravel in the B2 horizon.
Revis (OR) - depth to carbonates more than 40 inches; has a discontinuity at a depth of 17 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and till plains.
Elevation - 2,800 to 3,600 feet.
Slope - 0 to 20 percent.
Parent material - glaciofluvial material and alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist falls and springs; warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 18 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Niarada, Polson, and Belton soils. Niarada soils are loamy-skeletal and have calcic horizons. Polson and Belton soils have natric horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kerl soils are used as nonirrigated and irrigated cropland and rangeland.  The potential native vegetation is rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Kerl soil is moderately extensive in the intermountain valleys of western Montana.  MLRA 44A and 46.
