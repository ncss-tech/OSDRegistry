KINGFISHER SERIES

The Kingfisher series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy material weathered from silty shale red beds of Permian age.  These soils are on alluvial plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA-80A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 840 mm (33 in), and mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Udic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kingfisher silt loam in a cultivated field, at an elevation of 348 m (1140 ft).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. 

  A--15 to 36 cm (6 to 14 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/3) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; many fine pores; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Ap and A horizon is 20 to 81 cm [8 to 16 in])

  BA--36 to 53 cm (14 to 21 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; hard, friable; many fine roots; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the BA horizon is 8 to 25 cm [3 to 10 in])

  Bt1--53 to 81 cm (21 to 32 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common fine roots throughout peds; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  

  Bt2--81 to 97 cm (32 to 38 in); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine pores; few fine roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 25 to 64 cm [10 to 25 in]) 

  Cr--97 to 122 cm (38 to 48 in); red (2.5YR 5/8) weathered silty shale, red (2.5YR 4/8) moist; weakly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other soils in this family.  Similar soils are the Grant and Vanoss series.  Both soils have a higher cation-exchange activity class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: formed in loamy material weathered from silty shale red beds of Permian age
Landscape: uplands
Landform: alluvial plains 
Slope: 0 to 8 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 762 to 914 mm (26 to 38 in)
Mean annual air temperature: 14 to 16 degrees C (58 to 60 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 200 to 230 days
Elevation: 213 to 457 m (700 to 1500 ft)
Thornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Ironmound, Piedmont, and Renthin series.
Ironmound soils: are shallow to bedrock
Piedmont soils: have a fine particle-size control section
Renthin soils: are greater than 102 cm (40 in) to bedrock
All three soils occur on similar positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: well drained
Permeability: moderately slow 
Runoff: medium on 0 to 1 percent slopes, high on 1 to 5 percent slopes and very high on 5 to 8 percent slopes

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for cropland, for growing winter wheat. Native vegetation was tallgrass prairie.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR H; Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A) of North-central Oklahoma and probably in south-central Kansas.  The series is of moderate extent.
