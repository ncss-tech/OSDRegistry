KOYOKEE SERIES

The Koyokee series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  These soils formed in Tertiary sediments.  Slope is 4 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 2,800 to 3,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Mollic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Koyokee gravelly loam, 4 to 15 percent slopes, in rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots and few coarse roots; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt--3 to 11 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly silty clay, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots and few coarse roots; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick)

    Btk--11 to 19 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches)

    Bk--19 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 25 percent cobbles and 25 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Sanders County, Montana; 2,200 feet west and 2,500 feet south of the NE corner of sec. 31, T. 23 N., R. 23 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans and stream terraces.

Elevation - 2,800 to 3,200 feet.

Slope - 4 to 30 percent.

Parent material - Tertiary sediments.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs and falls; hot, dry summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 17 inches.

Mean annual temperature - 41 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 105 to 120 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Koyokee soils are used for pasture and rangeland.  The potential native plant community is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough rescue, prairie junegrass, and big sage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Koyokee soils are of limited extent in the intermountain valleys of northwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanders County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1224.  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:  a three inch dark colored surface (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 3 to 19 inches (Bt and Btk horizons); carbonate accumulations from 11 to 60 inches (Btk and Bk horizons); a particle size control section from 3 to 19 inches (Bt and Btk horizons).  Koyokee soils have a frigid temperature regime and a xeric moisture regime.
