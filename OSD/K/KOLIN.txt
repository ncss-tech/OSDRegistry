KOLIN SERIES

The Kolin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments overlying clayey sediments. These soils are on stream terraces of Pleistocene Age. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation is about 1448 cm (57 in).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rapides Parish, Louisiana, 1972.

REMARKS: 
The Kolin series was first proposed as fine-silty, siliceous, thermic Glossaquic Paleudalfs and submitted for review in 1972 with change in the definition of "a glossic horizon". With further examination of pedons the concept was changed to a fine-silty, siliceous thermic Haplic Glossudalf.  The series was updated in 2004 to change the classification back to a Glossaquic Paleudalf based on changes made to the 9th ed. Keys to Taxonomy which places Paleudalfs higher on the key than Glossudalfs, and on water monitoring data at a site in Bossier Parish, Louisiana.  Further study is still needed to verify that the correct mineralogy class for Kolin soils is siliceous. Some data from Bossier Parish indicate that it may be mixed.  The series was also updated in 2004 to allow 2.5Y hue in the Glossic horizon and in the 2Bt horizon, and to allow a gray matrix in the parts of the subsoil just below the discontinuity.
