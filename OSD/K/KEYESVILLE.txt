KEYESVILLE SERIES

The Keyesville series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils moderately deep to sandstone bedrock.  These upland soils formed in loamy slope alluvium over sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone.  These soils are on hills in bedrock controlled uplands.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy slope alluvium, rapid in the sandy residuum, and moderate or moderately slow in the sandstone.  Slope ranges from 20 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Typic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Keyesville sandy loam on a convex, southwest-facing slope of 38 percent, in a woodland, at an elevation of 311 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) About 10 percent of the surface is covered by sandstone channers.  

    Oe--0 to 2 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) moderately decomposed plant material; about 45 percent fiber and 20 percent rubbed; weak thin platy structure; non-sticky; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

    A--2 to 10 centimeters; black (10YR 2/1) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common very fine and fine roots; about 10 percent sandstone channers; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.(5 to 15 centimeters thick)

    Bw1--10 to 46 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) channery sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; about 25 percent sandstone channers; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 50 centimeters thick) 

    2Bw2--46 to 61 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very channery loamy sand; single grain; loose; about 38 percent sandstone channers and 13 percent sandstone flagstones; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 38 centimeters thick)

    2Cr--61 to 102 centimeters; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) weakly cemented sandstone; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) 105-Northern Mississippi Valley Loess Hills, Richland County, Wisconsin; about 1.5 miles north of Sabin; located about 950 feet east and 600 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 2, T. 11 N., R. 2 W.; USGS Sabin topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 27 minutes 12 seconds N.; long. 90 degrees 35 minutes 07 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Berks, Blasdell, Brownstown, Brownsville, Cadosia, Calvin, Cloverlick, Deadline, Highsplint, Jubin, Judyville, Lippitt, Manlius, Matewan, Nailkeg, Peaks, Solon, Sylco, Warwick, and Wyoming series. 
Berks, Blasdell, Brownstown, Brownsville, Cadosia, Calvin, Cloverlick, Deadline, Highsplint, Jubin, Judyville, Lippit, Manlius, Matewan, Nailkeg, Peaks, Sylco, Warwick and Wyoming soils do not have a paralithic contact at depths of 50 to 102 centimeters.
Solon soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity of sandy residuum from sandstone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material--loamy slope alluvium over sandstone residuum and in the underlying sandstone
Landform--hills in bedrock controlled uplands 
Geologic formation--Jordan sandstone
Elevation--290 to 335 meters 
Mean annual air temperature--9 to 11 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation--762 to 864 millimeters

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Brownchurch and Basco soils near the Type Location.
Brownchurch--are on lower landscape positions, formed in loamy slope alluvium over silty slope alluvium, and do not have a paralithic contact with sandstone above 152 centimeters
Basco--are on higher landscape positions and have a fine particle size class

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage classsomewhat excessively drained--a saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 1.8 meters during April to June in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--14.11-42.34 micrometers per second (moderately rapid) in the loamy slope alluvium, 42.34-141.14 micrometers per second (rapid) in the sandy residuum, and 1.41-4.23 micrometers per second

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Richland County, Wisconsin, 2002.  Name comes from a road in
Richland County.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 2 to 10 centimeters. 
Cambic horizon: The zone from 10 to 61 centimeters.
Paralithic contact: The contact with sandstone at 61 centimeters.

The Jordan Formation is interstratified with finer strata in places. However, the loamy slope alluvium is not from this formation but rather from the mixing of the loess and mass wasting of the clayey pedisediment (Rountree) from the surrounding Oneota and Shakopee Formations, which dominate the area. The 5YR and 7.5YR hues are indicative of this material. The Basco series, which also is formed from the mass wasting of the clayey pedisediment, is mapped on the higher positions on the landscape.
