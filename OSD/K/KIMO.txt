KIMO SERIES

The Kimo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, soils old channels on flood plain steps. They formed in clayey over loamy alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C. (54 degree F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey over loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kimo silty clay loam - cultivated. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A1--18 to 38centimeters (7 to 15 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

  A2--38 to 58 centimeters (15 to 23 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 31 to 61 centimeters (12 to 24 inches.) 

  AC--58 to 69 centimeters (23 to 27 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 31 centimeters (0 to 12 inches thick) 

  2C1--69 to 107 centimeters (27 to 42 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; neutral; diffuse wavy boundary. 

 2C2--107 to 152 centimeters (42 to 60 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; thin strata of light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sand; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Leta and Parkville in the same family and the Blase, Blencoe, Muscotah, Onawa, Percival, and Wabash series. 
Leta and Parkville soils are calcareous at or near the surface.
Blase soils are more acid.
Blencoe soils have 2C horizons with more than 18 percent clay.
Onawa and Percival soils lack mollic epipedons.
Muscotah and Wabash soils are clayey throughout. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belvue, Bismarckgrove, Bourbonais, Eudora, Kiro, Stonehouse, and Zeandale soils.
Belvue soils are coarse-silty and have carbonates below 51 centimeters (20 inches). 
Bismarckgrove soils are fine-silty and sit somewhat higher on the landscape.
Bourbonais soils are coarse-silty over sandy and are higher on the floodplain.
Eudora soils are coarse-silty and have a mollic epipedon.
Kiro soils are fine and in a depression. 
Stonehouse soils are sandy and are higher on the floodplain. 
Zeandale soils have carbonates throughout.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: Somewhat poorly drained
Runoff: negligible to low 
Saturated Hydraulic conductivity:  moderately low

USE AND VEGETATION: Most Kimo soils are cultivated. Principal crops are small-
grains, sorghum, alfalfa, soybeans, and corn. Native vegetation was tall prairie grasses with occasional deciduous trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: LRR M; MLRA 106: Kimo soils occur along the Kansas River in northeast Kansas. This series is moderately extensive.
