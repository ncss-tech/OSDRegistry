KANGAS SERIES

The Kangas series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glacial outwash. Kangas soils and terraces are on outwash and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Typic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kangas fine gravelly loamy coarse sand, range.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine gravelly loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose; many very fine and fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 24 inches thick)

    A2--8 to 16 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine gravelly loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; loose, very friable, slightly sticky; many fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--16 to 35 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; loose, very friable, slightly sticky; common very fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 26 inches thick)

    C2--35 to 42 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine gravelly loamy coarse sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; single grained; loose, very friable; few very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick)

    C3--42 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine gravelly coarse sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grained; loose, very friable; few very fine roots; slightly acid (pH 6.3).

TYPE LOCATION:  Valley County, Idaho; about 7 miles south of Cascade, 1,640 feet west and 1,420 feet south of the Northeast corner of section 5, T. 12 N., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Average annual soil temperature - 40 to 42 degrees F.
Average summer soil temperature - 53 to 57 degrees F.
Depth to sand and pebbles - 20 to 45 inches
Control section (10 to 40 inch depth) - 20 to 35 percent fine pebbles

A horizons
Value - 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist
Base saturation - 40 to 50 percent

C horizons
Value - 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma - 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 6 moist

The fine earth fraction is LS to COS

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kangas soils are on outwash plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. They formed in glacial outwash. Elevations are 3,800 to 5,100 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 22 to 24 inches.  Average January temperature is 20 degrees F.; average July temperature is 64 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 38 degrees to 40 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Roseberry and Melton soils. Roseberry and Melton soil are poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for pasture and range. Vegetation is mainly Kentucky bluegrass, Idaho fescue, bromegrass and big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Distributed in the high colder mountain valleys, mainly in Valley County, Idaho. The soil is inextensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Valley Area, Idaho, 1977

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 16 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)

Temperature regime - cryic

Moisture regime - udic

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Sandy, mixed Humic Dystrocryepts to Sandy, mixed Typic Humicryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
