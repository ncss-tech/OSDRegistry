KAMAY SERIES

The Kamay series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey redbeds.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Typic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kamay silt loam--rangeland.                 (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

     A--0 to 10 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive and very hard when dry; friable; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

     Bt1--10 to 17 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular and angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; many clay films on surfaces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

     Bt2--17 to 36 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm; many clay films on surfaces of peds; slightly alkaline to 24 inches; strongly effervescent and moderately alkaline below; gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

     Btk--36 to 58 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm; many clay films on surfaces of peds; 5 percent calcium carbonate concretions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (15 to 48 inches thick)

     Bt1'--58 to 75 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm; many clay films on surfaces of peds; few calcium carbonate concretions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

     Bt2'--75 to 80 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; moderate coarse angular blocky structure; very hard, firm; few clay films on surfaces of peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 18 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Wichita County, Texas; from the intersection of U.S.  Highway 287 and Farm Road 368 in Iowa Park, 7.0 miles north on Farm Road 368, 3.0 miles west on Farm Road 2345, 0.7 mile north on county road, 400 feet east in rangeland. (Latitude: 34N, 04, 26; Longitude: 98W, 43, 47)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to films, threads, masses or concretions of calcium carbonate ranges from 12 to 28 inches.  Average clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  The boundary between the A and Bt horizon is abrupt or clear with an abrupt textural change.

The A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam and it is massive and hard or very hard when dry.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

The Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonates content rangse from none in the upper part to about 2 percent.

The Btk or Bt' horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or clay.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The Btk horizon has 3 to about 15 percent concretions and/or masses of calcium carbonate.  The Bt' horizon, where present, has less than 3 percent carbonates.

Some pedons have a BC, BCt, or BCtk horizons in shades of red, brown or yellow.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or clay.

The Cr horizon, when encountered, has colors in shades of red or brown with strata or mottles in shades of gray or brown.  It is dense clay or shale and restricts roots.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other competing series.  Similar soils are the Abilene, Bethany, Bronte, Foard, Hollister, Kirkland, Renfrow, Rotan, Sagerton, Tillman, and Wichita series.  Abilene, Hollister, Kirkland, and Rotan soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Foard soils have a natric horizon.  Renfrow soils have vertic properties.  Sagerton and Tillman soils have mollic epipedons and do not have an abrupt textural change.  Wichita soils are similar in morphology but do not have an abrupt textural change, and have mixed clay mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kamay soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands.  Slopes are mainly less than 2 percent but range up to 3 percent.  The soil formed in ancient alluvium derived from red bed clays and shales.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 32 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,300 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 36 to 46.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Foard, Sagerton, Tillman, Wichita, and Winters series and the Vernon series.  Vernon soils do not have a Bt horizon.  All these series are in similar or slightly higher positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is low on slopes less than 1 percent, and medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  About one-half of these soils are cultivated. Small grains are the main crops.  Present vegetation consists of buffalograss, gramas, tridens, and mesquite trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rolling Red Prairie (80A) and North Central Prairie (80B) of Texas, and possibly southwestern Oklahoma.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Baylor County, Texas; 1971.

REMARKS:  These soils fail Mollisols in that the surface layers are hard and massive when dry.  These soils were formerly included in the Kirkland and Tillman series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 10 inches, hard and massive when dry
                  (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - 10 to 90 inches (Bt horizons)

Pale feature - abrupt textured change between A and Bt1
               horizon at 10 inches.
