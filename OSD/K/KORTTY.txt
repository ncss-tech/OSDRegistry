KORTTY SERIES

The Kortty series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and loess derived from mixed rocks.  Kortty soils are on summits of fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  At present, there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kortty soils are on summits of fan remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,485 to 1,650 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clurde and Sodhouse soils.  Clurde soils are fine-loamy, very deep, and have cambic horizons and horizons of silica accumulation. Sodhouse soils are loamy, shallow to indurated duripans, and have cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kortty soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, winterfat, and halogeton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada. These soils are not extensive, with about 3,500 acres of the series mapped to date. MLRA 25.
