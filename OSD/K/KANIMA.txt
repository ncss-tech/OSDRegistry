KANIMA SERIES

The Kanima series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in a regolith from surface coal mining operations and weathered from sandstone, shale, and limestone of the Pennsylvanian age. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16.1 degrees C. (61 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 1143 mm (45 inches).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, spolic, mixed, active, nonacid, thermic Anthroportic Udorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Kanima gravelly silty clay loam-9 percent slope in idle land, at an elevation of 213.7 m (511 feet) above sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches); very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) gravelly silty clay loam; weak fine subangular; friable; shale gravel fragments make up 20 percent by volume; few fine coal fragments; neutral; diffuse wavy boundary.  [10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) thick]

 C--15 to 183 cm (6 to 72 inches); very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) extremely gravelly silty clay loam; massive; friable; very dark gray (N 3/0) shale gravel fragments make up 70 percent by volume in the upper part and 85 percent by volume in the lower part; coal fragments make up 2 percent by volume; few fragments of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) granular silt loam and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam having thin patchy clay films; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Haskell County, Oklahoma; about 3 miles south of Tamaha, 2,100 feet south and 1,300 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 8, T. 10 N., R. 22 E. USGS Keota topographic quadrangle; UTM Grid Zone 15, 318680 m easting, 3914374 m northing, WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Coal fragments: 0 to 5 percent in all horizons.
Particle Size control section: averages 27 to 35 percent clay, at a depth of 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 inches)
Depth to argillic (where present): 15 to 183 cm (6 to 72 inches)

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: Loam in conjunction with gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or stony modifiers. Silt loam in conjunction with gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, stony, or very channery modifiers. Clay loam in conjunction with gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, stony, or channery modifiers. Silty clay loam in conjunction with gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, stony, or channery modifiers. Gravelly silty clay. 
Consistence: hard or very hard when dry
Reaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline.
Rock fragment content: 15 to 90 percent by volume gravels, stones, and channers. 
Note: Where the A horizon has values of 3, the C horizon has values of 3 or less.


C horizon
Hue: 10YR or 5Y
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: Loam in conjunction with very gravelly or extremely gravelly modifiers. Silt loam in conjunction with very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or extremely channery modifiers. Clay loam in conjunction with very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very channery, or extremely channery modifiers. Silty clay loam in conjunction with very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very channery, or extremely channery modifiers.
Rock fragment content: 35 to 90 percent by volume gravels, stones, and channers.
Reaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline.
Note: Fragments of rock are gray, brown, yellow, or white. The C horizon contains pockets or fragments of an argillic horizon similar to those of the associated Alfisols. The pockets or fragments have higher chroma than the C horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kanima soils are on gently sloping valleys and very steep hills or ridges that were formed as the result of surface coal mining operations.  The long narrow hills or ridges are 20 to 100 feet higher than the narrow valleys.  Slopes ranges from 1 to 70 percent. They formed in excavated loamy material weathered from sandstone, shale, and limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 483 to 1372 mm (19 to 54 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 12.2 to 17.8 degrees C. (54 degrees to 64 degrees F).  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64.  Elevation is 198.1 to 320 m (500 to 1050 feet).  Frost free days range from 185 to 255.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bokoshe, Burwell, Carytown, Counts, Dennis, Liberal, Okemah, Parsons, Sobal, Stigler, Tamaha, Vian, Wing, and Wister series.  
Bokoshe soils have fragipans and occupy side slopes on adjacent topography. 
Burwell soils have Bt horizons and are on mounds.  
Carytown and Wing soils have natric horizons and are on adjacent topography. 
Counts, Dennis, Liberal, Okemah, Parsons, Sobal, Stigler, Tamaha, Vian, and Wister soils have Bt horizons and are on adjacent topography.  In addition, Dennis and Okemah soils have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for runoff runoff is very low to very high.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (1.4 - 14 um/s). 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for wildlife habitat, recreation, and landfills.  Vegetation on the older spoil banks is winged elm, common hackberry, American sycamore, eastern cottonwood, sumac, and black locust with a sparse to moderate understory of grasses, legumes, and weeds.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112), Arkansas Valley and Ridges (MLRA 118) and Ouachita Mountains (MLRA 119).  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Haskell County, Oklahoma; 1972.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as a land type named Mine pits and dumps.  These soils are the spoil banks that were formed as the result of surface mining for coal.  The surface mines were worked with equipment such as bulldozers and drag lines.

Diagnostic horizon and features in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches).
Base saturation is more than 35 percent.
