KNEFF SERIES

The Kneff series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified loamy and silty lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, semiactive, frigid Oxyaquic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kneff very fine sandy loam, on a 3 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Bt2--58 to 74 cm (23 to 29 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam; strong coarse angular blocky structure; firm; common very fine and fine roots; many faint dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 inches).]

 C--74 to 155 cm (29 to 61 inches); stratified brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, silt loam, silty clay, and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) very fine sandy loam; massive; few fine roots in the upper 30 cm (12 inches); common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; few fine prominent gray (5Y 6/1) and gray (5YR 6/1) iron depletions throughout; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline. [76 to 140 cm (30 to 55 inches) thick]

 2C--155 to 203 cm (61 to 80 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand with strata 6 mm to 15 cm (1/4 to 6 inches) thick of brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam and pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam; single grain; loose; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized throughout; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kneff soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in stratified loamy and silty lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 150 days. Elevation is 183 to 366 meters (600 to 1,200 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Bowers soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Deerheart soils which form a drainage sequence with the Kneff soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. This soil has a seasonal high water table that is perched at the interface of the stratified material. Depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between October and May in normal years. The soil is saturated in one or more layers within 30 inches of the surface, for one month or more in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for cropland, pasture and woodland. Native vegetation includes sugar maple, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American basswood, paper birch, white spruce, and balsam fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northeastern lower Michigan. The series is of small extent.
