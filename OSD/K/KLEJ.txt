MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monmouth County, New Jersey, 1946

REMARKS:  The type location site was moved to Sussex County, DE.  Klej soils were not correlated in the update survey Queen Annes County, MD, the previous type location.  Inherently these soils have a low base status.  Undisturbed pedons in wooded areas commonly have a microsequence of an A, E, and Bh horizon (micro-podzol).  Total thickness of the A, E, and Bh horizons is less than 6 inches and individual Bh horizons are less than 2 inches thick.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 4 to 14 inches (A, Bh and E horizons)
