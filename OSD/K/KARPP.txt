KARPP SERIES

The Karpp series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash over alluvium derived mainly from limestone.  Karpp soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Karpp silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered by 5 percent gravel.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 18 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 15 cm thick)

    2Bk--18 to 30 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 23 cm thick)

    2Bkq--30 to 38 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) very gravelly silt loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive, hard, friable; slightly sticky and nonplastic; few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent durinodes; 50 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 23 cm thick)

    2Bkqm--38 to 104 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) duripan, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive with a thin continuous laminar cap; extremely hard, extremely firm; indurated by secondary silica; strongly effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; about 30 feet north of the road across Cedar Ridge; about 960 feet south and 750 feet west of the northeast corner of section 6, T. 29 N., R. 55 E.; USGS Cedar Ridge 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 25 minutes 47 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 48 minutes 59 seconds W; NAD 83 Decimal Degrees 40.4297222 latitude and -115.8163888 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry from June to October; aridic moisture regime that borders xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature 9 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 36 to 50 cm.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.  The upper 2 to 8 cm is noneffervescent in some pedons.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 55 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are limestone and detached pieces of duripan.

A horizons  
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; the value is 6 dry when the upper 18 cm of the soil are mixed.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

2Bk horizon and 2Bkq horizon (when present)  
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 10 percent.
Salinity (EC): 0 to 2 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 0 to 12.
Other features:  Some pedons have up to 20 percent durinodes.

2Bqkm horizon  
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Cementation class:  Indurated or very strongly cemented.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blackcan, Gravden, Gunnel, Jericho, Lien, and Rekima series.

Blackcan are moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms. Gravden soils average 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Gunnel soils have calcic horizons.  Jericho soils average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have calcic horizons.  Lien soils have duripans at depths of 15 to 36 cm.  Rekima soils have cambic horizons and have lithic contacts between 43 to 50 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Karpp soils are on fan remnants and ballenas.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash over alluvium derived mainly from limestone.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,740 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chiara, Rad, and Wieland soils.  Chiara soils are loamy and shallow to duripans.  Rad soils are coarse-silty, very deep, and have cambic horizons.  Wieland soils are fine, very deep, and have argillic horizons and horizons with firm, brittle matrix.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Karpp soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is Utah juniper and Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 9,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 25.
