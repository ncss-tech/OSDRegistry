MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wayne County, North Carolina; 1969.

REMARKS: Classification was changed from Entisols to Inceptisols (9/98) to correspond with the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 1 to 13 inches (A and Ag horizons)
Cambic horizon--the zone from 13 to 49 inches (Bg horizon)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches
