KATKITOS SERIES

The Katkitos series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from metasedimentary rock. These soils are on cirque platforms. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 1,475 mm, and average annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial, amorphic Lithic Haplocryands

TYPICAL PEDON: Katkitos medial loam, in a mosaic of meadows and open forest. This profile was described on a 12 percent slope at 2,185 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 12 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) medial loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw--12 to 28 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly medial loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

    2R--28 cm; hard metasedimentary rock.

COMPETING SERIES:
CIIMAQ (AK) - have pH values less than 5.2
TREEN (WA) - does not have a cambic horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - cirque platforms
Elevation - 1,800 to 2,400 meters
Slope - 0 to 15 percent
Parent material - volcanic ash over residuum derived from metasedimentary rock 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; short warm summers 
Mean annual precipitation - 1,200 to 2,000 mm 
Mean annual air temperature - 0.0 to 4.0 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; 5 to 15 um/sec.

USE AND VEGETATION: Katkitos soils are used mainly for recreation and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is dominated by alpine aster, sitka valerian, Hitchcock's wood rush, subalpine fir, glacier lilies, broadleaf arnica, Drummond's rush, alpine bluegrass and shortstalk sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Katkitos soils are of small extent in northwestern Montana. MLRA 43A and 43B.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Glacier National Park area in Glacier County, Montana, 2015. The series name is derived from a local landmark. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:
Andic soil properties - from 0 to 28 cm (A, Bw horizons)
Cambic horizon - from 12 to 28 cm (Bw horizon)
Lithic contact - at 28 cm (2R horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 0 to 28 cm (A, Bw horizons)

Kitkitos soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic moisture regime.
