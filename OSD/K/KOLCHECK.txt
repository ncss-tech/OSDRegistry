KOLCHECK SERIES

The Kolcheck series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from quartzite, with minor amounts of limestone. Kolcheck soils are in depressions on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: At present there no series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kolcheck soils are in broad linear depressions on mountains. They formed in colluvium derived mainly from quartzite, with minor amounts of limestone. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 2,130 to 2,950 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brokit, Cooperwash, and Successloop series. Brokit soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size control section with 12 to 20 percent clay in the upper part and 3 to 10 percent clay in the lower part. Cooperwash soils are well drained, have mollic epipedons that are 80 to 150 cm thick, and have Btkss horizons. Successloop soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Episaturation is present during spring and early summer that saturates the profile through the upper 50 to 75 cm. The profile appears wet:nonsatiated below the saturated zone. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Kolcheck soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Present vegetation is slender wheatgrass, Letterman's needlegrass and silver sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 28B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: White Pine County, Humboldt National Forest, Nevada, South part, 2013. The name is from a local geographic feature.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 50 cm (A1, A2 and Bt1 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 23 to 152 cm (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons).
