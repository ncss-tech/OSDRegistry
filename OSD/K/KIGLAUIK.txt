TYPICAL PEDON: Kiglauik silt loam - on a 35 slope at willow/mixed grass-forb scrub. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi--0 to 1 inch; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) slightly decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear wavy boundary.

	A--1 to 4 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; 40 percent mica flakes in the fine earth fraction; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

	2ABw--4 to 17 inches; dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) very channery loam; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; 45 percent channers, 10 percent flagstones; 50 percent mica flakes in the fine earth fraction; slightly acid (pH 6.3); gradual wavy boundary.

	2C--17 to 32 inches; black (5Y 2.5/2) extremely channery loam; friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 65 percent channers, 5 percent flagstones; 50 percent mica flakes in the fine earth fraction; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual smooth boundary.

	2Cr--32 to 60 inches; fractured bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: solifluction lobes on mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly cryoturbate derived from schist
Elevation: 381 to 2228 feet
Slope: 5 to 45 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 27 inches
Annual temperature: 23 to 25 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Boldrin, Sinuktuk and Tuksuk soils. Boldrin soils are very poorly drained, shallow to moderately deep to permafrost and occur on mountain footslopes and toeslopes. Sinuktuk soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and occur on mountains. Tuksuk soils are very poorly drained moderately deep to bedrock, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loess mantle and high in the gravelly colluvium.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is willow/mixed grass-forb scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Steward River Training Area, Alaska, 2005

REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include:
Lithic contact: 32 inches. (R horizon)
Mollic epipedon: 0.5 to 17 inches. (A and 2ABw horizons)
Loamy-skeletal particle size control section: 10 to 32 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA:

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
