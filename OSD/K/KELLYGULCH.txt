KELLYGULCH SERIES 

The Kellygulch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from granite bedrock. These soils are on bedrock-floored plains, hills, ridges, divides, mountains, and escarpments. Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kellygulch coarse sandy loam, in forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. 

    A--5 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine, and few medium pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick) 

    Bw--18 to 38 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 36 cm thick) 

    BC--38 to 69 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 36 cm thick) 

    Cr--69 to 79 cm; pale olive (5Y 6/3) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly coarse sand or loamy coarse sand; neutral (pH 7.0). (10 to 38 cm thick) 

    R--79 cm; hard granite bedrock.
