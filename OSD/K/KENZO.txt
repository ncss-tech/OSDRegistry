KENZO SERIES

The Kenzo series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, and eolian sand. Kenzo soils are on structural benches and escarpments on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Kenzo cobbly loamy sand in rangeland. The surface is covered with 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 3 percent stones.

       A--0 to 4 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) cobbly loamy sand, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and few fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick).

       C--4 to 11 inches; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) cobbly sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 18 inches thick)

       R--11 inches; Kayenta Formation sandstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bigmon (CO), Hideout (UT), Lazear (CO), Redspear (WY), Rizno (UT), Rizozo (NM), Simel (UT), Skyvillage (NM), Tesihim (AZ), Travessilla (NM), Travson (WY), and Zukan (UT) series.
Bigmon soils depth to paralithic contact (where present): 5 to 8 inches (13 to 20 cm) to weathered sandstone overlying a lithic contact. 
Hidout, Skyvillage, Tesihim, Travessilla, and Travson soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower. 
Lazear soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR or and more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 
Rizno soils particle size control section is dominated by channers. 
Simel has greater than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section. Redspear and Zukan soils have Bw and Bk horizons. 
Rizozo soils have less than 25 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: residuum and eolian sand 
Landform: structural bench, and escarpments on structural benches 
Slopes: 2 to 60 percent 
Elevation: 4,200 to 7,000 feet 
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 52 degrees F (7 to 10.5 degrees C) 
Mean annual precipitation: 9 to 12 inches (229 to 305 mm) 
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kenzo, Arches, Begay, Simel, and Mido soils. Kenzo soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Arches soils have a sandy particle-size control section. Begay soils are more than 60 inches deep. Mido soils are more than 60 inches deep and have a sandy particle-size control section. Simel soil contains 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, very low to medium runoff, moderate and moderately rapid permeability 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Potential vegetation is Utah juniper, green mormontea, broom snakeweed, roundleaf buffaloberry, two-needle pinyon, Indian ricegrass, and galleta. These soils have been correlated to the Semidesert Shallow Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) 035XY221UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.  Also a steep phase has been correlated to Semidesert Steep Shallow Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) 035XY240UT ecological site in the soil survey area (Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah. LRR D, MLRA 35. This series is of small extent.
