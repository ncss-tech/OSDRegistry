KINDT SERIES

The Kindt series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from shale bedrock. These soils are on hillslopes, fan aprons and fan remnants. Slopes are 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Gypsic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kindt clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

     A--0 to 7 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), moist; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; 5 percent parachanners and 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 cm thick)                                                       

     Bk--7 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) parachannery clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3), moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; 20 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; 30 percent parachanners; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 50 cm thick).     

     BCky--30 to 75 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very parachannery clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; few very fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; 5 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; 10 percent irregular gypsum masses in matrix; 50 percent parachanners; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); gradual smooth boundary. (25 to 45 cm thick).     

     Cr--75 cm; shale bedrock.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: none listed.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained, Ksat 1.5 to 15.0 um/sec.

USE AND VEGETATION: Kindt soils are primarily used for rangeland. The potential native vegetation is Wyoming big sage, Gardner's saltbush, shadscale saltbush, horsebrush, birdfoot sagebrush, shrubby buckwheat, Indian ricegrass, stemless mock goldenweed, winterfat, spiny phlox, and pricklypear. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kindt soils are of small extent in southwestern Wyoming. MLRA 34A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Carbon County, Wyoming, 2015. The series name is derived from a local landmark. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - 0 to 7 cm (A horizon)
Calcic horizon - 7 to 30 cm (Bk horizon) 
Gypsic horizon - 30 to 75 cm (BCky horizon)
Paralithic contact - 75 cm (Cr horizon)
Particle-size control section - 25 to 75 cm (Bk, BCky horizons)

Kindt soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
