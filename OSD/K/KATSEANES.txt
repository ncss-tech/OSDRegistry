KATSEANES SERIES

The Katseanes series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced by valley side alluvium.  Katseanes soils are on basalt plains and hills.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Katseanes silt loam - on west-facing slope of 6 percent under sagebrush and grass at 5,790 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described the soil was moist below 8 inches.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; parting to moderate fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent basalt pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; common medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular roots; 5 percent pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; common medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent basalt pebbles, moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt2--13 to 17 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 10 percent basalt cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.7); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    2R--17 inches; vesicular basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Fremont County, Idaho; about 1 mile west of Fogg Butte; 1,720 feet west 800 feet south of northeast corner sec. 11, T.10N., R.40E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mollic epipedon thickness - 10 to 13 inches
Depth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches
Particle size control section - 19 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments
Depth to argillic horizon - 7 to 10 inches
Average annual soil temperature - 39 to 43 degrees F
Average summer soil temperature - 55 to 58 degrees F

A horizon
value - 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist 5
chroma - 2 or 3, dry or moist
Reaction - strongly acid to slightly alkaline

B horizon
value, dry - 4 or 5
value, moist - 3 or 4
chroma - 2 through 4, dry or moist
Texture - silt loam or loam
Reaction - moderately acid to slightly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Carbol, Chittum, and Gilispie series.  Carbol soils are gravelly sandy clay loam with a large proportion of medium to very coarse, angular granitic sands with flat bearing surfaces.  Chittum soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Gilispie soils are gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam with 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments and have average annual soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Katseanes soils are on basalt plains and hills at elevations of 5,000 to 6,900 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  These soils have formed in loess influenced by valley side alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches.  Most of this precipitation comes in the winter and spring months.  Average annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crystalbutte, Nayrib, Pinebutte, and Vadnais soils.  Crystalbutte soils have volcanic cinders within the control section and have residual clays.  Nayrib soils are very shallow and lack an argillic horizon.   Pinebutte soils have a calcic horizon and are deep.  Vadnais soils are moderately deep and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  These soils are of moderate extent in southeast Idaho.
