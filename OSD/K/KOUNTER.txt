KOUNTER SERIES 

The Kounter series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on dissected bedrock floored plains, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kounter very cobbly coarse sandy loam, very bouldery, in rangeland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent cobbles and 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--2 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent cobbles and 30 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; few faint lime coatings on undersides of fragments; slighlty effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bk--7 to 14 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent cobbles and 35 percent pebbles; common fine masses and threads of lime, common distinct lime coatings around fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). (6 to 10 inches thick) 

    Cr--14 to 17 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to loamy coarse sand. (2 to 6 inches thick) 

    R--17 inches; hard light gray (10YR 7/1) granite bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kounter soils are primarily used for rangeland, woodland and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, sedges, fringed sagewort, mahognany, bitterbrush and Rocky Mountain juniper.  Areas in woodland have a thin overstory of Douglas-fir and limber pine, and an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Rocky Mountain juniper and sumac. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kounter soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT3052.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the surface to 7 inches (A and Bw horizons); a particle size control section from the surface to 14 inches (A, Bw and Bk horizons); a calcic horizon from 7 to 14 inches (Bk horizon); a layer of decomposed granite (grus) from 14 to 17 inches (Cr horizon); hard granite bedrock at 17 inches (R horizon).  Kounter soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
