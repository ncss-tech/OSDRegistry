KALEETAN SERIES

The Kaleetan series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with colluvium
from andesite, breccia, and glacial till.  Kaleetan soils are on glacially modified mountain back slopes at
elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about
110 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 35 to 60 percent by volume.
Average annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist
or dry.

The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR moist or dry and is variegated.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam or
gravelly loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent by volume.

The 2Bs and 2BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4
through 6 moist or dry.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam.  Rock fragments range from
35 to 60 percent by volume.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.

It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Melakwa series and the similar Cupples, Danforth, Littlejohn, Oakes, Olomount,
Philippa, Pitcher, Rinker, Sorensen, and Winnecook soils.  All of these soils except Melakwa soils have a ratio
of free iron to organic carbon of more than 0.2.  Melakwa soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kaleetan soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes range

from 8 to 65 percent.  The Kaleetan soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with colluvium from andesite,
breccia, or till.  The climate is marine influenced with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.
Average annual precipitation ranges from 90 to 130 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F,
mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The
frost-free season is 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blethen, Nagrom, Marblemount, Playco, Teneriffe, and the
competing Melakwa and Philippa soils.  Blethen soils are mesic.  Marblemount soils are sandy-skeletal and
moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Nagrom and Playco soils are cryic.  Teneriffe soils are sandy-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained except the till substratum phase is moderately well drained, moderate
permeability, slow to medium runoff.  Pedons underlain by dense glacial till have a perched water table at a
depth of 3 to 5 feet at times from November through March.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for timber production, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is Douglas-fir,
western hemlock, western redcedar and red alder with an understory of salal, Oregon-grape, western swordfern,
red huckleberry, deer fern, Pacific trillium, vine maple, longtube twinflower, and western brackenfern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western slopes of the Cascade Mountains, in west central Washington.  Series is of
moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Snoqualmie Pass Area, King County, Washington, 1986.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral
surface to 1.5 inches and a spodic horizon from 1.5 to 2.3 inches.  The upper part (4 to 9 inches) is formed in
volcanic ash and based on data from the Altapeak, Index, and Klapatche series is assumed to have a ratio of
free iron to organic carbon of less than 0.2 and more than 0.6 percent organic carbon in the upper 12 inches of
the spodic horizon.
