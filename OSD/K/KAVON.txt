KAVON SERIES

The Kavon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till and colluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on hillsides.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, subactive, frigid Xeric Palehumults

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kavon extremely gravelly loam - on an east-facing slope of 20 percent under rangeland vegetation at 2,265 meter elevation.  When described on August 20, 1981, the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 60 percent gravel, 3 percent boulders; extremely acid (pH 4.2); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 30 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; extremely acid (pH 4.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (13 to 28 cm thick)

    Bt1--30 to 51 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 50 percent gravel; extremely acid (pH 4.4); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 50 cm thick)

    Bt2--51 to 99 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 50 percent gravel; extremely acid (pH 4.2); clear smooth boundary.  (38 to 89 cm thick)

    Bt3--99 to 157 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; extremely acid (pH 4.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  The Buckpeak series in a closely related family has a fine-loamy particle-size control section and a mesic soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kavon soils are on hillsides.  The slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till and colluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,075 to 2,350 meters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 510 to 640 mm.  The average annual temperature is 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C.  The frost free season is 20 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dehana, Hogmalat, Keman, and Rutherford soils.  Dehana soils are fine-loamy.  Hogmalat soils are shallow to bedrock, and occur on summit shoulders.  Keman soils occur on summit backslopes, and have 60 to 70 percent base saturation in the upper 40 inches. Rutherford soils are moderately deep to bedrock, and occur on ridgetops and dipslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, rapid runoff; moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kavon soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is western needlegrass, slender wheatgrass, and snowbrush ceanothus.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kavon soils are of small extent in south central Idaho.
