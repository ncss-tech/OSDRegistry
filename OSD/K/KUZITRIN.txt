TYPICAL PEDON: Kuzitrin silt loam - on a slope of 10 percent under willow/mixed grass-forb scrub. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oe--0 to 1 inch; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moderately decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine, common medium and few coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary.

        A--1 to 3 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and few coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.1); clear wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Castnot series. Castnot series have spodic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: swales on mountains, swales on till plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly till
Elevation: 531 to 722 feet
Slope: 0 to 16 percent
Annual precipitation: 24.1 to 25.0 inches
Annual temperature: 24.8 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Dirrant, Imuruk, and Tisuk soils. Dirrant soils are very poorly drained, shallow to permafrost, and occur on till plains. Imuruk soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on outwash plains. Tisuk soils are well drained, very deep, and occur on hills, mountains, and till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is willow/mixed grass-forb scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
