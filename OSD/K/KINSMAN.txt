KINSMAN SERIES

The Kinsman series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in coarse and moderately coarse textured glacial outwash. These soils are on slightly concave areas of stream terraces, kame terraces, outwash plains, and depressions at the base of glaciated upland hills. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high throughout. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, isotic, frigid Typic Endoaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Kinsman sand, forested, with the surface covered by a 2 inch layer of sphagnum fibers. (Colors are for moist soil.)

    Oa -- 0 to 13 cm; black (N 2/0) broken face and rubbed sapric material; about 20 percent fiber, 10 percent rubbed; weak medium platy structure; friable; many fine and medium and common coarse roots; extremely acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick.)

    E -- 13 to 20 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sand; massive; very friable; many medium roots; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick.)

    Bh -- 20 to 25 cm; black (5YR 2/1) loamy sand; weak moderate granular structure; friable; few medium roots; very strongly acid; abrupt broken boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick.)

    Bhs -- 25 to 43 cm; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) sand; massive; very friable; few coarse prominent very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) areas of iron depletion; strongly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick.)

    Bs -- 43 to 51 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) sand; massive; very friable; common medium distinct very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) areas of iron depletion; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 38 cm thick.)

    BCg -- 51 to 61 cm; olive gray (5Y 4/2) sand; massive; very friable; common medium distinct olive (5Y 5/3) masses of iron accumulation; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick.)

    C -- 61 to 165 cm; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) gravelly sand; single grain; loose; 30 percent rounded gravel; very strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Grafton County, New Hampshire; Town of Franconia, 2 miles south of NH Routes 116 and 18, 1,500 feet east of NH Route 116. USGS Franconia, NH topographic quadrangle; Latitude 44 degrees, 12 minutes, 04 seconds N., Longitude 71 degrees, 44 minutes, 57 seconds W., NAD 1927.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 46 to 107 cm. Rock fragments of mostly gravel range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the solum and from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the substratum.

The O horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3. 

Some pedons have an Ap horizon that has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy very fine sand.

The E horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.

The Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Ortstein consistence ranges from 0 to 40 percent.

The Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 4. Ortstein consistence ranges from 0 to 40 percent.

The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Ortstein consistence ranges from 0 to 40 percent.

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.

Texture of the B and BC horizons is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Naskeag and Naumburg series. Naskeag soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Naumburg soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the solum and underlying material.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kinsman soils are on slightly concave areas of stream terraces, kame terraces, outwash plains, and depressions at the base of glaciated upland hills. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in coarse and moderately coarse textured glacial outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143mm and mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees F. The growing season ranges from 80 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Adams, Croghan, Groveton, Madawaska, Naumberg, Ondawa, Podunk, Rumney, Searsport, and Sunday soils on nearby landscapes. Adams, Croghan, Groveton, and Madawaska soils are in higher positions on the landscape and lack redoximorphic features in the spodic horizon. The competing Naumburg soils are in similar landscape positions. Searsport soils are in lower positions on the landscape and have a histic epipedon. The Sunday, Ondawa, Podunk, and Rumney soils are on floodplains and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon from 25 to 125 cm below the mineral soil surface. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high throughout.

USE AND VEGETATION: Predominantly wooded or idle. Some areas are used for growing hay or pasture.  Forested areas are in white spruce, eastern hemlock, or balsam fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: New Hampshire and Maine. MLRAs 143 and 144B. They are moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Amherst, Massachusetts.
