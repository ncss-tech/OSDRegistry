KETTLING SERIES

The Kettling series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium from meandering rivers.  Kettling soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on terraces and floodplains of river valley bottoms.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Fluventic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kettling sandy loam, located on a forested northwest facing alluvial terrace with a slope of 2 percent and an elevation of 350 meters.  When described on October 12, 2007 the soil was slightly moist throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kettling soils are found on slopes of 0 to 5 percent on terraces and floodplains of river valley bottoms at elevations from 300 to 800 meters.  They formed in alluvium from meandering rivers and are typically found where slower moving water deposited flood sediments.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 1780 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 9 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Sandalee and Torment soils.  Sandalee soils have redoximorphic features within 20 to 50 cm of the mineral soil surface.  Torment soils do not have a cambic horizon and have a seasonal water table that comes within 150 cm of the mineral soil surface for 30 or more cumulative days.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kettling soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed drainage. Native vegetation includes Douglas-fir, bigleaf maple, grand fir, vine maple, Pacific dogwood, snowberry, thimbleberry, tall Oregon grape, bracken fern, and wild ginger.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Chelan County, Washington, 2011.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Particle-size control section - 30 to 105 cm (25 to 100 cm from the mineral surface)
Umbric epipedon - 5 to 25 cm (A and Bw1 horizons)
Cambic horizon - 25 to 60 cm (Bw2 horizon)
Fluventic feature - An irregular decrease in organic carbon is assumed from the stratified alluvial parent material and periodic deposition of flood sediments. Organic carbon is also greater than 0.2 percent at a depth of 125 cm from the mineral surface.

These soils are not saturated within 100 cm of the mineral surface for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years.
