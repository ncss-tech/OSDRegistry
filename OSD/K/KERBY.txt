KERBY SERIES

The Kerby series consists of deep, well and moderately well
drained soils that formed in mixed stream alluvium.  Kerby soils
are on low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.
The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean
annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haploxerepts

Typical Pedon:  Kerby loam, forested.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

Ap--0 to 4 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) loam, brown (7.5YR
4/3) dry; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard,
friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.1);
abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

A--4 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, yellowish brown
(10YR 5/4) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure;
slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;
many fine and very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

BA--7 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, yellowish brown
(10YR 5/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure;
slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;
many fine and very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

Bw1--18 to 29 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, yellowish brown
(10YR 5/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure;
hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent
gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); gradual smooth boundary.  (10
to 13 inches thick)

Bw2--29 to 40 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, yellowish brown
(10YR 5/6) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure;
hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay films; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.9); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 13 inches thick)

2C1--40 to 52 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) extremely gravelly
sandy loam; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and
nonplastic; many irregular pores; 70 percent gravel; slightly
acid (pH 6.1); gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick) 2C2--52 to 60 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)
extremely gravelly sand; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky
and nonplastic; many irregular pores; 85 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Josephine County, Oregon; about 1/2 mile south of
the town of Kerby, 500 feet east of the Illinois River and 700
feet north of the mouth of George Creek, approximately 450 feet
north and 2,425 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 9, T.
39 S., R. 8 W., Willamette Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 54
to 56 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 80
to 110 consecutive days in all parts of the control section and
moist in the winter.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.
The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick.  It is moderately or slightly
acid.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Gravel
and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent.

The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  The
structure is weak or moderate.  Gravel and cobbles range from 0
to 25 percent.  It is loam or clay loam.

The 2C horizon is stratified loam, sandy loam, and sand and has 0
to 85 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Debenger, Hohmann, Offenbacher, Shoat, Springwater, and Wamic series.  Debenger and Springwater
soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Hohmann, Offenbacher and Shoat soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Wamic soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to
52 degrees F, are neutral throughout and have a very hard or extremely hard 2C horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kerby soils are on low stream terraces and
have slope gradients of 0 to 3 percent.  The soils are at
elevations of 800 to 2,000 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium
from mixed origin.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges
from 18 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Evans, Newberg, Takilma, Camas, and Ruch soils.  Evans, Newberg, Takilma and
Camas soils have a mollic epipedon.  Evans, Newberg and Camas
soils are on associated flood plains.  Ruch soils are on
associated alluvial fans and footslopes and have an argillic
horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate
to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Pasture, hay, grain and building sites.  The native vegetation is ponderosa pine, California black oak,
Pacific madrone, common snowberry, poison oak and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Oregon.  The soils are of moderate extent.
