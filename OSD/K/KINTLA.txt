KINTLA SERIES 

The Kintla series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over till derived from metasedimentary rock.  These soils occur on lateral moraines and cirque floors. Slopes are 8 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1,200 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial-skeletal over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Haplocryands 

TYPICAL PEDON: Kintla gravelly medial loam, in coniferous forest. This profile was described on an 8 percent slope at 1,100 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 6 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter.

    A--6 to 26 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly medial loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw1--26 to 54 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly medial sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bw2--54 to 67 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly medial loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 2 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual smooth boundary.

    2C--67 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2).
