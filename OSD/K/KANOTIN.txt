KANOTIN SERIES

The Kanotin series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying clayey lacustrine sediments on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Histic Epiaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Kanotin muck, on a 1 percent slope in an idle area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oi--0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 inches); living sphagnum moss.

 Oa1--10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches); black (5YR 2.5/1) muck (sapric material); 50 percent fiber, 10 percent rubbed; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

 Oa2--20 to 33 cm (8 to 13 inches); black (N 2.5/) muck (sapric material); 25 percent fiber, 5 percent rubbed; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Oa horizon is 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches).]

 E--33 to 40 cm (13 to 16 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sand, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; single grain; loose; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [2 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 C--127 to 140 cm ( 50 to 56 inches); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sand; single grain; loose; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 25 cm (10 inches) thick]

 Ab--140 to 157 cm ( 56 to 62 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) stratified very fine sand and silt loam; massive; friable; few fine faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) manganese masses; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 18 cm (7 inches) thick]

 2C--157 to 213 cm ( 62 to 84 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay; massive; very firm; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kanotin soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Kanotin soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying clayey lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pullup, Proper, McIvor, and Wabun soils. The somewhat excessively drained Pullup soils and the moderately well drained Proper soils are on ridges. The somewhat poorly drained McIvor soils are in slightly higher landscape positions. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Wabun soils are in depression and drainageways. Wabun soils do not have spodic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (one foot) above the surface to 30 cm (one foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. The soil is saturated for a period of 90 to 120 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy material and moderately low in the underlying clayey sediments. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy material and slow in the underlying clayey sediments.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is covered with wetland brush with few trees scattered throughout. Ground cover includes water tolerant grasses and sedges, leatherleaf, sheep laurel, bog rosemary, labrador tea, and sphagnum moss. Trees that are found are jack pine, tamarack, black spruce, balsam fir, and quaking aspen.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northeastern part of the lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
