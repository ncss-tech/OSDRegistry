KIRO SERIES

The Kiro series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils in old channels and depressions on flood plain steps. They formed in clayey alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Kiro silty clay - in depression. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

 A1--0 to 8 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 A2--8 to 17 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.

 A3--17 to 28 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. 

 A4--28 to 41 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1), silty clay, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; slightly alkaline; thin strata of pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam; common smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of A horizons is 30 to 45 inches.)

 AC--41 to 53 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redoximorphic concentrations; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 15 inches thick) 

 2C--53 to 70 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; thin strata of very fine sand; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Shawnee County, Kansas; about 4.5 miles east of Rossville; 2,540 feet west and 100 feet south of the southeast corner of sec. 17, T. 11 S., R. 15 E. U.S.G.S. Topeka Topographic Quadrangle lat. 39 degrees 12 minutes 5 seconds N. and long. 96 degrees 9 minutes 54 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Bellcreek, Bigmeadow, Blend, Brinker, Dunning, and Saranac series. 
Bellcreek soils have sands below 60 inches.
Blender soils have a buried A horizon at a depth of 24 to 36 inches. 
Bigmeadow and Brinker soils are calcareous. 
Brinker soils are formed in alluvium that is strongly influenced by diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash in lacustrine sediments. 
Dunning and Saranac soils have mixed mineralogy. Saranac soils have carbonates between 18 to 72 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: clayey alluvium
Landform:  old channels and depressions on floodplain steps
Slopes:  0 to 1 percent; plane to slightly concave
Elevation:  760 to 1040 feet
Mean annual temperature: 54 to 57 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 34 to 40 inches
Precipitation pattern: udic
Frost-free period: 170 to 190 days.
Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index: 55 to 70.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belvue, Bismarckgrove, Bourbonais, Chase, Eudora, Kimo, Muscotah, Reading, Rossville, Stonehouse, Wabash and Zeandale soils. Belvue, Bismarckgrove, Bourbonais, Eudora, and Stonehouse soils are on the same flood plain levels, but in a slightly higher position. 
Belvue and Eudora soils are coarse-silty. 
Bourbonais soils are coarse-silty over sandy. 
Bismarckgrove soils are fine-silty and sit somewhat higher on the landscape. 
Stonehouse soils are sandy. 
Kimo soils are clayey over loamy. 
Eudora, Muscotah, Reading, Rossville, Stonehouse, and Wabash soils are also on a adjacent higher floodplain level. 
Reading, and Rossville soils are fine-silty. 
Chase, Muscotah, and Wabash soils are fine family. 
Chase and Muscotah soils are somewhat poorly drained. 
Wabash soils are poorly drained.
Zeandale soils have secondary carbonates throughout.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage: Somewhat poorly
Runoff: slow to very slow
Permeability: slow
Flooding: Rare or Occasional
Duration: Brief
Months: March to July

USE AND VEGETATION: Most Kiro soils are not cultivated. Native vegetation is wetland with deciduous trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 106: Kiro soils occur along the Kansas River in northeast Kansas. The acreage is of very limited extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES PROPOSED: Shawnee County, Kansas, 1999.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as Kimo soils, depressional in Shawnee County, Kansas. Pedon used is 99KS177001 (SS1832 -SS1837). Lab data was run at the Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory in Manhattan, Kansas.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (A2, A3, A4, horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 16 to 42 inches.  (A1, A2, A3, A4 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: In the zone from 23 to 42 inches. (A2, A3, AC horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2C horizon. Between 40 to 60 inches.
