KISMETPEAK SERIES

The Kismetpeak series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum weathered from sandstone.   These soils are on escarpments, hills, mountain slopes, pediments and structural benches.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 650 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kismetpeak loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 11 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw--11 to 43 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick)

    C--43 to 71 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) sand, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) moist; 10 percent medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and 10 percent medium faint light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) mottles; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick)

    Cr--71 cm; very weakly cemented sandstone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - escarpments, hills, mountain slopes, pediments, structural benches
Elevation - 2195 to 2530 meters
Slope - 4 to 70 percent
Parent Material - slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock over residuum weathered from sandstone 
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 600 to 820 mm with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring
Mean annual air temperature - 0.5 to 1.5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained and rapid permeability to a paralithic contact.

USE AND VEGETATION: Kismetpeak soils are primarily used for forest land.  The potential native vegetation is mainly lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, elk sedge and pinegrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kismetpeak soils are of small extent in southwestern Wyoming. MLRA - 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES PROPOSED: Sublette County, Wyoming, 2011.  The series name is derived from a local landmark.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 11 cm (A horizon)
Cambic horizon - from 11 to 43 cm (Bw horizon)
Paralithic contact - at 71 cm (Cr horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 71 cm (part of Bw, C horizons).

Kismetpeak soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic moisture regime.
