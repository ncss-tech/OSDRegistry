KIBBIE SERIES

The Kibbie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains, ground moraines, outwash plains, and deltas. They formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kibbie loam, on a 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 cm (7 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 E--18 to 28 cm (7 to 11 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 Bt1--28 to 48 cm (11 to 19 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine roots; few lenses of very fine sand 3 to 25.4 mm (1/8- to 1-inch) thick; thin clay films on faces of peds and in root channels; common medium faint brown (10YR 4/3) iron depletions in the matrix; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--48 to 86 cm (19 to 34 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; thin lenses of very fine sand and silt loam; thin clay films on faces of peds and in some root channels; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 20 to 86 cm (8 to 34 inches).)

 C--86 to 152 cm (34 to 60 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) stratified silt loam, fine sand and very fine sand; massive; friable; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; many medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Lapeer County, Michigan; about 9 miles east and 2 1/2 miles north of North Branch; 760 feet east and 420 feet north of the southwest corner of the southeast quarter of sec. 23, T. 10 N., R. 12 E.; USGS Marlette topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees 16 minutes 17.68 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 1 minute 35.99 seconds W., WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: typically 71 to 107 cm (28 to 42 inches) but ranges from 61 to 122 cm (24 to 48 inches)
Depth to carbonates: typically 71 to 107 cm (28 to 42 inches) but ranges from 61 to 122 cm (24 to 48 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 18 to 35 percent clay
Rock fragment content: 0 to 1 percent

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3, 5 or less dry
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand
Rock fragment content: 0 to 1 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

E horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand
Rock fragment content: 0 to 1 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

Bt horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam; thickness and sequence of strata of silt loam, fine sandy loam, fine sand, and very fine sand are variable within short horizontal distances
Rock fragment content: 0 to 1 percent
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral, and includes slightly alkaline in the lower part

Some pedons have a BC or BCg horizon. Some pedons have Bk horizons with colors and textures similar to that of the C horizon.

C or Cg horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: thickness and sequence of layers of different textures vary within short horizontal distances; strata are dominantly silt loam to fine sand and range in thickness from 6 mm to more than 38 cm (1/4 to more than 15 inches); in some pedons strata 6 mm to 8 cm (1/4 to 3 inches) thick ranging from clay to loamy sand or fine sand are in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon
Rock fragment content: 0 to 1 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Silty clay loam and clay loam till is below 102 cm (40 inches) in some pedons. Sandy substratum phases that have sand or fine sand below 102 cm (40 inches) are presently. These sandy substratum phases may have stratified silt loam to sand between the solum and sandy substratum. See REMARKS.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alida, Ashippun, Lourdes, Marker, Montmorenci, and Symco series. Alida, Ashippun, Lourdes, Marker, Montmorenci, and Symco soils contain more than 1 percent rock fragments in some part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kibbie soils are on lake plains, ground moraines, outwash plains, and deltas of Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Kibbie soils formed in stratified loamy and silty glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The poorly drained or very poorly drained Colwood, the well drained Sisson, and the moderately well drained Tuscola soils are in a drainage sequence with Kibbie soils. Conover and Metamora soils are associated where deltas and outwash plains grade into till plains. The Del Rey and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Lenawee soils are associated on lake plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) below the surface from November to May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, small grains, beans, and hay are the principal crops. A small part is in permanent pasture or in woodland. Native vegetation is forests of American elm, American beech, red maple, and American basswood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 95A, 95B, 96, 97, 98, 99, and 111B in southern Michigan, southeastern Wisconsin, and northwestern Ohio. The series is of large extent.
