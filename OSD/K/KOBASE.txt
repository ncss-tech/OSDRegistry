KOBASE SERIES

The Kobase series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale and sandstone, or glaciofluvial or glaciolacustrine deposits.  They are on till plains, lake plains, stream terraces, alluvial fans, drainageways, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hill County, Montana, 1994.  Kobase is a coined name.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0106, MT0892.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); cambic horizon - from 7 to 15 inches (Bw horizon); accumulations of lime - from 15 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bky horizons); particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, Bk1, Bk2, Bky horizons).  Kobase soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
