KEAMOKU SERIES

The Keamoku series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ashfields deposited on basic `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 1,400 millimeters (55 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial-skeletal, amorphic, isomesic Typic Hapludands

TYPICAL PEDON: Keamoku medial silt loam, 4 percent slope on `a`a lava under koa trees and a grass understory.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on 4/22/98, the soil was slightly moist throughout.  The soil temperature was 15 degrees C {59 degrees F.} at a depth of 38 centimeters {15 inches}.  All textures are "apparent field textures".  pH was measured using organic dyes.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Keamoku soils are on Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea volcano `a`a flows mainly 3,000 to 10,000 years old.  On Mauna Kea, ages of lava flows may be as old as 30,000 years old.  They occur at elevations of 1,220 to 1,645 meters (4,000 to 5,400 feet).  Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is 1,270 to 2,032 millimeters (50 to 80 inches), about 75 percent of which of falls between October and April.  The mean annual pan evaporation: 1,270 to 1,525 millimeters (50 to 60 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: On Mauna Loa, these are the Alahapa, Haa and Oneula soils.  Alahapa soils are fragmental and have accretionary lapili from base surge deposits.  Haa soils are medial (non-skeletal).  Oneula soils are sandy-skeletal.  On Mauna Kea this is Laumaia.  Laumaia soils are non-skeletal soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Runoff is low.  Permeability is rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation for grazing.  Vegetation is koa (Acacia koa), ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), prickly Florida blackberry (Rubus argutus), pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), brackenfern (Pteridium aquilinum) and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils occur within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and surrounding ranches as well as windward slopes of Mauna Kea along Mana road; MLRA 160.  The series is of small extent.  

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Island of Hawaii, Hawaii County, Hawaii, 2012.  Proposed 1998.  The name is from a lava flow. Okina removed in 2009.
