KENNEY SERIES

The Kenney series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These nearly level to sloping soils are on terraces in river valleys on coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1194 mm (47 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, hyperthermic Grossarenic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kenney loamy fine sand-pasture at an elevation of 76 m (250 ft).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose; common fine roots; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

    A2--20 to 127 cm-(8 to 50 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; single grain; loose; common fine roots; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    A3--127 to 158 cm (50 to 62 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy fine sand, very pale brown (10YR 8/3) dry; single grain; loose; common fine roots; few fine siliceous pebbles; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 137 to 178 cm [54 to 70 in])

    Bt1--158 to 178 cm (62 to 70 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common clay films on faces of peds; common fine siliceous pebbles; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 64 to 168 cm [25 to 66 in])

    Bt2--178 to 203 cm (70 to 80 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; common clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Waller County, TX; from the intersection of US Highway 290 and University Drive, about 0.5 mile north on University Drive to Owens Road; east about 1.4 miles on Owens Road to Fluckinger Road; north 1.2 miles to Cameron Road; about 1.1 mile west on Cameron Road; 150 south of road in pasture; Waller USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 30 degrees, 6 minutes, 4.9 seconds N; Longitude: 95 degrees, 59 minutes, 8.3 seconds W. NAD 83; UTM Easting 212268 m, UTM Northing 3333777 m, UTM Zone 15.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kuy and Portalto series in the same family. 
Kuy soils: have redder colors in the argillic horizon
Portalto soils: allows yellower colors in the argillic horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: thick beds of unconsolidated sandy loam, loamy sands, and sandy clay loam alluvium of Pleistocene age 
Landscape: River Valleys on Coastal Plains
Landform: Terraces
Slope: 0 to 8 percent
Mean annual soil temperature: 21.7 to 22.2 degrees C (71 to 72 degrees F)
Mean annual air temperature range: 19.5 to 21.7 degrees C (67 to 71 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation range: 1092 to 1397 mm (43 to 55 in)
Frost-free period: 271 to 365 days
Elevation: 13.7 to 78 m (45 to 255 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Gessner, Hockley, Snakecreek, Tabor, and Wockley series.
Gessner soils: are loamy throughout, have gray colors due to wetness, and are in depressions
Hockley and Wockley soils: are loamy throughout and are on higher positions
Snakecreek soils: are loamy throughout and are on flood plains
Tabor soils: are in a fine family and are on similar positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is very slow; rapid internal drainage.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly native pastures of species of Andropogons and Panicums.  Improved pastures are of Coastal bermudagrass and weeping lovegrass.  A few areas are cropped to peanuts, melons, and other crops.  Mixed pine and hardwood are on some areas.  Some areas of Kenney soils are mined for roadfill and construction base material.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Coastal Plain and the eastern part of the Gulf Coast Prairie of southeast Texas. Land Resource Region T; MLRA 150A; the series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Waller County, Texas; 1948.

REMARKS:  This series was formerly classified in the Regosol great soil group. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 158 to 203 cm (62 to 80 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 158 cm (0 to 62 in) (A1, A2, A3 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations: 158 to 203 cm (62 to 80 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Additional Comments:  The series type location was moved to Waller County during the Soil Data Join and Recorrelation Initiative. This move placed the series type location in a more representative area. Due to relocation of typical pedon, the competing series and geographically associated soils sections were edited.
