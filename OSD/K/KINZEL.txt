08/2016--Assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Based on data populated in NASIS for Clackamas, Marion, and Multnomah Counties, the series was reclassified as a Fulvicryand. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence and to determine if the range in glass content is appropriate. Horizonation in the typical pedon suggests that the series may classify as a Spodosol; this should be further investigated.

The soils are derived dominantly from rock of the Cascade Andesite Formation (olivine basalt and olivine-bearing andesite); however, they are derived from rock of the Columbia River Basalt Formation in some areas.

11/2000--Andic soil properties to a depth of 150 cm are based on guidelines developed from laboratory data for soils recognized in the western Oregon Cascades.

Competing series classified as Andic Cryumbrepts include the Alfir, Naxing, Saydab, and Stahl series.
