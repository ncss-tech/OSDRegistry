REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 4 to 104 cm
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 4 to 37 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 37 to 100 cm
*Andic soil properties--zone from 4 to 150 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from 4 to 150 cm

09/2023--all mineral horizons meet criteria #3 for andic soil properties in the 13th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. All pedons have third-bar bulk density low enough to also meet criteria #2 (no ash required) throughout the umbric epipedon, and some pedons meet criteria #2 throughout the profile. Clean silt grains in the A1 horizon and "variegations of 5YR in some areas" described for the A2 horizon could be evidence of podzolization. However, evidence is insufficient to reclassify to Spodosols at this time.

The soils are derived dominantly from rock of the Cascade Andesite Formation (olivine basalt and olivine-bearing andesite); however, they are derived from rock of the Columbia River Basalt Formation in some areas.

11/2000--Andic soil properties to a depth of 150 cm are based on guidelines developed from laboratory data for soils recognized in the western Oregon Cascades .
