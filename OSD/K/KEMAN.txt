KEMAN SERIES

The Keman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till and colluvium derived from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  Keman soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Keman very gravelly loam--on a west-facing slope of 3 percent under at 2,179 meters elevation--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on September 22, 1981, the soil was dry throughout.)

Angelwhine soils have mollic epipedons that are 40 to 60 cm thick.  Aspetill soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Badwater soils are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section. Blackbear, Bickmore, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Panin, Rangertaft, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep.  Booneville soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section, have mean summer soil temperature of 10 to 13 degrees C, and have thin O horizons.  Dab soils have mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 7 degrees C and have mollic epipedons that are 40 to 60 cm thick. Dailybasin and Igor soils have a ustic soil moisture regime. Delhew soils have less than 18 percent clay, are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Geemore soils have calcic horizons and horizons with secondary silica and average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Lostcannon soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Monibasin soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 8 degrees C.  Parkalley soils have mollic epipedons that are 40 to 76 cm thick, have the base of the argillic horizon between 70 and 90 cm from the soil surface, and are dominated by flagstones.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are neutral through slightly alkaline.  Redbird soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Sweetmount soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 35 to 50 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Keman soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on all slope positions.  These soils formed in till and colluvium derived from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,895 to 2,300 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 640 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 20 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Amboat, Brose, Dehana, Hogmalat, and Kavon soils and the competing Rutherford soil.  Brose and Hogmalat soils are shallow, and occur on summits and shoulders.  Amboat soils are clayey-skeletal, and occur on lower summits.  Dehana soils are not skeletal, and occur on footslopes, backslopes, and breaks.  Kavon soils are on summit footslopes, and have a base saturation of less than 15 percent.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Keman soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Columbia needlegrass, Nevada bluegrass, and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and northeastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 25.
