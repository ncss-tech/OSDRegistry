KIMBROUGH SERIES

The Kimbrough series consists of soils that are very shallow to shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, calcareous, gravelly soils that formed in moderately fine textured eolian sediments of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are typically on gently sloping plains, narrow ridges, and side slopes along draws. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, superactive, thermic, shallow Petrocalcic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kimbrough gravelly loam, in rangeland at an elevation of about 1189 m (3,900 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

     A1--0 to 5 cm (0 to 2 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; about 15 percent of the surface covered with caliche fragments; 10 percent pebble size and 5 percent cobble size calcium carbonate fragments; strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate disseminated; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. 

     A2--5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak granular and subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 20 percent pebble size and 10 percent cobble size calcium carbonate fragments; strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate is disseminated and occurs in threads and masses; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 8 to 50 cm [3 to 20 in].) 

     Bkkm--20 to 91 cm (8 to 36 in); white (N 8/) indurated layer containing a few fractures; laminar in upper part, with indurated to strongly cemented calcium carbonate with pea-shaped calcite structures (pisolites) below the laminae; becomes softer with depth; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness is 13 to 102 cm [5 to 40 in].) 

     Bkk--91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 in); white (10YR 8/1); massive; soft calcium carbonate soil material with a loam texture; 15 percent strongly cemented caliche fragments, 25 percent moderately cemented caliche fragments; most caliche fragments have a laminar cap 1 to 2 mm thick; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: An aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic. The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for more than 205 but less than 270 days, cumulative, in normal years. November through April normally are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in July through October. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 15 to 18 degrees C (59 to 64 degrees F). 
Depth to petrocalcic horizon: 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 in).
