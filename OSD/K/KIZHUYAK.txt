GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aleneva, Missak, Pasagshak, Sa, Salonie, and Yukuk series.  
Aleneva soils lack the over thickened glassy ashy surface horizon, have andic properties and a cambic horizon, are somewhat poorly to moderately well drained, have sandy-skeletal glacial outwash substratum, and occur on slightly higher land form positions.
Missak soils have thick organic horizons, lack the over thickened glassy ashy surface horizon, are very poorly drained, and occur in depressions.
Pasagshak soils lack the over thickened glassy ashy surface horizon, are somewhat poorly to moderately well drained, have sandy-skeletal control sections, and occur on slightly higher landform positions.
Sa soils have thick organic horizons, lack the over thickened glassy ashy surface horizon, are very poorly drained, and occur in depressions.
Salonie soils lack the over thickened glassy ashy surface horizon, are poorly drained, have sandy-skeletal control sections, and occur on slightly higher landform positions.
Yukuk soils lack the over thickened glassy ashy surface horizon, have andic properties and cambic horizons, have sandy-skeletal control sections, and occur on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: 
Drainage class: poorly drained
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: moderately high to very high in the C horizon, moderately high to high in the 2A, 2Bw and 3C horizons.
Permeability: moderate to very rapid in the C horizon and moderate to rapid in the 2A, 2Bw, and 3C horizons.
Runoff: negligible to very low.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
 Used mostly for grazing.  The natural vegetation consists principally of water tolerant grasses and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 220 Alexander Archipelago-Gulf of Alaska Coast. 
Extent: limited.
