5/2023--Laboratory data for geographically associated soils supports andic subgroup criteria, but epipedons fall short of criteria for andic soil properties.  

7/2016--Assumed layers with andic soil properties meet criteria 2 (no ash required) in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for those layers to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence. The Kinney series has been mapped in Clackamas, Clark, Douglas, Lane, Linn, Marion, and Skamania Counties. Ash influence has been recognized in some of these counties, but not in all of them. The series has also been mapped on granodiorite in Skamania County and as formed in till in Lane and Marion Counties. Future investigation is needed to confirm the extent of the volcanic ash influence and to determine the correct parent material. 

Climate and elevation data suggest that the Kinney series has been mapped across both mesic and frigid temperature regimes. Further investigation is needed to determine if the soils at the higher elevations should be correlated to the similar Browder series in the frigid zone.

The Gobar series is similar to the Kinney series; it should be reviewed for potential correlation into the Kinney series.
