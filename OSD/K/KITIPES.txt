KITIPES SERIES

The Kitipes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Kitipes soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kitipes gravelly fine sandy loam, on a northeast facing, convex, 4 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,903 meters.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on March 21, 1995 the soil was moist from 0 to 165 cm.  The surface is covered by 1 percent stones, 5 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abra, Bighams, Bowdish, Copeman, Creel, Darvey, Hernandez, Honlu, Kimera, Molen (T), Numa, Peachsprings and Xenmack series.   Abra soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13.3 to 14.4 degrees C.  Bighams, Creel and Xenmack soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Bowdish and Molen soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Copeman and Kimera soils have peak periods of precipitation in April through June.  Darvey soils are 24 to 35 inches deep to the calcic horizon.  Hernandez is presumed to have basalt rock fragments.  Honlu and Peachsprings soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Numa soils have a man-made thickened Ap horizon from long periods of irrigation. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from sandstone and shale
Landform:  fan remnants
Slopes:  1 to 8 percent
Elevation:  1,702 to 2,073 meters
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 10 degrees 
Mean annual precipitation:  23 to 31 cm
Precipitation pattern:  Peak periods in July through October, remainder falls evenly throughout the rest of the year
Frost-free period:  110 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Castledale (T), Colorow, Gerst, Pherson, Strych and Yatne series.  The Gerst soils are shallow, do not have a calcic horizon and are on adjacent hills.  The Strych and Yatne soils are very deep, loamy-skeletal and are on fan remnants upslope of the Kitipes soils.  The Castledale, Colorow and Pherson soils do not have a calcic horizon, are subject to flooding and are in drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, low to medium runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated cropland, grazing and wildlife habitat.  Crops include alfalfa hay, small grains and pasture.  Native vegetation consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, shadscale, fourwing saltbush, black greasewood, Utah juniper, Indian ricegrass, galleta and rabbitbrush.  Utah correlates this soil to Semidesert Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) R034XY212UT ecological site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah Desertic Basins; LRR D, MLRA 34B.  The soils of this series are of moderate extent; about 16,800 acres in Carbon and Emery Counties, Utah.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 200 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.  (parts of Bw, Bk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 12 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 12 to 41 cm.  (Bw horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 41 to 165 cm.  (Bk horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
