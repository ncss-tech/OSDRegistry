KNIPPA SERIES

The Knippa series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived from limestone.  The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces of piedmont alluvial plains below limestone hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).

Montell soils: are clayey throughout and have intersecting slickensides at depths of less than 40 inches.
Olmos and Valco soils: occur on low ridges and are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.
Rehm soils: have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.
Sabenyo soils: occur on lower terrace risers and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow.  The runoff is low on slopes of 0 to 1 percent and medium on slopes of 1 to 3 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soil is used for rangeland and cropland, both dryland and irrigated.  Under dryland operations, grain sorghums, small grains and introduced grasses are the principal crops.  Under irrigation, grain sorghums, small grain and a variety of winter truck crops are grown.  The present native grasses are red grama, threeawn, curlymesquite, bristlegrass, Hall's panicum, fall witchgrass and sideoats grama.  Woody vegetation includes mesquite, whitebrush, Texas persimmon, twisted acacia, catclaw acacia, Texas colubrina, lotebush and bluewood condalia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern and Western Rio Grande Plain MLRAs (83A and 83B) and Eastern Edwards Plateau MLRA (81C) of Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.
