KEARNS SERIES

The Kearns series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary rocks.  Kearns soils are on alluvial fans and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION:  Box Elder County, Utah; about 0.5 miles east of the Mariner Monk farm headquarters in Blue Creek Valley; approximately 660 feet west and 660 feet south of the north quarter corner of section 31, T. 12 N., R. 5 W.; USGS Lampo Junction 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 44 minutes 08 seconds north latitude and 112 degrees 27 minutes 55 seconds west longitude, NAD27; UTM zone 12N 378067E, 4621438N, NAD83.

Other features: Some pedons have texture of gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy fine sand, or very gravelly loamy fine sand at depths below 40 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Rhea, Staley, and Valby series.

Rhea: the A and Bw horizons have neutral reaction and are influenced by volcanic ash.

Staley: formed in loess, have prismatic structure, and are influenced by volcanic ash.

Valby: are moderately deep to lithic contacts (basalt).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kearns soils are on slightly convex alluvial fans and intermediate and high lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bingham, Bluffdale, Hansel, Parleys, Taylorsville, and Timpanogos soils.  Bingham, Bluffdale, Hansel, Parleys, and Timpanogos soils have argillic and calcic horizons.  Taylorsville soils have ochric epipedons and calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kearns soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland.  Crops are alfalfa, small grain, corn for silage, sugar beets, tomatoes, and dryland wheat.  In Utah this series is correlated with Upland Loam (Basin Big Sagebrush) ecological sites.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Utah and southern Idaho.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (Ap and A horizons).

Cambic horizon - The zone from 9 to 15 inches (Bw horizon).

Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 15 to 39 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons and parts of the Bw and 2Ckn horizons).


The superactive cation exchange activity class is based on CEC and clay estimates in the NASIS interpretive record along with laboratory data from Utah State University of the representative pedons of Kearns in Box Elder and Salt Lake Counties, UT.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 210-211, Table 9 of the Soil Survey of Box Elder County, Utah, Eastern Part.
