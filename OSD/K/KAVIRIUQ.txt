COMPETING SERIES: These These include Flat Horn, Kwatahein, Stainky, and Yohn soils. Flat Horn soils have stratified textures in the substratum. Kwatahein, Stainky, and Yohn soils have coarse fragments in the substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: loess
Landform: hills and lower mountain slopes
Slopes: 3 to 45 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 26 inches, 393 to 657 mm
Mean annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F., -2 to -1 C.
Frost-free season: 95 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include  Teggiuq, Nunaniq, and Sleetmut soils. Teggiuq soils are permanently frozen soils at cooler positions, Nunaniq soils are well drained soils formed in loess at lower concave and linear positions. Sleetmute soils are gravelly and occur on shoulders and noseslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for water shed. Native vegetation is paper birch and horsetail grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 230, Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands, Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
