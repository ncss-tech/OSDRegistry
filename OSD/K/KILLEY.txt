TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, acid Typic Cryaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Killey silt loam-on a 2 percent slope under forest vegetation.

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2/2) slightly decomposed plant material; many fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    A--2 to 5 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam, weak fine granular structure; very friable nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; few medium distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redoximorphic depletions; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 12 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) silt loam and few thin strata of fine sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium roots, few coarse roots; common medium distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redoximorphic depletions and common fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--12 to 28 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) and dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, and fine roots; common medium prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redoximorphic concentrations; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear smooth boundary.

    C3--28 to 38 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) fine sand and few thin strata of silt; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; very strongly acid (5.0); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches thick)

    2C4--38 to 60 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) very gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 35 percent gravel and 2 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 5.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Susitna Valley Area, Alaska; approximately 11 miles west of Talkeetna; SW 1/4, SW 1/4, section 32, T.26N., R.6W., Seward Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the underlying sandy or gravelly material: ranges from 20 to 40 inches
Upper part of the control section: strata of silt loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam strata vary in thickness and arrangement
Fine stratification: within any horizon is common
Upper part of the particle control size section (weighted average): coarse-loamy
Redoximorphic features: commonly occurs throughout the profile
Water table: 10 and 20 inches during the growing season; ranges to 40 inches in areas with altered drainage

O horizon:
Reaction class: extremely acid to strongly acid

A horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 1 to 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Reaction class: very strongly acid or strongly acid

C horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: silt loam, fine sandy loam, fine sand, stratified silt loam to fine sand
Coarse fragments: 0 to 5 percent fine gravel
Reaction class: very strongly acid or strongly acid

2C horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 3 or 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: very gravelly sand, very gravelly coarse sand
Coarse fragments: 35 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles
Reaction class: very strongly acid or strongly acid

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Sinuk (T) series in the same family. Sinuk (T) soils have a mean annual soil temperature below 32 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: very poorly drained
Parent material: stratified loamy or loamy alluvium overlying sandy and gravelly alluvium
Landform: floodplains
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature: 32 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 38 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the loamy surface layers and high to very high in the sandy and gravelly layers.  The soils are subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Sparse forest of white spruce and balsam poplar. Understory includes willows, bluejoint grass, and associated plants. Some areas are used for hay and pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands South-central Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

The Killey series now incorporates the concept of the Anchor Point series.
