KIKI SERIES

The Kiki series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that developed in alluvium and eolian deposits on knolls and ridges.  Slope is 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kiki sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A1--0 to 3 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; common fine interstitial pores; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

   A2--3 to 6 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; few fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

   Bt1--6 to 14 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; common thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

   Bt2--14 to 19 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; few clay films bridging sand grains; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

   Bk--19 to 24 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and few fine roots; violently effervescent; calcium carbonate segregated as common medium irregular soft masses; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

   2R--24 inches; basalt.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bacobi (AZ), Frisite (WY), Grazane (AZ), Griffy (WY), Neiber (WY), Papoose (NV), Redlands (CO), Saddle (WY), Starmountain (AZ) and Tijeras (NM) series.  Bacobi, Grazane, Neiber and Saddle soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Frisite, Griffy, Papoose, Redlands, Starmountain and Tijeras soils are greater than 40 inches deep.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kiki soils are on knolls and ridges.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in sediments derived from mixed alluvial and eolian material.  Elevation is 5,500 to 6,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 10 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 51 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Mack, Navajo, Shiprock and Suwanee soils.  These soils have depths greater than 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.
USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and urban development.  Principal native vegetation is galleta, rubber rabbitbrush, prickly pear and yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West central New Mexico.  The series is of small extent. MLRA 42.
