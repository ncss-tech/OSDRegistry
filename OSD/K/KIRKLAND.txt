KIRKLAND SERIES

The Kirkland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from clayey sediments over shale of Permian age. These soils are on paleoterraces on stream terraces, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 810 mm (32 in).

Pawhuska and Doolin soils: are within the same landform but, and have natric horizons
