KAMAN SERIES

The Kaman series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These nearly level soils occur on floodplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, thermic Oxyaquic Hapluderts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kaman clay--rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Bkss--132 to 203 cm, (52 to 80 in); dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; weak coarse angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common prominent slickensides; few fine black (10YR 2/1) iron-manganese nodules; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations with clear boundaries on slickenside faces; few fine calcium carbonate nodules; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Harris County, Texas; from intersection of Farm Road 2100 and U.S. Highway 90 at Crosby; 3.3 miles south on Farm Road 2100; 0.6 mile west on Highland Shores Road; 200 ft north in range. USGS topographic quadrangle: Highlands; Latitude: 29 degrees, 50 minutes, 16.8 seconds N; Longitude: 95 degrees, 4 minutes, 1.4 seconds W; Datum: WGS84.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 203 cm (80 in).  When dry, cracks 1 cm to more than 2.5 cm (1/2 to more than 1 inch) wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 30 cm (12 in).  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls about 5 to 15 cm (2 to 6 in) above the microdepressions.  Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from 1.2 to 4.6 m (4 to about 15 ft).

Soil Moisture: An udic soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is moist in some or all parts throughout the year in normal years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 20.6 to 21.7 degrees C (69 to 71 degrees F)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deann, Houston, and Moreland series in the same family. Similar soils include the Garner, Hollywood, League, Maytag, Okolona, Trinity, and Zilaboy soils.
Deann and Houston soils: have a surface horizon color yellower than 10YR
Moreland soils: are redder than 10YR in the surface horizon
Garner, Hollywood, Maytag, Okolona, and Zilaboy soils: have less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section
League soils: have less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section; in a hyperthermic soil temperature regime
Trinity soils: do not become saturated in the upper part for 20 consecutive or 30 cumulative days in a normal year

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 1219 to 1473 mm (48 to 58 in)
Precipitation Pattern: Rainfall is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the spring and fall months
Mean annual air temperature: 19.5 to 20.6 degrees C (67 to 69 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 240 to 300 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cowmarsh, Simelake, Pluck, and Zummo series. 
Cowmarsh soils: are ponded; in oxbows and old channels
Simelake soils: have less clay throughout; are lighter in color; similar landform
Pluck soils: loamy throughout; higher landform
Zummo soils: have less clay throughout; do not have slickensides; in a lower landform closer to the coast

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is high. Occasionally or frequently flooded for brief to long duration from November to June in normal years.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Forest and pasture.  Forest consists of cypress, sweetgum, elm, and water oaks.  Cleared areas are used for pastures of dallisgrass, bermudagrass, and fescuegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 152B; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Harris County, Texas; 1973.

REMARKS:  Kaman soils have a high shrink-swell potential and are wet for long periods of time. Formerly classified as Typic Pelluderts. 1/94

Diagnostic horizons and feature in this pedon are:

Deep wide cracks open and close more or less irregularly over time according to the weather.  They do not remain open for 90 cumulative days in most years.

Color-have chroma of 1.5 or less dominant in the matrix of all subhorizons in more than half of each pedon.  A moist color value of 2 or 3 is expected.
