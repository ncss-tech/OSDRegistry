KENAGA SERIES

The Kenaga series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands formed in silty colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from decomposing post-Ordivician age mudstone.  These soils are on very gently to strongly sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, mesic Aquic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON: Kenaga gravelly silt loam on a convex ridge top of 3 percent slope in a mixed hardwood forest at an elevation of 1,230 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

   Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed leaf litter.

   A--2 to 8 inches; 80 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) and 20 percent brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3), dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; friable; common fine, medium and coarse roots throughout; many fine irregular and tubular pores; 15 percent subangular chert gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

   Bt1--8 to 16 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) gravelly silt loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots and a few coarse roots throughout; many fine tubular pores; common continuous faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay films on faces of peds; few distinct discontinuous brown (7.5YR 5/3) organic coats on faces of peds; 15 percent subangular chert gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear wavy boundary.

(Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 13 to 33 inches or more)

   2Btd1--24 to 36 inches; 80 percent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) and 20 percent red (2.5YR 4/8) gravelly silty clay loam; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine platy parting to strong fine angular blocky; very firm; few fine and medium roots throughout; few fine tubular and irregular pores; many continuous distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay films on faces of peds and few continuous prominent brown (10YR 4/3) clay films between prisms; common fine distinct light gray (10YR 7/2) irregular iron depletions throughtout; 20 percent subangular chert gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); gradual smooth boundary.

   2Btd2--36 to 52 inches; 70 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and 30 percent dark red (2.5YR 3/6) gravelly clay; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine platy parting to strong fine angular blocky; very firm; very few fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; many continuous distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay films on faces of peds; 20 percent subangular chert gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); gradual smooth boundary.

   2Btd3--52 to 80 inches; 60 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) and 40 percent red (2.5YR 4/8) clay; weak fine prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky and strong fine angular blocky; very firm; very few fine roots throughout; few fine tubular pores; common discontinuous distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and few continuous prominent dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds; few fine prominent light gray (10YR 7/1) iron depletions on faces of peds; 5 percent subrounded sandstone gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.6). (Combined thickness of the 2Btd horizon is 30 inches or more)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kenaga soils are on ridge tops, shoulder slopes and side slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in silty colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from decomposing post Ordivician age mudstone. Elevations are commonly 700 to 1,500 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 45 inches.
   
GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Egyptgrove, Poynor, Scholten, Tick, and Tonti soils. All are on similar positions.  Egyptgrove soils are well drained.  Poynor soils are loamy-skeletal over clayey.   Scholten and Tonti soils have fragipans.  Tick soils are fine textured.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is medium to very high. Permeability is slow and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. A water table is present at a depth of 2 to 3 feet in most years.
   
USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for pasture, hay and timber.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks region (MLRA 116A) of Missouri and possibly Arkansas. This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Howell County, Missouri soil survey; 2004.  The name is from a hollow in the county.
   
REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches. (A horizon).
Argillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 80 inches (Bt and 2Btd horizons).
Densic properties - the zone from 24 to 80 inches (Btd horizons).
Zone where aquic conditions occur - 24 to 36 inches.

This soil is being mapped predominantly in what is believed to be the Cheltenham formation (Pennsylvanian age) in Missouri.

Sampled for the University of Missouri Soil Characterization Lab as M0009102 (Viburnum Variant).
