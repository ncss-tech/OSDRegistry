KRONQUIST SERIES

The Kronquist series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Kronquist soils are in drainageways, flood plains and basins, and around perimeters of lakes. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kronquist soils are in drainageways, basins and flood plains, and on the perimeters of lakes at elevations of 1,600 to 2,400 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. They formed in mixed alluvium, mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are in a continental climate having dry summers and cool, most winters. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Green Bluff, Hoodoo, Kramerhill, Kruse, and Spokane soils. All of these soils except Hoodoo do not have an aquic moisture regime. Green bluff soils are frigid, coarse-loamy and are on backslopes of foothills. Hoodoo soils are poorly drained, ashy, and are in drainageways and bottomlands. Kramerhill soils are fine-loamy, mesic and are on convex footslopes and backslopes of mountains and foothills. Spokane soils have a mollic epipedon, are coarse-loamy, mesic, and are on west and south-facing convex backslopes of hills. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are occasionally flooded for brief periods from January through May. An apparent water table is at its uppermost limit from February through May. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for grazing, hay, pasture, and wildlife habitat. Potential natural vegetation is tufted hairgrass, reed canarygrass, red top, sedges, reeds, rushes, willows, aspen and hawthorne. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. MLRA 44A; Series is of small extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington, 2016. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 27 inches (the A and BAt horizons) 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 27 to 55 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons) 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 27 to 47 (the Btg1 and part of the Btg2 horizon) 
Vitrandic feature - the zone from the surface to 27 inches (the A and BAt, horizons) 
An assumed irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth 
An aquic moisture regime 

Significant areas of Kronquist were previously mapped as Konner in Spokane County. Areas of Konner mapped in Stevens County will need further investigation as to their drainage class and soil temperature regime. 

Kronquist soils should be further investigated to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed)
