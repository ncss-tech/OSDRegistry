KOBEH SERIES

The Kobeh series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Kobeh soils are on inset fans, fan skirts and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Durinodic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kobeh sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent less than 1.2 cm gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 20 cm thick)

    A2--5 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw--18 to 43 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium, fine and many very fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent less than 1.2 cm gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 50 cm thick)

    Bq--43 to 61 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly light sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent hard durinodes; 30 percent 1.2 to 2.5 cm gravel; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.

    2Bk--61 to 101 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel most of which is less than 1.2 cm; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt broken boundary.  (25 to 70 cm thick)

    2C--101 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 60 percent gravel less than 1.2 cm; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 20 miles north of Eureka in Diamond Valley; about 1,400 feet south and 2,350 feet east of the northwest corner of section 8, T. 22 N., R. 53 E.; USGS Tule Dam Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 48 minutes 18 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 1 minutes 32 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.8050000 latitude, -116.0255556 longitude. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and early spring, aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist (greater than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist when the upper 18 cm are mixed).

Reaction:  Slightly acid or neutral.

Bw horizon 
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

Reaction:  Neutral through strongly alkaline.

Bq horizon
Hue:  10YR, 2.5Y.
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.

Reaction:  Neutral through strongly alkaline.
Silica cementation:  20 to 70 percent 1 to 2.5 cm hard or very hard durinodes; few to many silica bridges.  Discontinuous weak or strong cementation that is 15 to 90 cm horizontally and up to 8 cm thick occurs at the lower boundary.

Chroma:  1 through 3.
Texture:  Some pedons have strata of gravelly fine sandy loam or very gravelly fine sandy loam below 127 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family at the present time.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kobeh soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alhambra, Lone, Nayped and Silverado soils.  Alhambra soils lack cambic horizons.  Lone soils have indurated duripans.  Nayped soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections. Silverado soils are coarse-loamy and have continuous weakly silica-cemented subhorizons. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly Kobeh soils are cultivated to alfalfa hay, pasture, and small grains.  When not cultivated they are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native plants are Wyoming big sagebrush with some bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28B.
