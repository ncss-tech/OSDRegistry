COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: well
Parent material: ash influenced loess over glacial drift
Landform: moraines on till plains
Slopes: 0 to 60 percent
Climate: maritime; cool summers and long cold winters
Mean annual temperature: 34 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 25 to 40 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Mutnala, Qutal, Spenard, Redoubt, Puntilla, and Chunilna soils. Mutnala, Puntilla, and Redoubt soils have albic horizons and occur on similar landscapes. Qutal soils are somewhat poorly drained are on depressions. Spenard soils are very poorly drained and occur on depressions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very low to high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is high is the solum and moderately high to high is the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for vegetables, hay production, rangeland, residential development, recreation, and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is bluejoint grass, fireweed, alder, and associated plants. Clumps of Lutz spruce and alder is common

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska, The series is of moderate extent.
