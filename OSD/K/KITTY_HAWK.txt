COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape--Barrier island lagoons
Landform--Washover-fan flats and slopes
Parent material--Sandy lagoonal deposits with origin from marine and eolian sands
Slope--0 to 1 percent 
Water depth range--0 to 3 meters (0 to 10 feet) below mean sea level
Water salinity range--0.5 to 5 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Pine Island and Trinity Harbor soils.
Pine Island soils--are on relict flood-tidal deltas and shoals and do not contain hypersulfidic materials.
Trinity Harbor soils--are on high-energy lagoon bottoms and do not contain hypersulfidic materials.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately high to high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by brackish water. The water level is primarily driven by wind tides.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--The area is used for recreational fishing, swimming, hunting, and boating. Uses also include commercial fishing and crabbing.
Typical vegetation--Vegetation includes widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata), wild celery (Vallisneria americana), southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis), stonewort (Nitella sp.), and invasive Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). Vegetation coverage typically ranges from 25 to 50 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Coastal plain estuaries in North Carolina and Virgina
Land Resource Regions--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s)--153B
Extent--Small  

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Region

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Dare County, North Carolina, 2026

REMARKS:
The series is named after the town of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Kitty Hawk soils were previously mapped as water in North Carolina and Virginia soil surveys.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022):
Ochric epipedon--The zone from 0 to 55 centimeters.
Hyposulfidic materials--The zone from 0 to 55 centimeters and 93 to 200 centimeters has an initial pH that decreases by 1 or more units but remains at a value of 4.0 or more after 16 weeks of moist aerobic incubation.
Hypersulfidic materials--The zone from 55 to 93 centimeters has a pH of 4.0 or less after 16 weeks of moist aerobic incubation.
Peraquic feature--Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface (permanently submerged).
