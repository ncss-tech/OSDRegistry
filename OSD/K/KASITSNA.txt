TYPE LOCATION: Lower Kenai Peninsula Area, Alaska; about 5 miles southeast of Nanwalek, 1600 feet north and 200 feet west of the SE corner of section 19, T. 10S., R. 15W., Seward Meridian; USGS Seldovia B-5 quadrangle; lat. 59 degrees 17 minutes 30 seconds N. and long. 151 degrees 51 minutes 30 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no completing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: silty mantle of volcanic ash over basal glacial till, reworked glacial till, and colluvial deposits
Landform: glacial moraines and mountainslopes
Slopes: 3 to 120 percent
Elevation: 20 to 1500 feet.
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 39 degrees F.
Mean January temperature: is about 23 degrees F.
Mean July temperature: is about
Mean annual snowfall: 70 to 140 inches
Mean annual precipitation: 65 to 75 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Chenega, Jakolof, Koyuktolik, Seldovia, and Tutka soils. Chenega soils do not have spodic horizons, are sandy-skeletal, and are on floodplains. Jakolof soils are on stream terraces. Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic matter accumulated in depressions. Seldovia soils occur on similar landscapes or in complex with Kasitsna soils. Tutka soils have bedrock within 20 inches and are on glacially abraded bedrock ridges.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the ash mantle and moderately high to high in the glacial till.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, subsistence, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Kasitsna soils have native vegetation of Sitka spruce, devils club, alder, salmonberry, fern, and bluejoint grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 223 Cook Inlet Mountains, Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
