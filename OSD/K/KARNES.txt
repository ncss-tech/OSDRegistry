KARNES SERIES

The Karnes series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from limestone. These soils occur on nearly level to moderately sloping footslopes on hillslopes or stream terraces on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about degrees 18.3 C (degrees 65 F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Typic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Karnes loam--rangeland.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Similar soils are the Kerrville, Rio Frio, and Stilskin series.
Kerrville soils: are moderately deep to bedrock and are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section.
Rio Frio soils: are fine-loamy with greater than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.
Stilskin soils: are shallow to bedrock and loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material: loamy slope alluvium derived from limestone
Landscape: dissected plateaus
Landform: dominantly on footslopes on hillslopes; stream terraces
Slope: 0 to 8 percent, but dominantly less than 3 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 610 to 737 mm (24 to 29 in)
Thornthwaite P.E. index: 30 to 44
Mean annual air temperature: 17.8 to 19.4 degrees C (64 to 67 degrees F)
Frost-free period: 210 to 240 days
Elevation: 518.2 to 609.6 m (1700 to 2000 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brackett, Dev, Frio, Hext, Nuvalde, and Tarrant series.
Brackett soils: have bedrock within 51 cm (20 in) and occur on higher positions.
Dev soils: contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section and occur on lower flood plains.
Frio soils: have a mollic epipedon, smectitic mineralogy, and occur on lower flood plains.
Hext soils: have mixed mineralogy and occur on higher positions.
Nuvalde soils: have a mollic epipedon and mixed mineralogy.
Tarrant soils: contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, have bedrock within 51cm (20 in) and occur on higher positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and low on 5 to 8 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for cropland and range.  Cultivated crops are cotton, flax, small grain, and grain sorghum.  Range consists of little bluestem, sideoats grama, indiangrass, and scattered live oak trees.  Heavily used pastures are dominantly of shorter grasses, such as curly mesquite and buffalograss.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Texas; LRR I - Southwest Plateaus and Plains Range and Cotton Region; Edwards Plateau, Central Part (MLRA 81B) and Edwards Plateau, Eastern Part (MLRA 81C).  Karnes soils are moderately extensive.
