KIMERA SERIES

The Kimera series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian deposits derived from sedimentary rock.  Kimera soils are on plains, interfluves, ridges, fans, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 millimeters (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 t to 200 centimeters (0 to 79 inches).
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches).  (part of the Bw, Bk1, and part of the Bk2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches).  (A horizons)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 38 centimeters (4 to 15 inches).  (Bw horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 38 to 145 centimeters (15 to 57 inches).  (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)
Other features:  ustic aridic moisture regime

This soil was previously identified as part of the Kim series.  This series was established as a result of documentation demonstrating the presence of a calcic horizon (with visible segregated lime).

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is identified in lab data pedon #S03CO071004.
