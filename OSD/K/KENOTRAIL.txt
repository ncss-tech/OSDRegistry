KENOTRAIL SERIES

The Kenotrail series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived primarily from serpentine, greenstone, and talc with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on ridges and shoulders of mountains.  Slope ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, magnesic, frigid Vitrandic Haploxeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kenotrail silt loam on a 39 percent southeast facing slope at an elevation of 1100 meters, under a mixed Douglas-fir-ponderosa pine canopy.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oe--0 to 5 cm; needles, cones, bark, twigs, and partially decomposed organic matter.

    A--5 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 cm thick)

    BA--15 to 28 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silt loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many very fine and fine roots, few common roots; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt1--28 to 53 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) gravelly silty clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few thin clay films on ped faces and in pores; common very fine and fine roots, few medium roots; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bt2--53 to 86 cm; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) gravelly silty clay loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few thin clay films on ped faces and in pores; common fine and few very fine roots; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent weathered gravel -size talc fragments; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bt horizons - 30 to 90 cm).

    Cr--86 cm; partially decomposed talc.

TYPE LOCATION:  Colville Indian Reservation; Ferry County, Washington; about 21 km northeast of the town of Keller; about 90 meters east and 290 meters north of the southwest corner of sec. 25, T. 32 N., R. 33 E., W.M.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm--7 to 8 degrees C
These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 10 and 30 cm for 60 to 75 consecutive days.
Bulk density--1.35 to 1.50 g/cc in the upper 18 to 36 cm
Volcanic glass content--5 to 20 percent
Extractable aluminum content--0.4 to 1.0 percent
15-bar water retention--5 to 10 percent for air dried samples   
Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact with weathered talc--50 to 100 cm

Particle-size control section:
Clay content--18 to 35 percent clay
Rock fragment content--15 to 35 percent gravel, averaging about 18 percent
Reaction--pH 6.1 to 7.3

A horizon
Hue--7.5YR or 10YR
Value--5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma--3 through 5 moist or dry
Rock fragment content--5 to 15 percent gravel

Bt horizon
Hue--7.5YR or 5YR
Value--6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma--4 through 6 moist or dry
Texture--silty clay loam or clay loam
Rock fragment content--15 to 35 percent, with 15 to 30 percent weathered gravel-size talc fragments 
There are few thin to moderately thick clay films on ped faces and lining pores.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Nahahum, Nardmont and Panak series.  Nahahum, Nardmont and Panak soils are more than 100 cm deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform--ridges and shoulders of mountains
Elevation--975 to 1150 meters
Slope--20 to 40 percent
Parent material--residuum derived primarily from serpentine, greenstone, talc and other metaigneous rock with a surface admixture of volcanic ash and loess
Mean annual precipitation--460 to 560 mm
Mean annual air temperature--6 degrees C
Mean January temperature--minus 5 degrees C
Mean July temperature--18 degrees C
Frost-free period--90 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium to rapid runoff; permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately slow in the lower part of the solum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation are the principal uses.  The native vegetation is Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and western larch with an understory of pinegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, sweetscented bedstraw, spreading sweetroot, Hook violet, common snowberry, Saskatoon serviceberry, heartleaf arnica, silky lupine, dwarf rose and kinnikinnick.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kenotrail soils are of small extent in northcentral Washington; MLRA 43A.
