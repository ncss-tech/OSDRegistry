KAHOLA SERIES

The Kahola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium.  Kahola soils are on flood plains on river valleys in the Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters (33 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kahola silt loam in a cultivated field at an elevation of 404 meters (1324 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly plastic and slightly sticky; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

  A--23 to 61 centimeters (9 to 24 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable slightly plastic and slightly sticky; common worm holes and casts; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (14 to 30 inches thick)

  AC--61 to 89 centimeters (24 to 35 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable slightly plastic and slightly sticky; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

  C--89 to 200 centimeters (35 to 80 inches); dark brown (10YR 3/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; massive; hard, friable, slightly plastic and slightly sticky; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Chase County, Kansas; about 1/2 mile southeast of Wonsevu, Kansas; 660 feet west and 1,450 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 9, T. 22 S., R. 6 E.; Wonsevu USGS quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 8 minutes 53.0 seconds N. and longitude 96 degrees 46 minutes 13.0 seconds W., WGS84.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Allison, Anthon, Huntsville, Ivan, Judson, Kennebec, Kenridge, Lindstrom, Napier, Rossville, Sturkie, and Worthen series.  
Allison, Anthon, Huntsville, Judson, Kennebec, Kenridge, Lindstrom, Rossville, Sturkie, and Worthon soils have carbonates at depths greater than 100 centimeters (40 inches).  
Napier soils have carbonates at depths greater than 91 centimeters (36 inches).  
Ivan soils have free carbonates within a depth of 25 centimeters (10 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: silty alluvium
Landform: flood plains on river valleys
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 305 to 450 meters (1000 to 1475 feet)
Mean annual air temperature: 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 810 to 910 millimeters (32 to 36 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 170 to 190 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chase, Reading, Ivan, Clime, and Irwin soils.  Chase and Reading soils are on higher stream terrace positions and have an argillic horizon.  Ivan soils are on similar landform positions but have carbonates within 25 centimeters (10 inches).  Clime and Irwin soils are on adjacent uplands and have a fine particle size class.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained  
Runoff: low 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high  
Flooding: occasional brief or very brief flooding

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Kahola are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, grain sorghum, wheat, and alfalfa are the principal crops.  Native vegetation is tall grass prairie with scattered hardwood trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Kansas; Land Resource Region H; Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; MLRA 76, Bluestem Hills. The series is of moderate extent 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Riley County, Kansas, 1970.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 89 centimeters (0 to 35 inches) (Ap, A, and AC horizons)
Udic moisture regime.
Flood plains exist on meander belts only in channeled map units.

07/2003 WAW Changed to semi-tabular format, update cation exchange activity class. To superactive.

09/2015 DJK Updated intro to current standards. Added in metric units. Added clay content, sand content, fragments, and CCE to RIC. Updated competing series. Changed geographic setting to tabular and added in elevation, precipitation pattern, and FFD. Updated geographically associated soils by adding Reading and Ivan and deleting Eudora and Florence. Changed permeability to Ksat. Added crops to use and vegetation. Added LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent. Added lab data to additional data. 

Additional data: Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory data is available for Pedon IDs 91KS061001ksu, 97KS161003, and 97KS061034.
