KENMOOR SERIES

The Kenmoor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy alluvium over clayey alluvium on flood plains and flood-plain steps of major streams. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 940 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy over clayey, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Kenmoor loamy fine sand - on a level flood plain under cultivation. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Ap--0 to 15 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 centimeters thick)

	C--15 to 71 centimeters; stratified grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand and fine sand; single grain; loose; common fine roots; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (25 to 86 centimeters thick)

	2Ab--71 to 94 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay; moderate fine and very fine angular and subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 30 centimeters thick)

	2Bgb--94 to 170 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay; moderate medium angular blocky structure; firm; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron throughout; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. 
Soils that are similar are the Modale, Moville, Sarpy and Waubonsie series. 
Modale and Moville soils are coarse-silty over clayey. 
Sarpy soils are sandy and do not have contrasting textures. 
Waubonsie soils are coarse-loamy over clayey.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent materials--sandy alluvium over clayey alluvium
Landscape--river valleys
Landforms--flood plains and flood-plain steps of major streams 
Slope--0 to 3 percent 
Elevation-122 to 274 meters above sea level 
Mean annual temperature--8 to 14 degrees C. 
Mean annual precipitation--660 to 1016 millimeters 
Frost-free period--155 to 230 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Haynie, Leta, Modale, Sarpy, Waldron, and Waubonsie soils. 
Haynie soils have more silt and clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section and are at higher elevations and occupy positions further back from the stream.
Leta and Waldron soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section and are at lower elevations and occupy positions farther back from the stream. 
Modale and Waubonsie soils more silt and clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section and are at similar elevations and occupy similar positions. 
Sarpy soils are sandy throughout and occupy positions close to the stream.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage--Moderately well drained. In undisturbed areas, water saturation is at 61 to 96 centimeters during November to June in years with normal amounts of precipitation.
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat)--10 to 141 micrometers per second (high or very high) in the sandy alluvium and 0.42 to 1.4 micrometers per second (moderately low or moderately high) in the underlying clayey alluvium 
Flooding--rare or occasional for brief to long periods 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cleared and utilized the same way as adjoining soils. These soils are used to grow corn, wheat, and soybeans, or are used for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is mostly willow, cottonwood and oak trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Land Resource Region: M - Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region
Major Land Resource Areas:
--107B - Iowa and Missouri Deep Loess Hills
--115B - Central Mississippi Valley Wooded Slopes, Western Part

The Kenmoor soils are of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harrison County, Iowa, 1971.

REMARKS: Kenmoor soils do not seem to have a wetness problem during much of the growing season. In fact, droughtiness is a problem even though the finer-textured material underneath is wet for periods of time.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are: 
Ochric epipedon- the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 centimeters (Ap horizon) 
Contrasting particle size--71 centimeters (2Ab horizon) 

Taxonomic Subgroup changed from Aquic to Oxyaquic in March 2009.
