KUY SERIES

The Kuy series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, active, hyperthermic Grossarenic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kuy sand-- on a northwest-facing, convex, 0.6 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 34 m (110 ft). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); brown (10YR 4/3) sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; single grain; loose; common fine and few medium roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

   E1--18 to 69 cm (7 to 27 in); light gray (10YR 7/2) sand, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry; single grain; loose; few fine and medium roots; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

   E2--69 to 132 cm (27 to 52 in); light gray (10YR 7/2) sand, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry; single grain; loose; few fine and medium roots; common faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) lamella in lower 30 cm (12 in); slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of A and E horizons is 101 to 191 cm [40 to 75 in])

   Bt1--132 to 150 cm  (52 to 59 in); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy loam, yellow (10YR 7/6) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; few fine roots; few fine pores; few patchy clay films; a laminar cap occurs in the upper 5 cm (2 in) of this horizon and is comprised of about 10 to 15 percent by volume of skeletans of light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sand and silt; many coarse prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron with sharp boundaries in matrix surrounding iron concentrations, few fine prominent red (2.5YR 4/8) masses of oxidized iron with sharp boundaries in matrix; slightly acid.  (Thickness of the Bt horizon is 0 to 38 cm [0 to 15 in])

  Bt2--150 to 203 cm (59 to 80 in); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; moderate very fine angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm; few fine roots; common pressure faces; many medium and coarse prominent red (2.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron with sharp boundaries in matrix; moderately acid.
