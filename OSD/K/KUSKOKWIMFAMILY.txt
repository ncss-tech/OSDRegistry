TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive Aquic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kuskokwimfamily silt loam - on a slope of 1 percent on a terrace under tundra vegetation at 187 feet elevation. (All colors are for moist soil unless noted)

      Oi--0 to 2 inches, (0 to 6 cm); very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) slightly decomposed organic matter; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; moderately acid, pH 6.0; abrupt smooth boundary.

      A--2 to 6 inches, (6 to 14 cm); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silt loam; weak fine granular structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few coarse roots; strongly acid, pH 5.5; clear smooth boundary.

      Bw--6 to 24 inches, (14 to 60 cm); olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; firm, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots, and few medium and coarse roots; 10 percent fine grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) gley; slightly acid, pH 6.5; gradual smooth boundary.

      C1--24 to 69 inches, (60 to 175 cm); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak medium platy structure; firm, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; 20 percent fine gray (10YR 5/1) gley and 25 percent fine strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; slightly acid, pH 6.5; clear smooth boundary.

      C2--69 to 79 inches, (175 to 200 cm); brown (10YR 4/3) stratified very fine sandy loam to silt loam; weak medium platy structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; 20 percent fine gray (10YR 5/1) gley and 25 percent fine strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) redox concentrations; slightly acid, pH 6.5.

COMPETING SERIES: These are no series in this family.  When a series is established, this series placeholder will be dropped (see REMARKS).
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess and alluvium
Landform: toeslopes and footslopes of hills, terraces, and floodplains 
Slope: 0 to 12 percent
Mean annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 18 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Typic Histoturbels and Typic Cryofluvents on similar landforms. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Low to medium runoff. Permeability is moderate.
 
USE AND VEGETATION: Used for subsistence and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is typical of Boreal scrub, woodland, and forestland.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229 - Interior Alaska Lowlands; MLRA 230 - Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands; and MLRA 238- Yukon-Kuskokwim Coastal Plain, Alaska. The soil is extensive.

SERIES PROPOSED: The Western Interior Rivers Area, Alaska, 2007

REMARKS: This series is set-up as a placeholder to allow the use of a short family name.  The range in characteristics is broader than a typical series and may even encompass the full range of the family.  There are currently no series designated in this soil family.

Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include:
Mineral horizons: from 2 to 79 inches.
Temperature regime: Cryic
Moisture regime: Udic
Cambic horizon: 6 to 24 inches
Redox features: 24 to 79 inches
