KEMUK SERIES

The Kemuk series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in organic material over loess on talfs of plains. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 650 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degree C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, acid, subgelic Histic Gelaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kemuk mucky peat, located on a plain talf with a slope of 2 percent and elevation of 52 meters; when described on August 2nd, 2006 the soil was saturated throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oe--0 to 27 cm; mucky peat; many very fine and fine roots, common medium roots, and few coarse roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); gradual smooth boundary

 Ag--27 to 40 cm; 50 percent very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and 50 percent very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam; 24 percent sand; 66 percent silt; 10 percent clay; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; strongly acid (pH 5.1); gradual wavy boundary

 Cg--40 to 183 cm; 65 percent gray (5Y 5/1) silt loam; 25 percent sand; 67 percent silt; 8 percent clay; massive; friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; 35 percent coarse dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist, masses of reduced iron with diffuse boundaries; strongly acid (pH 5.4)

TYPE LOCATION: Dillingham Census Area, Alaska; 2 kilometers west of the Village of Ekwok; 59.3505556 degrees north latitude and 157.5188889 degrees west longitude.
