KEVILAR SERIES

The Kevilar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a mantle of loamy alluvium over sandy alluvium underlain by stratified loamy and sandy alluvium on valley trains.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle, rapid in the sandy middle part, and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying stratified alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F..

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Mollic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Kevilar sandy loam - on a convex, southwest facing 4 percent slope in cropland at an elevation of 815 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 9 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 9 inches thick)

   Bt1--9 to 23 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

   Bt2--23 to 29 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine and fine roots; common faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 15 to 32 inches)

   2BC1--29 to 43 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sand; single grain; loose; few very fine and fine roots; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.

   2BC2--43 to 50 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; single grain; loose; common prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the 2BC horizon ranges from 5 to 25 inches)

   3Bt--50 to 80 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy loam with thin strata of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; breaks to weak thick plates along depositional strata; common faint brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds and in pores; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation and few coarse prominent brown (7.5YR 5/2) masses of iron depletion; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: Pepin County, Wisconsin; about 4 miles east of Durand; 2250 feet south and 100 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 31, T.  25 N., R. 12 W.; Latitude: 44 degrees 36 minutes  17 seconds N; Longitude: 91 degrees 52 minutes  25 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy alluvium ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the underlying stratified loamy and sandy alluvium ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Redox accumulations and saturation occur within a depth of 72 inches.  Saturation does not occur within a depth of 40 inches for more than 1 month or more per year, in 6 or more out of 10 years.

The Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon, 5 to 8 inches thick with color and texture similar to the Ap.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in Ap horizons where the soil is limed.

Some pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.

The 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.

The 3Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is stratified.  Individual strata are mostly sandy loam or loam with thin (<1") strata of finer or coarser texture.  Sand content averages less than 70 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

Some pedons have a 4C horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is stratified.  Indiviual strata are mostly sand or loamy sand with thin strata of finer texture.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Backbone, Billett, Desker, Forkhorn, Kingsley, Oronoco, Pardeeville, Renwick(T), Rusktown, and Ulster series.   None of these soils except the moderately well drained phase of the Billett series and the Oronoco and Rusktown series have redox features or saturation in the series control section.  Billett soils average 70 to 90 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Oronoco soils have redox features but no saturation in the series control section and do not have sandy texture in the series control section.  Rusktown soils average 90 percent or more total sand in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kevilar soils are on valley trains.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 750 to 850 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Near the type location this is the Prissel(T) series.  The moderately well drained Prissel soils are in positions similar to those of Kevilar soils where the 20 to 40 inch loamy mantle is absent.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle, rapid in the sandy middle part, and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying stratified alluvium.  Kevilar soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 3.5 to 6.0 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period of October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Kevilar soils have been cleared and are used for cropland.  Corn, soybeans, smalll grains, and hay are the principal crops.  A few areas remain in woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and pine forest.  Northern pin oak, northern red oak, black oak, white oak and eastern white pine

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Wisconsin.  This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pepin County, Wisconsin, 1998.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Prior to 1996, Kevilar soils were most often mapped in the Billett series as a moderately well drained phase.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon (darker than typic) - 0 to 9 inches (Ap); argillic horizon - 9 to 29 inches (Bt1, Bt2) and 50 to 80 inches (3Bt);
