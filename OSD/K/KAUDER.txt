KAUDER SERIES 

The Kauder series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well-drained soils that formed in loess and reworked loess with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Kauder soils are on hills on plateaus, benches and broad ridges with slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  They have moderately low or low saturated hydraulic conductivity.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kauder soils are on hills on plateaus, benches and broad ridges at elevations of 1,600 to 4,100 feet (488 to 1250 meters).  The slope range is 3 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 50 inches (660 to 1270 mm) and the frost-free season is 50 to 120 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carlinton, Dworshak , Grangemont , and Reggear  series. Carlinton soils are on basalt plateaus and have xeric moisture regimes. Dworshak soils are on mountain slopes and do not have a fragipan. Grangemont soils are on similar landforms and do not have a fragipan. Reggear soils are on similar landforms and have a mixed volcanic ash mantle. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or low; A perched water table occurs at a depth of 20 to 32 inches (50 to 81 cm) from January through May but can occur at a depth of 18 to 40 inches (46 to 102 cm) from November through July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used primarily for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed.  Some areas have been cleared for cultivation.  The natural vegetation is mainly western red-cedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, Myrtle pachystima, common snowberry, queencup beadlily, and longtube twinflower. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-Central, Idaho; Kauder soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.
