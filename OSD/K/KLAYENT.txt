KLAYENT SERIES

The Klayent series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium. These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fergus County, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 36 cm (Ap and Bw horizons) 
Secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - from 36 to 58 cm (Bkyz horizon) 
Gypsum accumulation - from 36 to 170 cm (Bkyz, Byzg, Cyzg1, and Cyzg2 horizons)
Pedogenic salt accumulation - from 36 to 170 cm (Bkyz, Byzg, Cyzg1, and Cyzg2 horizons)
Redox concentrations - from 36 to 170 cm (Bkyz, Byzg, Cyzg1, and Cyzg2 horizons)
Strong gleying - from 58 to 170 cm (Byzg, Cyzg1, and Cyzg2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the Bw, Bkyz, Byzg, Cyzg1 horizons)  

Klayent soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.

Gypsum accumulation in the C horizons was not recorded at the type location in 1976. This OSD needs to be investigated across the extent of the series.
