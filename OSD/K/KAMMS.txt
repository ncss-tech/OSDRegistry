KAMMS SERIES

The Kamms series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium. The Kamms soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 309 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.

Mean annual air temperature - 6 to 8 degrees C
Frost-free period - 110 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Kamms soils are generally used as native rangeland; however, they may be cultivated and irrigated to produce alfalfa hay, barley, sugar beets, corn, silage, or beans. Principal native plants are bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, thickspike wheatgrass and Wyoming big sagebrush. As this site deteriorates blue grama, threadleaf sedge, threeawn and prickly pear cactus become the dominant vegetation. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kamms soils are of small extent in northwestern Wyoming. MLRA 32.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED: Park County Area, Wyoming, Eastern Part, 2014. The original series concept (Asherton) was developed in 1977. The named is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 10 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Calcic horizon - from 10 to 152 cm (Bk1, Bk2, BCk1, and BCk2 horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the Bk2, BCk1, and BCk2 horizons)

Kamms soils have a mesic temperature regime and an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.
