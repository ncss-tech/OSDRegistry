KINOCKITY SERIES

The Kinockity series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granite.  Kinockity soils are on pediments, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, thermic, shallow Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kinockity extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand - recreation and wildlife habitat.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine, fine and medium irregular pores; 50 percent gravel, 20 percent cobble; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 9 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine, medium and coarse roots; few very fine irregular and few very fine and medium tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C2--9 to 16 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loamy sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; few very fine and medium irregular pores; 45 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 9 to 18 inches)

    Cr--16 inches; granitic grus.

TYPE LOCATION:  Coronado National Memorial; located at a latitude of 31 degrees, 21 minutes, 16 seconds North and longitude of 110 degrees, 15 minutes, 8 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  59 to 64 degrees F.

Rock fragments:  averages 35 to 60 percent but can have less than 35 percent in any one horizon

Clay content:  averages less than 8 percent

Depth to weathered bedrock:  14 to 20 inches

Depth to unweathered bedrock:  26 to 40 inches

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist
Texture:  coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand

C horizons
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist
Texture:  coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kinockity soils are on pediments, hill and mountain side slopes at elevations of 5100 to as much as 7200 feet on warm southerly exposures.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granite.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Budlamp soil.  Budlamp soils have a mollic epipedon and have unweathered bedrock within 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow to rapid runoff; very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for recreation and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes sideoats grama, sotol, bullgrass, plains lovegrass, Arizona white oak, Emory oak, pinyon pine and alligator juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Arizona.  Kinockity soils are of limited extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 41.
