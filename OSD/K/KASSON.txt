KASSON SERIES

The Kasson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying till.  These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--moderately well drained--a frequently saturated zone occurs at a depth of 0.6 meter during in the wettest periods of normal years and both perched and apparent saturation can occur on this soil based on the season and intensity of rainfall during a given period of time

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fillmore County, Minnesota, 1955.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 28 to 78 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, BE, Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2BC1 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 28 to 135 centimeters (Bt1,2Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 30 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Oxyaquic subgroup based on a zone of saturation within 100 centimeters for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years.
