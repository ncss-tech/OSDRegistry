GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bernardpeak, Cirquecreek, Fourthofjuly, Greylingcreek, Ride,and Swampylakes soils. 
Bernardpeak soils are somewhat poorly drained, are organic soils, and occur on stream terraces in mountain valleys.
Cirquecreek soils are well drained, do not have a mollic epipedon, and occur on saddles and mountain slopes
Fourthofjuly soils are well drained, have folistic epipedons, and occur on mountain valleys and stream terraces.
Greylingcreek soils are excessively drained, do not have a mollic epipedon, and occur in mountain valleys and moraines.
Ride soils are somewhat excessively drained, with very gravelly sandy loam surface textures, and occur on mountain slopes and hillslopes.
Swampylakes soils are somewhat poorly drained, a mollic epipedon, aquic conditions starting between 34 and 40 cm (13 and 16in), on mountain slopes and hillslopes.
