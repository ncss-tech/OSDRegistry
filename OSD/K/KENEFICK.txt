DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Kenefick soils are well drained.  Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and low on 3 to 5 percent slopes. An apparent water table exists in the BtC horizon in during the winter and spring months.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for woodland and improved pasture.  A few areas are cropped to soybeans.  Native vegetation is mixed pine and hardwoods of loblolly and shortleaf pine, sweetgum, and various oak species.  Mulberry, white bay, American holly, and sassafras are also common.  The understory vegetation consists of yaupon, greenbriar, American beautyberry and various perennial grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B) of southeast Texas and Louisiana; LRR T; moderate extent

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Liberty County, Texas; l986.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped as a variant of the Attoyac series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in) (A, E, and EB horizons).

Argillic horizon: 46 to 165 cm (18 to 65 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Ultic feature: Base saturation is less than 60 percent at a depth of 125 cm (50 in) below the top of the argillic horizon.

Additional Comments: The series was updated during the Soil Data Join Recorrelation initiative.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Lab on samples (S00TX-457-001) from Tyler County, TX. This pedon would classify in the ultisols order according to base saturation data.
