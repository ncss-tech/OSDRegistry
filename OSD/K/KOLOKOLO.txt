KOLOKOLO SERIES

The Kolokolo series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from basic igneous rock. Kolokolo soils are on stream bottoms and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual rainfall is about 2670 mm (105 in) and mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, isohyperthermic Fluvaquentic Humudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kolokolo clay loam - pasture. (All textures are "apparent field textures.")

 A -- 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19 in); dark brown (10YR 3/3) dry, very dark brown (10YR 2/3) moist, clay loam, moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; slight effervescence with hydrogen peroxide; 5 percent subrounded basalt gravels, 4 percent subrounded basalt cobbles, and 2 percent subrounded basalt stones; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt irregular boundary. (40 to 58 cm [16 to 23 in] thick)

 C1 -- 48 to 71 cm (19 to 28 in); brown (7.5YR 4/4) dry, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist, loam, massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many medium, fine and very fine pores; slight effervescence with hydrogen peroxide; material looks sandy until rubbed; many worm casts of dark A material; 5 percent subrounded basalt gravels, 4 percent subrounded basalt cobbles, and 2 percent subrounded basalt stones; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 28 cm [6 to 11 in] thick)

 C2 -- 71 to 117 cm (28 to 46 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic, few fine and very fine roots; many medium, fine and very fine pores; slight effervescence with hydrogen peroxide; 6 percent subrounded basalt gravels, 2 percent subrounded basalt cobbles, and 2 percent subrounded basalt stones; neutral (pH 7.1); gradual smooth boundary. (41 to 51 cm [16 to 20 in] thick)

 C3 -- 117 to 152 cm (46 to 60 in); brown (10YR 4/3) dry and moist; silty clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; slight effervescence with hydrogen peroxide; material looks sandy until rubbed; common black stains; 6 percent subrounded basalt gravels, 2 percent basalt cobbles, and 2 percent subrounded basalt stones; neutral (pH 7.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family at this time. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kolokolo soils are on valleys along small and large streams on the east and north sides of the island of Kauai. They formed in alluvium from basic igneous rock sources in high rainfall areas.

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.
Elevation: 15 to 250 m (50 to 820 ft)
Mean annual precipitation is 1,520 to 3,810 mm (60 to 150 in)
Mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) 
Average January temperature is about 20 degrees C (69 degrees F)
Average July temperature is about 24 degrees C (76 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hanalei, Hanamaulu, Hihimanu and Kalapa soils. Kolokolo soils are on flood plain steps and are stratified, Hanamaulu soils are on stream terraces and have oxic horizons. Hihimanu soils are on steep mountain slopes and have weathered bedrock at 100 to greater than 150cm. Kalapa soils are on footslopes of mountain slopes and have argillic horizons. Hanalei soils are on flood plain steps and mottled. Hanamaulu, Hihimanu, and Kalapa soils have B horizons as red as 5YR or redder. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability. Occasional flooding from January to April, and rare flooding from May to December for very brief duration. Rare ponding throughout the year for very brief duration.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for pasture, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Principle vegetation is pangolagrass (Digitaria decumbens), kikuyugrass (Pennisetum clandestinum), guava (Psidium guajava), pandanus (Pandanus odoratissimus), glenwoodgrass (Sacciolepis contarta), ricegrass (Paspalum orbiculare), hau (Hibiscus tiliaceus), mango (Mangifera indica). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Humid Oxidic Soils on Low and Intermediate Rolling Mountain Slopes; MLRA 167.  Stream valleys on east and north sides of the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The soils are of limited extent.
