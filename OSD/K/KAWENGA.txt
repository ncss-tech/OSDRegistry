KAWENGA SERIES

The Kawenga series consists of deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone. Kawenga soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alumrock, Arujo, Botella, Chico, Elkhorn, Havala, Lockwood, McCoy, Minlum, Rimtrail, Saltcanyon, Sapwi and Tongva soils. Arujo soils have 33 degrees F.difference between mean summer soil temperatures and mean winter soil temperatures and do not have more than 10 percent coarse fragments. Bottella, Chico,  Elkhorn, Havala, Lockwood, Minlum, Rimtrail and Saltcanyon soils do not have paralithic bedrock within 60 inches. Alumrock, McCoy and Tongva soils have a paralithic bedrock at 25 to 40 inches. Sapwi soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kawenga soils are on northerly and easterly facing, concave, side slopes of hills and mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 500 to 3000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 24 inches, the mean annual temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F., and the frost free season is to 290 to 330 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mipolomol (T), Sapwi (T), Topanga (T), and Zumaridge (T) soils. All these soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains. Mipolomol and Topanga soils are shallow to rock. Sapwi soils are moderately deep to an R horizon and lack BC horizons. Zumaridge soils lack argillic horizons and are shallow to rock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to very high runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat, recreation and building site development. Vegetation is Greenbark chaparral, Big Pod chaparral, Chamise chaparral, Bush Monkey Flower, and miscellaneous forbs and grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ventura County, Los Angeles County and Santa Clara County, California. The soil is not extensive. MLRA 20 and MLRA 15.
