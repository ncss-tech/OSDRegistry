KINMAN SERIES

The Kinman series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone, mudstone, and siltstone. Kinman soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1400 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: Dupee, Linslaw, Santiam, and the Zing series.  The Dupee, Linslaw, and Santiam soils have ochric epipedons. Zing soils formed in colluvium derived from igneous rocks. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kinman soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Kinman soils are on concave to slightly convex slopes. Elevations range from 600 to 1100 meters. These soils formed in slow-moving earthflows. Landscapes dominated by Kinman soils have hummocky relief, slips, and intermittent springs. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1300 to 1650 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 6 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 17 degrees C., and the mean annual temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C. Frost free period is about 200 to 280 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Elkcamp and Airstrip soils. Airstrip soils are on convex positons, contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments, and have lithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters. Elkcamp soils contain less than 35 percent clay and are on hummocky slopes.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; very high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for livestock grazing, watershed, and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is annual and perennial grass and forbs including soft brome, bristly dogstail grass, wildrye, medusahead, and western rush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area; MLRA 4B. The soils are not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Humboldt County Soil Survey, Central Part, California, 2014. The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 33 centimeters (A1, A2 horizons) 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 33 to 95 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2 horizons) 
Particle size control section - the zone from 33 to 83 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Aquultic subgroup - the zone from 33 to 180 cm (Bt1, Bt2, C1, C2, C3 horizons)
The type location was moved in 2014 from UTM Zone 10 399562mE, 4478145mN to locate the series in an area with somewhat poorly drained soils.
Kinman was proposed in the 1959 State Cooperative Soil-Vegetation Survey.  The soil was formerly classified in the Prairie group. Lab data from three soils(Peaked 07N0346, Forhaux 07N0347, and Pigtoe 07N0348) near the original type location all have BS below 50% (NH4OAc) at the surface, superactive CEC activity classes, and less than 75% BS (sum of cations) in some horizon above 75 cm. However, pH of most soils indicates higher B.S. and parent material in area is weathered from gouge material of chloritic schist. The original Kinman was moderately well to somewhat poorly drained. Minerology was changed from vermiculitic to mixed because of a preponderance of local lab data.  The soil temperature regime was changed from isomesic to mesic because of a preponderance of soil temperature data.
