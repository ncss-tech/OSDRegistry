REMARKS: 
These soils were formerly classified as Coarse-silty, carbonatic, isohyperthermic Thapto-Histic Fluvaquents and are revised here to the twelfth edition of the keys (2014).
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this typical pedon:

1.	Limnic soil material 0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches) (Lma horizon) and 38 to 165 centimeters (15 to 65 inches) (Lma/Oa, L'ma horizons)
2.	Sulfidic soil materials - the zone from 0 to 165 centimeters (65 inches).
3.	Thapto-Histic feature - 23 to 38 centimeters (9 to 15 inches, Oase horizon) and 38 to 69 centimeters (15 to 27 inches, stratified Lma/Oase horizon).
4.	Lithic contact (very deep) 165 centimeters (65 inches) (2R horizon)
5.	Calcium carbonate equivalence of greater than 80 percent in the coastal marl deposits
6.	Peraquic feature - the zone from 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches).
7.	Aquic conditions - endosaturation ranges from 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches).
