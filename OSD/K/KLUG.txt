KLUG SERIES  

The Klug series consists of very deep, well drained, soils on foothills and mountains.  They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from quartzite, slate and granite.  Permeability is moderate or  moderately rapid.  Slopes are  5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual  precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature  is about 37 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryolls  

TYPICAL PEDON:  Klug gravelly loam - on an east-facing mountain slope of  43 percent in rangeland at 7,100 feet elevation.  (When described on  June 22, 1983, the soil was air-dry throughout.  Colors are for air-dry  soil unless otherwise stated.)  

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very  dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular  structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very  fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular  pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  

    AB--4 to 9 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly loam, very  dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure  parting to weak very fine and fine granular; soft, very friable,  nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium  roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; 40 percent  gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.

    C2--37 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely  gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard,  very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and  fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel and 30  percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Antrobus, Basinpeak (T), Broad Canyon,  Decram, Fairydell, Farlow, Foxmount, Gaia (T), Grafen, Greyback,  Handran, Kamack, Krackle, Lag, Maurice, McCort (T), Middlehill,  Midelight, Midfork, Parachute, Rockabin, Silvercliff, Sup,  Supervisor, Teemat (T), Thornburgh, Tiban, Timmercrek (T), Tinaman, and  Wareagle series.  Antrobus soils are calcareous throughout and have 20  to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Basinpeak and  Handran soils lack a cambic horizon.  Broad Canyon soils have very stony  or very gravelly loamy sand at 24 to 40 inches and are slightly or  moderately acid.  Decram, Foxmount, Grafen, Krackle, Middlehill,  Parachute, Rockabin, and Supervisor soils are moderately deep.  Fairydell and Silvercliff soils have a calcic horizon.  Farlow soils  have calcium carbonate at 6 to 20 inches.  Gaia soils have lamellae and  lack a cambic horizon.  Greyback and Teemat soils have calcium carbonate  at 7 to 15 inches.  Kamack soils have an O horizon and receive 25 to 30  inches of precipitation.  Lag soils have summer soil temperature of 45  to 47 degrees F., have an O horizon and support a forest plant  community.  Maurice soils have average annual soil temperature of 43 to  47 degrees F.  McCort soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bw horizon.  Midelight soils are deep and have a Bk horizon that is moderately or  strongly alkaline.  Midfork soils lack a Bw horizon and have calcium  carbonate at 4 to 15 inches.  Sebud soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in  the particle-size control section.  Sup soils are moderately acid or  slightly acid throughout.  Thornburgh soils have dominantly channer-size  rock fragments.  Tiban soils have a Bk horizon.  Timmercrek soils are  moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.  Tineman soils have very  gravelly sand at 26 to 35 inches.  Wareagle soils have an O horizon and  slightly or moderately acid in the Bw horizon.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Klug soils are on foothills and mountain sides and have slopes of  5 to 70 percent.  Elevations are 4,300 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from quartzite, slate and granitic material.  The climate is cold  and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer.  Average  annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 22 inches. Average summer air  temperature is 53 to 60 degrees F, and the average annual air  temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 10 to 60 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lag series and the Parkay and Zeale soils. Parkay soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 16 inches and argillic horizons.  Zeale soils have calcic horizons within or  immediately under the mollic epipedon.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff;  moderate or moderately rapid permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used dominantly for rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly three tip sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, and  Idaho fescue.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East central Idaho.  It is of moderate  extent.
