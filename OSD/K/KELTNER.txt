KELTNER SERIES

The Keltner series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on unglaciated hillside benches and rounded ridge tops.  These soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum weathered from shale.  The mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Keltner silt loam on a west-facing 4 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 277 meters (907 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 38 to 89 cm (15 to 35 inches).]

	2Bt4--97 to 104 cm (38 to 41 inches); mixed light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4), greenish gray (5G 6/1), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) clay; moderate medium and coarse angular blocky structure; very firm; few faint olive gray (5Y 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. [5 to 31 cm (2 to 12 inches) thick]

	2Cr--104 to 152 cm (41 to 60 inches); mixed olive (5Y 5/3), greenish gray (5BG 6/1), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/8), thinly bedded clayey shale containing many fragments of limestone in discontinuous layers ranging from 1 to 3 inches in thickness; horizontal cleavage planes with light greenish gray (5G 7/1) fillings and coats; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Assumption, Aviston, Barrington, Blackberry, Buckhart, Catlin, Clare, Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont, Harrison, Saybrook, and Totanang series. None of the competing series have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). In addition, Assumption, Catlin, Dana, and Saybrook soils formed in loess and the underlying till and contain less clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Barrington soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy outwash and contain less clay in the lower part of the series control section. Harrison soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy sediments at the surface of Illinoian till that contains a strongly weathered paleosol and have less clay in the lower part of the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Keltner soils are on unglaciated hillside benches and rounded ridge tops. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Keltner soils formed in 30 to 50 inches of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from calcareous clayey shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.1 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 914 mm (32 to 36 inches). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Calamine, Loran, Massbach, Schapville, and Tama soils. Calamine soils are poorly drained, dominated by grayer colors and are on nearly level parts of the broader ridges. Loran soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on similar landscape positions. Massbach soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions. Schapville soils have shale bedrock within 102 cm (40 inches) and are on similar landscape positions. Tama soils are well drained, do not have shale bedrock within 152 cm (60 inches), and are on upper side slopes or ridge tops above Keltner soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained.  Low to very high runoff.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the residuum. Permeability is moderate in the loess and slow in the residuum.  The depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 91 cm (2 to 3 feet) during February to June in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow are the principal crops. Native vegetation is prairie grass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Illinois, southeastern Minnesota, and southwestern Wisconsin; LRR?s K and M, MLRAs 95B, 105, 108. These soils are of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 inches) (Ap and A horizons); 
Argillic horizon - from 33 to 104 cm (13 to 41 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons); 
Paralithic contact with shale at a depth of 104 cm (41 inches).
