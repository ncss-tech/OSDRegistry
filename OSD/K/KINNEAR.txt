KINNEAR SERIES

The Kinnear series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 191 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Kinnear clay loam in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 25 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 25 cm thick)

    Bw--25 to 58 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few thin glossy patches on faces of some peds and discontinuous glossy patches in root channels; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (23 to 61 inches thick)

    BCk--58 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; carbonate concretions and fine threadlike masses in the matrix and between peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sandy clay loam or loam
Reaction: 7.9 to 9.0

COMPETING SERIES:
Defenbaugh (OR) - have a horizon of secondary silica accumulation; have a lithologic discontinuity
Hostage (UT) - have a paralithic contact at depths of 100 to 150 cm; have a lithologic discontinuity 
Pavillion (WY) - have a paralithic contact at depths of 50 to 100 cm
Rabbitcreek (OR) - have a lithologic discontinuity; contain more than 50 percent silt and more than 25 percent pararock fragments in the lower part of the subsoil
Tewa (AZ) - have a lithologic discontinuity; have a mean annual soil temperature higher than 10 degrees C
Turzo (UT) - do not have a horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - alluvial fans, fan remnants, and stream terraces 
Elevation - 1,085 to 1,600 meters
Slope - 0 to 10 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium or alluvium
Mean annual precipitation - 125 to 230 mm 
Mean annual air temperature - 6 to 8 degrees C
Frost-free period - 110 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Kinnear soils are used as rangeland or irrigated cropland. Native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, blue grama, and Sandberg bluegrass. Some distal landform positions have sodic soil properties which support a Gardner's saltbush plant community.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Kinnear soils are of moderate extent in northwestern Wyoming. MLRA 32.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Big Horn County (Big Horn River Irrigated Area), Wyoming, 1972.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 25 cm (Ap horizon)
Cambic horizon - from 25 to 58 cm (Bw horizon)
Secondary carbonate accumulation - from 58 to 152 cm (BCk horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (Bw and part of the BCk horizon)

Kinnear soils have a mesic temperature regime and an aridic moisture regime.

Note: The type location describes, what appear to be, ped and void surface features in the Bw horizon. The need for documentation in support of a Bw horizon, and not a Bt horizon (or a diagnostic argillic horizon), is recognized and should be investigated.
