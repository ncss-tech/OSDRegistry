KAWUNEECHE SERIES

The Kawuneeche series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over glaciofluvial deposits derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Kawuneeche soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid Fluvaquentic Cryaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kawuneeche mucky peat, on a nearly level slope in grass, sedges and rushes at an elevation of 8,712 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 28, 1997 the soil was moist throughout.

    Oe--0 to 5 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mucky peat, very dark very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; many very fine and fine roots and few medium; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    A--5 to 12 inches; black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots and few medium; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 14 inches thick)

    Cg1--23 to 31 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) coarse sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common medium irregular dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of iron concentrations throughout; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 11 inches thick)

    2Cg2--31 to 66 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loamy sand, dark greenish gray (10GY 3/1) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are presently no competing series in this family.  The similar Coal Creek(AK) and Disappoint(AK) series are in the Humic subgroup. 
Coal Creek and Disappoint soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic matter, are not affected by flooding.

Landform:  flood plains
Slopes:  0 to 4 percent

Mean annual temperature:  36 to 42 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  18 to 36 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Enentah, Fallriver and Venable series.  
The Enentah and Fallriver soils do not have an umbric epipedon and are on adjacent mountain slopes and moraines.
Venable soils have a mollic epipedon and are on flood plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  poorly drained, slow runoff, moderate permeability in the upper part, rapid in the lower part, occasional to frequently flooded for brief periods during the months of May, June and July.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Recreation and wildlife habitat.  Native plant community is dominantly planeleaf willow, tufted hairgrass, sedges, baltic rush, American mannagrass and bog birch.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Rocky Mountains, Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Grand County, Colorado, Rocky Mountain National Park soil survey area, 1999.  The name was taken from a prominent valley in the area .

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 15 to 45 inches.  (part of the Bg, Cg1, and part of the 2Cg2 horizons)
Umbric epipedon:  The zone from 5 to 23 inches.  (A and Bg horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations:  In the zone from 12 to 31 inches. (Bg and Cg1 horizons)  
Redoximorphic depletions:  In the zone from 12 to 66 inches. (Bg, Cg1, and 2Cg2 horizons)
Endosaturation:  The zone of saturation at 0 to 66 inches. (Oe, Bg, Cg1, and 2Cg2 horizons) for some time in most years.
Lithologic discontinuity:  At the upper boundary of the 2Cg2 horizon. 

Remarks:  This soil was previously classified as a Typic Cryaquoll.  Laboratory results established low base saturation and an umbric epipedon.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample(s) numbers S97CO-049-001.
