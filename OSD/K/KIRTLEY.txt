KIRTLEY SERIES

The Kirtley series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to soft bedrock. They formed in slope alluvium over calcareous residuum weathered from redbed shales and sandstone. Kirtley soils are on bedrock controlled hills, ridges, cuestas and low hills in strike valleys. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kirtley loam-rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick)

    BA--10 to 18 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few thin clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt1--18 to 28 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; continuous thin and moderately thick clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.

    Bt2--28 to 41 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium subangular blocky; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; continuous thin clay films on all faces of peds and lining pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8) clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons - 18 to 38 cm)

    Bk1--41 to 56 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few thin clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent, common soft calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--56 to 76 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent, common soft calcium carbonate masses and threads; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons - 20 to 35 cm)

    Cr--76 to 152 cm; reddish brown, weakly consolidated, calcareous shale interbedded with some olive shale.
