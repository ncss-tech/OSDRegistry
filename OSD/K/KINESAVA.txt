KINESAVA SERIES

Typically, Kinesava soils have dark grayish brown and dark brown, mildly alkaline, fine sandy loam Al horizons, and yellowish red, mildly alkaline, clay B2t horizons.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Pachic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kinesava fine sandy loam - rangeland

(Colors are for air dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    All--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine vesicular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 11 inches thick)

    A12--5 to 25 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common medium, and few fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (19 to 44 inches thick)

    A13--25 to 31; brown (7.5YR 4/2) heavy fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (O to 6 inches thick)

    Blt--31 to 39 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) light sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, plastic; few medium and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; thin clay pressure faces on peds, mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 22 inches thick)

    B21t--39 to 49 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/8) moist; moderate coarse prismatic            structure that parts to strong coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; few medium and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; thin clay pressure faces on peds; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 22 inches thick)

    B22t--49 to 60 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) clay, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky, very plastic; few medium and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; thin clay pressure faces on peds; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8) .

Type Location: Washington County, Utah; approximately 1,800 feet north and 400 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 13, T.41S., R.10W.

Range in Characteristics: The upper boundary of the argillic horizon ranges from 27 to 40 inches below the mineral surface. The mollic epipedon is 30 to 40 inches thick. The solum is 42 to 60 inches or more thick. The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 62 to 65 degrees F. The soils are usually moist during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section for 35 to 50 days during the summer months, and are dry for 60 to 75 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice. The soils range from neutral to moderately alkaline.

The Al horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist. It is commonly fine sandy loam, but ranges to sandy loam or light sandy clay loam. Some pedons have a weak A2 horizon.

The B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is clay or sandy clay.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Elzinga and Maughan series. Elzinga and Maughan soils have thick A2 horizons. Elzinga soils contain 35 to 60 percent cobble and gravel in the control section. Maughan soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.

SETTING: Kinesava soils are on mountain slopes, valleys and mesa tops at elevations of 6,200 to 8,000 feet. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone with some added eolian material from sandstone. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches. Frost-free period is about 90 to 120 days.

PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED: These are the Detra, Kolob, and Paunsaugant soils.  Detra soils have sandy clay loam argillic horizons with an upper boundary less than 24 inches below the mineral surface. Kolob soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent coarse fragments. Paunsaugant soils are less than 20 inches thick to bedrock, lack argillic horizons and have control sections with more than 35 percent coarse fragments.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; slow runoff; moderate and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as rangeland and recreation areas. Vegetation is Gambel oak, juniper, sagebrush, serviceberry, snowberry, peavine, bluegrass, needlegrass, and mountain brome grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah. This series is inextensive.
