KARMA SERIES

The Karma series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments on stream terraces of Pleistocene age in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B) and Arkansas Valley and Ridges (MLRA 118A and 118B).  These soils are on broad level through moderately steep terraces.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range up to 20 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Karma fine sandy loam--cultivated.        (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) dry; weak fine granular structure; hard, very friable; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 18 inches thick)

     Bt1--11 to 30 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

     Bt2--30 to 52 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; nearly continuous clay films on faces of peds; moderately acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)

     BC--52 to 65 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; few clay films bridging sand grains; moderately acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Bryan County, Oklahoma; about 11 miles south and 5 miles east of Boswell, Oklahoma.  About 1550 feet east and 150 feet south of the northwest corner in sec. 18, T. 8 S., R. 15 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.

The A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is less than 7 inches thick in pedons where the value is 3 and the chroma is 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy fine sand.

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam, and the clay content ranges from 24 to 35 percent.

The BC horizon is similar in color to the B2t horizon.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.

In some pedons, a C horizon occurs and has colors similar to the Bt horizon.  It is stratified and textures range from loamy fine sand to sandy clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bosket and Poindexter series.  Bosket soils contains Bt and BC horizons with hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Poindexter soils have 14 to 36 inch sola over hard, basic hornblende gneiss bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Karma soils are on broad level through moderately steep stream terraces in the Western Coastal Plains (MLRA 133B) and Arkansas Valley and Ridges (MLRA 118A and 118B).  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 52 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 65 degrees F.; Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 80.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Larton, Okay, Redport, and Ships series.  Larton soils are on higher terraces or the outer edge of the same terrace and have B3 horizons that do not decrease more than 20 percent in clay content from the maximum in the B2t horizons and have A horizons more than 20 inches thick. Okay soils are on the back part of the terraces.  Redport and Ships soils are usually on lower terraces.  Okay and Ships soils have a mollic epipedon.  Redport soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Ships soils are clayey.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff ranges from negligible through medium; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Primarily cropland or pasture.  Soybeans, cotton, peanuts, grain sorghum, and wheat are the main cultivated crops.  Bermudagrass is the principal pasture grass.  Native vegetation is mostly oak, elm, hackberry, and hickory with an understory of grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Oklahoma, possibly Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bryan County, Oklahoma; 1975.

REMARKS:  Karma soils were formerly mapped as the Teller series and classified in the Reddish Prairie great soil group.  These soils differ from Teller soils by lacking a mollic epipedon and having a udic moisture regime.

Soil Interpretation Record:  Series    OK0125

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Ap horizon). Argillic horizon - The zone from 11 inches to a depth of 52 inches (Bt horizons).
