KINN SERIES

The Kinn series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 46 to 91 cm (18 to 36 inches) of recent light colored alluvium overlying a buried dark colored soil on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Oxyaquic Udifluvents

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Other series in related families are the Algiers and Sligo soils. Algiers soils are shallower to aquic conditions and have redox depletions higher in the control section. Sligo soils do not have carbonates in the upper part of the control section and do not have a buried soil within the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kinn soils are on flood plains associated with the Wisconsinan or Illinoian till plain where the headwaters are in the Wisconsinan materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 46 to 91 cm (18 to 36 inches) of recent light colored, calcareous alluvium overlying a buried Mollisol. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 145 to 181 days. Elevation is 219 to 238 meters (720 to 780 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Eldean, Fox, Gessie, and Ockley soils. Eldean, Fox, and Ockley soils are well drained and are on nearby outwash terraces. Gessie soils are well drained and are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the recent alluvium and moderately slow in the buried soil. The soil is subject to occasional or frequent flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Kinn soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans and wheat are the principal crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods tolerant of flooding conditions.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Ohio; MLRA 111A. The series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ross County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: Areas of Kinn soils were previously mapped as Algiers soils. These soils were initially placed in the fine-silty family textural class.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).
Buried soil: at 51 cm (top of the Ab1 horizon).
Aquic conditions: iron depletions or gleyed matrix below a depth of 96 cm.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for RO-103, the typifying pedon, from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.
