KANCAN SERIES



The Kancan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately

slowly permeable soils that are formed in mixed alluvium.  They are on

coalesced fan terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 12 percent.  The average

annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual

temperature is about 46 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calciargidic Argixerolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Kancan gravelly silt loam--rangeland.  On a 3 percent

single slope, east aspect, 4700 feet elevation.  (Colors are for air

dry soil unless otherwise stated.  This profile was described June 5,

1980.)

grayish brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure

parting to strong very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly

sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many

very fine irregular pores; 20 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH

7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)



    A2--3 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, very dark

grayish brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure

parting to strong very fine granular; hard, friable, sticky, and

plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine and few fine irregular

pores; 20 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy

boundary.  (3 to 11 inches thick)

brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure;

hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very

fine and few fine irregular pores; 45 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline

(pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 9 inches thick)



    2Bk--16 to 27 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly

coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very

friable, slightly sticky, and plastic; few very fine roots; many very

fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; 45 percent pebbles; mildly

alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 11 inches thick)



    3Ck1--27 to 33 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly coarse

sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very

friable; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; strongly

effervescent (10 percent calcium carbonate) common fine and medium

irregularly shaped soft lime seams and masses; 20 percent pebbles and

30 percent cobbles; rock fragments coated with lime on all sides;

moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (14 to 20 inches

thick)



    3Ck2--33 to 64 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very cobbly

coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft and very

friable; many very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent (10

percent calcium carbonate) common fine and medium irregularly shaped

soft lime seams and masses; 20 percent pebbles and 35 percent cobbles;

rock fragments coated with lime on all sides; moderately alkaline (pH

8.4).



TYPE LOCATION:  Cassia County, Idaho; about 2 miles northwest of Malta,

Idaho, 2500 feet south, 200 feet west of the northeast corner of

section 34, T. 12 S., R. 26 E.

textures)

coarse sand

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mountainville, Pagari, and Red Butte

series.  Mountainville soils have rock fragments that are dominantly

stones and they lack discontinuities to coarse material.  Pagari soils

have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches, and lacks a discontinuity to

coarser material.  Red Butte soils are weakly to strongly cemented in

the Bk horizon.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kancan soils are on nearly level to moderately

sloping coalesced fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.

Elevation ranges from 4400 to 5500 feet.  The soil formed in mixed

alluvium with some loess influence.  The average annual precipitation

ranges from 10 to 12 inches, the average annual air temperature is

about 45 to 47 degrees F., the frost free season is 90 to 120 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Darkbull, Declo, Nibbs

(T), and Womack (T) series. These soils are on coalesced fan terraces.

All of these soils lack mollic epipedons.  Darkbull, Declo and Nibbs

soils lack argillic horizons. Declo soils lack a skeletal

discontinuity. Womack soils have a duripan at 20 to 40 inches.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Moderately slow permeability

through the Bt horizons and moderately rapid to rapid below. Medium

runoff.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Kancan soils are used for range, irrigated crops

and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is low sagebrush, bluebunch

wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and rabbitbrush.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Idaho. The soils of this series

are not extensive.
