KNOBBY SERIES 

The Knobby series consists of shallow and very shallow, well and somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands. These soils are in glade areas and formed in thin loamy residuum from the underlying arenaceous dolomite and limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Knobby gravelly loam - on a 5 percent slope in rangeland (open glade) at an elevation of 930 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Al--0 to 3 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 30 percent dolomite fragments (10 percent greater than 3 inches); slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. 

    A2--3 to 7 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) very gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 45 percent dolomite fragments (10 percent greater than 3 inches); slightly alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. 

    R--7 inches; hard fractured dolostone  

TYPE LOCATION: Benton County, Missouri, about 15 miles southeast of Warsaw, 2500 feet west and 300 feet south of the northeast corner, sec. 19, T. 39 N., R. 20 W.; USGS Cross Timber, Missouri quadrangle, lat. 38 degrees 7 minutes 16 seconds N. and long. 93 degrees 9 minutes 45 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to Bedrock: 4 to 20 inches
Particle size control section: Averages 5 to 18 percent clay 

A horizon
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 to 3
Fine-earth: loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or sandy loam.
Total rock fragments: 10 to 85 percent; 10 to 85 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 60 percent flags or channers
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Elizabeth and Moko series.  Similar soils are the Balltown, Gasconade, and Swink series.  Elizabeth, Moko and Gasconade soils have more clay.  Balltown and Swink soils are thermic. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on sloping to steep dissected landscapes and commonly are in isolated glade areas.  Slope gradients typically are 15 to 35 percent, but range from 2 to 50 percent.  Knobby soils formed in thin loamy residuum from the underlying arenaceous dolomite or limestone.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bardley, Doniphan, Gatewood, and Goss soils.  All of these soils are deeper to bedrock and surround areas of the Knobby soils. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well and somewhat excessively drained. Runoff is high or very high. Permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in native grasses with sparse cedar and low quality oaks. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ozarks region (MLRAs 116A and 116B) of Missouri and possibly adjoining states.  The series is of moderate extent.
