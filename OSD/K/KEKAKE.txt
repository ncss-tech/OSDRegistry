KEKAKE SERIES

The Kekake series consists of very shallow, moderately well  drained organic soils.  These soils formed in organic material mixed with minor amounts of basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 890 millimeters (35 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, isomesic, micro Lithic Ustifolists

TYPICAL PEDON: Kekake gravelly highly decomposed plant material, on a west facing, slightly concave, 14 percent slope under pasture at an elevation of 1417 meters (4,650 feet).  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  All textures are "apparent field textures." pH measured with organic dyes.  When described on July 23, 1997, the soil was moist throughout.)

    Oa--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); black (5YR 2.5/1) gravelly highly decomposed plant material; strong fine granular structure; friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine, and common medium roots; many very fine and fine pores; 15 percent gravel and 7 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.4); abrupt wavy boundary.

    2R--13 centimeters (5 inches); hard, massive pahoehoe lava.

TYPE LOCATION: Island of Hawaii, Hawaii County, Hawaii; on Kealia Ranch, drive 0.1 miles north from the first left gate at Big Hill Camp; site is 6 meters (20 feet) south from next fenceline, and 15 meters (50 feet) mauka (upslope) of 4WD road.  Kaunene Quadrangle; lat. 19 degrees 24 minutes 8.9 seconds N. and long. 155 degrees 48 minutes 52.5 seconds W. (GPS/PLGR; Old Hawaiian datum)).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to bedrock: 5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches).
Mean annual soil temperature: 13 to 15 degrees C. (55 to 59 degrees F.)
Rock fragments: 5 to 35 percent by volume and range in size from gravel to cobbles.
Organic carbon (by weight): 25 to 30 percent of the less than 2.0 mm soil material.

Oa horizon
Hue: 5YR to 10YR.
Value: 2 or 3 moist or dry.
Chroma: 1 or 2 moist or dry.
Texture: Cobbly or gravelly highly decomposed plant material.
Soil reaction: Very strongly acid or strongly acid (pH 4.5 to 5.5).

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Puuiki series.  Puuiki soils are moist in the control section from January through July.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kekake soils are on upper elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from 1067 to 2133 meters (3500 to 7000 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 508 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1016 to 1778 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 57 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Hapuu, Hokukano, Kealoha, Manahaa, Mawae, and Puukala series.  Hapuu soils are sandy-skeletal.  Hokukano and Manahaa soils are medial.  Kealoha and Puukala soils are medial-skeletal.  Mawae soils are organic soils over `a`a lava.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained.  Runoff is negligible in depressions on gentle slopes and high to very high on steeper slopes.  Permeability is rapid in the soil and very slow in the underlying bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazing and wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is kikuyugrass (Pennisetum clandestinum) and brackenfern (Pteridium aquilinum).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North and South Kona districts, Island of Hawaii; MLRA 159 and 161.  The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Island of Hawaii, Hawaii County, Hawaii, 1971.

REMARKS: Soil moisture - usually moist, but dry in some or all parts totaling 90 or more days during the months of October through April in most years (Ustic moisture regime).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Sapric soil materials - from 0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches) (Oa horizon).
Lithic contact - at 13 centimeters (5 inches) (2R horizon).

ADDITIONAL DATA: NASIS Pedon User ID 93HI002018. NSSL sample S97HI-001-011.  The lab data is borderline Lithic Haplustands, but the typical concept of Kekake is  Lithic Ustifolists.
