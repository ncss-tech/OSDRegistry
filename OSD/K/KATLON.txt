KATLON SERIES

The Katlon series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous materials and shale.  Katlon soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 25 to 45 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 32 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Katlon silt loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    0--4 inches to 0; decomposing needles and litter.

    A1--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

     A2--6 to 14 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    E--14 to 27 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; common thin silt coats on faces of peds; slightly acid (p.H 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt1--27 to 34 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine and very fine flattened roots; few very fine vesicular pores; common thick clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid (p.H 5.4); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick.)

    Bt2--34 to 80 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist, few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) mottles; moderate coarse prismatic parting to moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots, few very fine vesicular pores; common very thick clay films on faces of peds; very strongly acid (p.H 4.6).

TYPE LOCATION: Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. About 9 miles east of Ensenado, New Mexico. 106 degrees, 28 minutes, 8 seconds west longitude; 36 degrees, 41 minutes, 44 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  The soil is moist in at least some parts of the soil moisture control section November through May and July through September.

Soil Temperature:  37 to 42 degrees F.

Summer soil temperature:  44 to 47 degrees F.

Particle Size Control Section:  Clay content is 35 to 45 percent and rock fragment is 0 to 10 percent by volume.

Mollic epipedon:  10 to 16 inches thick.

Base Saturation:  Below 50 percent by Ammonium Acetate in some part of the Bt horizon within 70 inches of the soil surface.

A horizon:  2 or 3 dry or moist. Chroma:  1 or 2
Reaction:  neutral

E horizon:  Value - 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist. Chroma:  3 or 4 Rock fragments:  0 to 5 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  Reaction:  slightly acid.
Bt horizon:  Hue - 10YR or 7.5YR Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.  Chroma:  3 or 4. Texture:  silty clay loam or silty  clay. Rock fragments:  0 to 5 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  Reaction: strongly or very strongly acid, commonly decreasing with depth.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family to date.  Mudbuz (CO) soils are similar.  Mudbuz soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Katlon soils formed in colluvium from igneous and sedimentary rock on mountain slopes that have undergone mass wasting.  Slopes range from 25 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 28 to 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F.  Elevations are 8,500 to 9,900 feet and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Angostura, Gromes, Nabor and Elbeth series.  Angostura and Gromes soils are skeletal.  Nabor soils are on toeslopes of mountains and have calcium carbonates within 20 to 37 inches from the surface.  Elbeth soils are on toeslopes of mountains and have 15 to 30 percent rock fragment in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Katlon soils are used mainly for wood production and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is white fir and aspen with an understory of mountain brome, peavine, snowberry and Gambel oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central, New Mexico.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, 1989.

REMARKS:  This soil was origionally classified as a mollisol without regard to base status.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:

Mollic epipedon:  The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches.  (A horizon)

Albic horizon: The zone from 14 to 27 inches. (E horizon)

Argillic horizon:  The zone from 27 inches to 60 inches. (Bt horizon)

Low base saturation:  base saturation less than 50 percent in Bt horizons.
