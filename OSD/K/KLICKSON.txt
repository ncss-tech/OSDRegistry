2/2004--The Klickson series was revised to remove the discontinuity in the Bt1 horizon based on the highly mixed influence of ash and lack of a mantle of ash.

6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
