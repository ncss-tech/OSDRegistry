KAJOE SERIES

The Kajoe series consists of very deep somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy granitic alluvium. Kajoe soils are on inset fans and footslopes of erosional fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 9 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., the mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, thermic Typic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Kajoe coarse sand at an elevation of 2300 feet. (When described on October 3, 1994 the soil was dry throughout. Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 1 inch; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common fine and medium vesicular pores; 10 percent 2 to 5 millimeter and few 5 to 20 millimeter subrounded igneous-granite gravel; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A2--1 to 7 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; 5 percent 2 to 5 millimeter subrounded igneous-granite gravel; noneffervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 1 to 9 inches.)

    C1--7 to 27 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium fine roots; 5 percent 2 to 5 millimeter subrounded igneous-granite gravel; few medium and coarse rounded light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) slightly hard insects casts; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.

    C2--27 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; 5 percent 2 to 5 millimeter subrounded igneous-granite gravel; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.5). (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 51 to 59 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION: San Bernardino County, California; near Twentynine Palms; about 1250 feet west and 2200 feet south of the northeast corner of section 3, T. 2 N., R. 7 E; 34 degrees 17 minutes 19.7 seconds north latitude and 116 degrees 14 minutes 00.9 second west longitude. UTM 05-705.42 E. and 37-944.49 N.(Deadman Lake Southwest quadrangle.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soil moisture - Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to October following convection storms.

Soil temperature - 68 to 70 degrees F.
Textural control section - Sand content: 25 to 40 percent very coarse and coarse sand.
Silt plus clay content: 10 to 15 percent.
Rock fragments: 5 to 15 percent weighted average, dominantly 2 to 20 millimeter size.

A Horizon - Value: 6 or 7 dry and 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry and moist.
Effervescence: Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.

C Horizons - Value: 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry and moist.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bluepoint (NV), Brazito (NM), Cajon (CA), Maynard Lake (NV), Moapa (NV), Pintura (UT) Toquop (NV), University (T) (NM) and Yturbide (NM) series. Bluepoint soils have control sections that are loamy fine sand or fine sand. Brazito, University and Yturbide soils are moist for more than 20 cumulative days in the summer. Cajon soils are moist for short periods in the winter and spring and are dry from summer to mid-fall. Maynard Lake soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 62 degrees F. and have more than 20 percent volcanic ash and pumice in the control section. Moapa soils are moderately deep to sandstone. Pintura and Toquop soils have control sections that are fine sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kajoe soils are on inset fans and footslopes of erosional fan remnants. These soils formed in sandy granitic alluvium. Elevations are 1860 to 2860 feet. Slopes are on 2 to 9 percent.    The climate is warm and arid, with hot, dry summers and cool winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 66 to 68 degrees F., the mean July air temperature is about 88 degrees F., the mean January air temperature is about 49 degrees F. and the frost free season is 220 to 260 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS ARE: These are the proposed Cax (T CA), Desfirex (T CA), Macagce (T CA), and Narea (T CA) soils. Cax and Desfirex soils have argillic and calcic horizons. Macagce and Narea soils have durinodes and calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very low to low runoff; rapid permeability; rare flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly white bursage, creosotebush, and big galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern California. These soils are not extensive. MLRA 30.
