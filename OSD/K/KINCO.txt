KINCO SERIES 

The Kinco series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy material of eolian or alluvial origin.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocalcids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Kinco fine sandy loam - rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

    A--0 to 8 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; common roots; few pores and insect burrows; few very fine weakly cemented calcium carbonate concretions; effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary (6 to 15 inches thick).

    Bw--8 to 32 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; few fine roots; few pores and insect burrows; few fine weakly cemented concretions and fine films and threads of calcium carbonate; effervescent; moderately alkaline; diffuse smooth boundary (18 to 30 inches thick).

    Bk--32 to 52 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky; few fine pores; contains 20 percent by volume of weakly cemented concretions; common soft masses, threads and films of calcium carbonate; few igneous pebbles; effervescent; moderately alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary (6 to 50 inches thick).

    BCk--52 to 66 inches plus; pink (7.5YR 7/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky; about 5 percent by volume of weakly cemented concretions and soft masses of calcium carbonate; effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Ward County, Texas; from intersection of U.S. Highway 80 and Texas Highway 115 in Pyote, Texas, 7.4 miles west on U.S. Highway 80 to ranch road, 1.4 miles north on ranch road, 150 yards west of in rangeland. Site is 100 yards south of John Wilson ranch boundary fence.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Depth to a calcic horizon: 24 to 40 inches

All horizons are calcareous

Rock fragments: 0 to 25 percent igneous or limestone gravel

Soil moisture: These soils are usually dry, but are assumed to be dry in all parts of the moisture control section of less than 3/4 of the time. Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Silicate clay content: 10 to 18 percent

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand

Bw horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam
Calcium carbonate: a few to about 10 percent

Bk horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam
Calcium carbonate: 15 to 60 percent by volume of soft masses, threads and weakly cemented concretions

BCk horizon
Color: similar to the Bk horizon
Texture: similar to the Bk horizon
Calcium carbonate: at least 5 percent less carbonates than the Bk above.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bilgray (AZ), Geta (NV), Luckyhills (AZ), Potrillo (I-TX) and Stronghold (AZ) series. Bilgray soils have dense and compacted sediments within 45 to 55 inches of the soil surface. Geta soils are in the Mohave Desert Luckyhills and Stronghold soils have calcic horizons that occur at depth less than 20 inches and are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September. Portrillio soils are inactive.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Kinco soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping and gently undulating uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous loamy eolian or alluvial sediments.  The climate is arid to semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 69 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 140 to 250 days and elevation ranges from 1,500 to 5,300 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 10 to 23.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Monahans, Pyote, and Wickett soils.  Monahans soils have more than 18 percent clay in the series control section.  Pyote soils have noncalcareous sandy A horizons that are more than 20 inches thick.  Wickett soils have a petrocalcic horizon within a depth of 40 inches.  They are all on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and very low on 1 to 3 percent.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Principal grasses are perennial threeawn, sand dropseed, and black grama.  Sandsage, yucca, and scattered mesquite trees are the woody plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West Texas. MLRA 42. The series is of moderate extent.
