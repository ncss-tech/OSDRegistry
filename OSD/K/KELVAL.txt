KELVAL SERIES

The Kelval series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium weathered mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Torrifluventic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kelval fine sandy loam, on a 1 percent slope under irrigated alfalfa at 2,690 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on December 5, 1985, the soil was moist throughout).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common medium, fine and very fine roots; few very fine interstitial and tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    A--7 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5) clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 17 inches thick)

    C1--13 to 24 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stratified loamy sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    C2-24 to 33 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stratified loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and few very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear irregular boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    C3--33 to 48 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) stratified sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 25 inches thick)

    C4--48 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) stratified sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak moderate subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent, disseminated carbonates; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Kern County, California; near the southeast corner of a power station, about 2,400 feet west and 1,800 feet north of southeast corner of Sec. 18, T.26S., R.35E., MDB&M, Weldon Quadrangle; lat. 35 degrees 39 minutes 54 seconds N and long. 118 degrees 15 minutes 42 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil Moisture - The moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May 1 until about November 30, (about 217 days).  It is moist for about 80 days when the soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F. Organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth.

Soil Temperature - 59 to 63 degrees F.

Mollic epipedon thickness - 10 to 17 inches

Control section - Texture averages loamy sand or loamy fine sand with 4 to 10 percent clay.

Reaction - Neutral to moderately alkaline

Rock Fragments - less than 15 percent mainly gravel size (2-10mm)

A horizon    Hue: 10YR    Value and Chroma: 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3 dry; and 3/2 or 3/3 moist    Texture: fine sandy loam or loamy sand    Effervescence: none or slight

C horizon    Hue: 10YR    Value and Chroma: 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, or 6/3 dry; and 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 or 4/3 moist.
Texture: sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.
Effervescence: none to strong


COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kelval soils are on flood plains with slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium weathered mainly from granitic rocks but some volcanic and metasedimentary rocks are included.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and mild moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  The mean January temperature is 42 degrees F., mean July temperature is 77 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 175 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grangeville, and Chollawell (T) soils.  Grangeville soils occur in basin areas and are coarse-loamy with a water table at less than 40 inches.  Chollawell soils have an argillic horizon and occur on alluvial fans and fan terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used for irrigated alfalfa, homesite development, and livestock grazing.  The vegetation is rabbitbrush, annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kelso Valley, California.  Kelval soils are of small extent in MLRA 18 and 29.
