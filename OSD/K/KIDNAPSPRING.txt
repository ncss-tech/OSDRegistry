KIDNAPSPRING SERIES

The Kidnapspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain backslopes.  Kidnapspring soils are formed in a mixed volcanic ash mantle overlying clay-producing tuffs.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kidnapspring ashy sandy loam - woodland, on a 29 percent northwestfacing slope at an elevation of 3,920 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Andic soil materials are apparent field textures.)
