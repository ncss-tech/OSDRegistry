KIPSON SERIES

The Kipson series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from calcareous silty shales. Kipson soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 840 millimeters (33 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Udorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kipson silty clay loam, on a west-facing, convex, 12 percent slope in native grassland at an elevation of 448 meters (1470 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine and very fine roots; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

   AC--20 to 33 centimeters (8 to 13 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; common fine and very fine roots; 10 percent gravel, mostly shale; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

   C--33 to 48 centimeters (13 to 19 inches); yellow (10YR 7/6) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) channery silty clay loam, brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; few fine and very fine roots; roots spread horizontally on contact with Cr horizon; 30 percent gravel, mostly shale; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

   Cr--48 to 76 centimeters (19 to 30 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) and yellow (10YR 7/6) shale and chalky limestone; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Morris County, Kansas.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Residuum derived from weathered calcareous silty shales.
Landform: hillslopes on uplands
Slopes: Commonly 1 to 15 percent and range to 70 percent
Mean annual air temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 640 to 840 millimeters (25 to 33 inches)
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 165 to 185 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Armo, Benfield, Clime, Irwin, Sogn, and Tully soils.
Armo and Tully soils are deep and are on footslopes.
Benfield soils are moderately deep and occur on gentle slopes immediately above the Kipson soils.
Clime soils are moderately deep and are on similar landscape positions as Kipson soils.
Irwin soils are deep and are higher on landscape above Kipson soils.
Sogn soils have lithic contact and occurs immediately above Kipson soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: Somewhat excessively
Runoff: Medium to very high
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly used for native rangeland. Native vegetation is mid and short grasses with some tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North-central and northeastern Kansas and southeastern and south-central Nebraska.  Land Resource Regions H, Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region and M, Central Feed Grains and Livestock Region; Major Land Resource Areas 74, 75, 76, and 106. The series is extensive, about 150,000 acres.
