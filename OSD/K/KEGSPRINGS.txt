KEGSPRINGS SERIES

The Kegsprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed igneous and interbedded, sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Kegsprings very gravelly loam, forested.  This profile was described on a 32 percent slope at an elevation of 2412 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oi--0 to 9 cm; slightly decomposed forest litter; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 cm thick)

    A--9 to 22 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (9 to 20 cm thick)

   Bw1--22 to 62 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

   Bw2--62 to 94 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of Bw horizons - 60 to 80 cm thick)

   BC--94 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 55 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2).
