KEGEL SERIES

The Kegel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium of mixed mineralogy. Kegel soils are in narrow stream flood plains, alluvial fans, and depressions. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 675 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluvaquentic Haploxerolls

TYPE LOCATION:  Stevens County, Washington; along Hande Creek, Colville National Forest; southeast 1/4 northwest 1/4 sec. 13 T. 36 N., R. 41 E., WM. Latitude - 48 degrees, 37 minutes, 26.53 seconds, North; Latitude - 117 degrees, 34 minutes, 42.72 seconds, West; WGS84; USGS Lake Gillette Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm ranges from 6.0 to 7.8 degrees C. The soils are usually moist and are saturated during winter and early spring but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice. The soil is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  The control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kegel soils are on bottom lands incised by intermittent or perennial streams at elevations of 750 to 1,225 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in recent alluvium derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks and volcanic ash. These soils are in a continental climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C. The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 900 mm.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aits, Bonner, Chamokane, Martella, Narcisse, and Newbell soils. Aits, Banner, Martella and Newbell soils have a ochric epipedon and have a regular decrease in organic carbon. Chamokane and Narcisse soils also have a mesic soil temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; very slow runoff or ponded; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity. A high water table is near the surface during the winter and spring.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazable woodland, wildlife habitat, watershed, recreation, and dryland cropland. Dominant vegetation is Douglas-fir, grand fir, western larch and Engelman spruce with an understory of spirea, common snowberry, sedge, Kentucky bluegrass, Oregon-grape, strawberry, longtube twinflower, queencup beadlily, Solomon's seal and devil's club.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. Series is small in extent. MLRA 43A.
