COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chuckanut, Constitution, Menzel, Sadie, and Skipjack series. Chuckanut is deep and very deep to metasedimnetary bedrock.  Constitution is moderately deep to metasedimentary bedrock. Menzel and Skipjack soils are very deep. Sadie soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Kapowsin soils are on convex or undulating glacial till plains and moraines at elevations from 15 to 275 meters. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift with an influence of ash over dense glaciomarine deposits. They occur in a mild marine climate having an average annual precipitation ranging from 762 to  1270 mm. Mean January temperature is 4 degrees C; mean July temperature is 14 degrees C; and mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. The summers are cool and dry. Winters are mild and wet with most of the annual precipitation occurring as rain from November through March. The frost-free season is about 150 to 220 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alderwood Bellingham, Bow, Everett, Indianola, Kitsap, and Norma soils. Everett, Indianola, and Norma soils are very deep . Bellingham and Bow soils are in a fine family. Kitsap soils are in a fine-silty family. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; moderate permeability to the cemented horizon which is very slowly permeable. A perched water table is as high as 28 to 61 cm at times from December through June. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for cropland, hay, pasture, urban development, woodland, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, red alder, and bigleaf maple, with an understory of trailing blackberry, salal, creambush oceanspray, western brackenfern, western swordfern, vine maple, Oregon-grape, red huckleberry, and evergreen blackberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Puget lowlands in west central Washington. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS
Diagnostic horizons and features include: 
Ochric epipedon:  0 to 18 cm
Cambic horizon: 18 to 64 cm
Cemented pan: 64 to 74 cm. 
Densic materials: 74 to 150 cm
Volcanic ash: 0 to 38 cm
Oxyaquic feature:  perched water table at 28 to 61 cm at times from December through June.
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 64 cm. 

7/2013: The OSD was updated as part of the SDSJR initiative. Units were changed to metric and the range in characteristics was formatted to semi-tabular. More laboratory data needs to be collected to justify current classification.  

2000: Classification revised 1/200 from Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Andic Durochrepts to a Coarse-loamy isotic, mesic Andic Dystroxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy. Depths to diagnostic horizons and features noted in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.

This series needs further clarification as to the range in which redox depletions (chroma <2) can be found. As defined presently, if depletions occur between 50 and 75 cm, aquic subgroup criteria would be met. This pedon does not meet Aquic subgroup criteria.

1994: Classification changed from a Coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic ortstein Aquic Haplorthods to aa Coarse-loamy, mized, mesic Andic Durochrepts because of 1994 amendments to Soil Taxonomy.   The Cr horizon was changed to Cd at that time
