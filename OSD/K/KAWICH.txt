KAWICH SERIES

The Kawich series consists of deep and very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand derived from mixed rocks. Kawich soils are on stabilized dunes.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kawich fine sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; many micro and very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    C1--5 to 25 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and many very fine and fine roots; many micro and very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 150 cm)

    C2--25 to 117 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few medium and many very fine and fine roots; many micro and very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 125 cm thick)

    2C--117 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; strong thin platy structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular and few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada.  About 300 feet west of the northeast corner of section 22, T. 3 S., R. 55 E.; USGS White Blotch Springs NE 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 40 minutes 44 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 46 minutes 14 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.6788889 latitude, -115.770555 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, but moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms, typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to strongly contrasting layers: 100 to over 300 cm.

Particle-size control section - Averages fine sand, but may contain strata of sand or loamy fine sand.

A horizon 
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4, dry or moist.

C horizon 
Hue 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 through 8 dry; 4 through 7 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4, dry or moist.
Consistence: Hard or loose dry, very friable or loose moist.
Structure:  Massive or single grain.
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.
Soil reaction: Slightly alkaline through very strongly alkaline.
Other features: Contains significant amounts of pyroclastic material.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Als, Ecklund, Hawsley, Isolde, Kawake, Razito, Sheppard, Stumble, Sundown, Tipper, Tipperary, Tricera and Yenrab series.  

Als soils are noncalcareous throughout and do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation.  Ecklund soils have a lithic contact at moderate depth.  Kewake soils do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation and contain 5 to 30 percent sand sized pumice. Hawsley and Isolde are not moist 10 to 20 days in the summer.  Razito soils receive more moisture during the late summer and fall and lack pyroclastic material. Sheppard soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder, and do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Stumble and Sundown soils have a loamy fine sand particle-size control section. Stumble soils also lack carbonate in the upper 25 to 38 cm and have a weak Bk horizon. Tipper soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Tipperary soils lack pyroclastic material.  Tricera soils have carbonate accumulation at a depth of 100 cm or more.  Tricera soils are neutral or slightly alkaline in the A horizon. Yenrab soils lack pyroclastic material.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kawich soils are on stabilized dunes over lake beds and playas.  These soils formed in sandy eolian material derived mainly from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,225 to 1,936 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 to 200 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free season is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the McCutchen, Penoyer and Woodrow soils.  McCutchen soils are coarse-loamy and have a calcic horizon.  Penoyer soils are coarse-silty.  Woodrow soils are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Excessively drained; negligible to low runoff; very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation mainly consists of black greasewood, fourwing saltbush, gray molly kochia, shadscale and seepweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada.  MLRA 28A, 28B, and 29.  These soils are moderately extensive.
