KAMAKOA SERIES

The Kamakoa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from alluvium from volcanic ash.  Kamakoa soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 510 centimeters (20 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C. (64 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Medial, amorphic, isothermic Humic Haplustands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Kamakoa medial very fine sandy loam, on a west facing, slightly concave, 2 percent slope, under grasses, at an elevation of 773 meters (2535 feet). (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise noted. All textures are "apparent field textures".)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kamaoa, Kapapala, Kikoni, Kiolakaa, Kula, and Waimea series. Kamaoa soils have strong structure in the A horizon and have a silty clay loam Bw horizon that is slightly to moderately plastic. Kapapala soils have a depositional, non-alluvial ashy coarse sand 2C horizon. Kikoni soils have strong granular structure in the A horizon and strong subangular blocky structure in the 2Bw horizon. Kiolakaa soils are moderately deep to pahoehoe bedrock. Kula soils have silty clay loam Bw horizons. Waimea soils do not have an alluvial C horizon and are not on flood plains.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kamakoa soils are on mid elevation, leeward slopes of Mauna Kea and Kohala shield volcanoes at elevations from 457 to 1280 meters (1500 to 4200 feet). These soils are near intermittent streams on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains on lava flows that are 65,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 381 to 762 millimeters (15 to 30 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1780 to 2030 millimeters (70 to 80 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 15 to 22 degrees C. (60 to 71 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Puu Pa, and the competing Waikaloa and Waimea series. Puu Pa soils are medial-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Runoff is very low. Permeability is rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Natural vegetation is bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), cactus (Opuntia megacantha), aalii (Dodonaea viscosa) and mountain dandelion (Taraxacum vulgare).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South Kohala District, Island of Hawaii; MLRA 157. These soils are of small extent.
