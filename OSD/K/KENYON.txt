KENYON SERIES

The Kenyon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 30 to 75 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 880 millimeters.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fillmore County, Minnesota, 1955

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A, AB, and 2Bw1 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A, AB, 2Bw1, 2Bw2, and 2BC1 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 48 centimeters (Ap, A, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 48 to 200 centimeters (2Bw1, 2Bw2, 2BC1, and 2BC2 horizons).

Range in Characteristics were edited based on available lab data during the Kenyon Soil Data Join Recorrelation Projects FY 2013.

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area. Some NSSL data supports active cation-exchange activity class.

The MLRA 104 Steering Committee approved property edits to this series in February 2004.

In parts of MLRAs 104 and 108, based on the definitions in Chapter 3 of the Soil Survey Manual, the drainage class of this soil would be well drained. Drainage class is a state interpretation.

The Kenyon soils are in the "Iowan Area," on an eroded landscape of Kansan and/or Nebraskan tills (Ruhe, Dietz, Fenton, and Hall; Report of Investigations, Iowa Geological Survey; 1968).
