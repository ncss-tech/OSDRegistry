KACKLEY SERIES

The Kackley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and mixed alluvium. They are on undulating basalt plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Kackley soils have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Kackley silt loam, pastureland; on a 1 percent slope at 5,100 feet elevation.  When described on April 6, 1989, the soil was moist throughout. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very coarse platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 2 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.

    A2--3 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate coarse platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and few fine and medium tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 7 to 18 inches)

    Bw--9 to 14 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; 2 percent pebbles; few fine irregular and common very fine and few fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--14 to 17 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; 2 percent pebbles; common very fine irregular and few very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (18 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); few fine irregularly shaped soft lime masses and disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bk2--17 to 23 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular and few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent pebbles; thin lime coatings on undersides of coarse fragments; violently effervescent (30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); few fine and medium irregularly shaped soft lime masses and soft lime seams and disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

     Bk3--23 to 32 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 5 percent pebbles and 5 percent cobbles; thin lime coatings on all surfaces of coarse fragments; violently effervescent (40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); few fine irregularly shaped soft lime seams and disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 13 to 25 inches)

     2R--32 inches; unweathered basalt.

TYPE LOCATION: Caribou County, Idaho; about 1.75 miles south of the Grace power plant; about 400 feet west and 2,050 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 33, T.10S., R.40E.

Cobble content - averages 0 to 15 percent
Stone content - averages 0 to 5 percent

A horizons

Chroma - 3 or 4 dry or moist
Reaction - mildly or moderately alkaline
Texture - SIL or L

Bk horizons
Value - 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma - 2 through 4 dry or moist
Effervescence - slight through violent
Calcium carbonate equivalent - averages 15 to 35 percent
Reaction - mildly or moderately alkaline
Texture - SIL, L, GR-L, CB-L or CB-SIL

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arbone, Blacknoll (T), Jacoby (T) and Kearl soils.  Arbone soils are very deep.  Blacknoll soils have calcic horizons containing less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and contain less than 45 percent silt.  Jacoby soils have textures of fine sandy loam and loamy sand below depths of 10 to 20 inches (the Bk horizons.  Kearl soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and have hues of 7.5YR through 2.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kackley soils are on undulating basalt plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 5,100 to 5,700 feet.  The soil formed in loess and mixed alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches, average annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F., and the frost free period is 70 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Arbone and the Iphil (T), Rexburg and Ririe soils.  Iphil soils are very deep, have a coarse-silty particle-size control section and are calcareous to the surface.  Rexburg and Ririe soils are deep and very deep and have a coarse-silty particle size control section.  Arbone soils are on similar landscape positions as Kackley, but in less convex and more plane to concave positions.  Iphil, Rexburg and Ririe soils are on similar landscape positions or on slightly higher positions than Kackley.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kackley soils are used for nonirrigated and irrigated cropland and rangeland.  The native vegetation is Mountain big sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  The soils of this series are of small extent.
