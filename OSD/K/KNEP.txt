KNEP SERIES

The Knep series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits over residuum derived from calcareous siltstone, mudstone and sandstone. Knep soils are on escarpments, hills, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Knep channery loam at 1,914 meters in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 18 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) channery loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate very fine and fine granular structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and medium roots; very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 30 percent channers; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

 Bw--18 to 43 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) channery loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, and few medium roots; very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 10 percent channers; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

 Bk--43 to 61 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) channery loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 15 percent fine irregular carbonate masses in matrix; 20 percent channers; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 70 cm thick)

 Cr--61 cm; moderately cemented sedimentary beds.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; 1.5 to 15.0 um/sec.

USE AND VEGETATION: The soil is used principally for rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass and mountain big sage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are of small extent in southwestern and central Montana. MLRAs 43B and 46.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Sweet Grass County, Montana, 1999. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 18 cm (A horizon);
Cambic horizon - 18 to 43 cm (Bw horizon);
Calcic horizon -- 43 to 61 cm (Bk horizon);
Paralithic contact -- at 61 cm (Cr horizon); and
Particle-size control section -- 25 to 61 cm (part of Bw, Bk horizons).

Knep soils have a cryic temperature regime, an ustic moisture regime, and a typic soil moisture subclass.

Additional Information: Because of the ustic moisture regime, the type location was moved from Clark County, Idaho to Sweet Grass County, Montana (5/16/2017).
