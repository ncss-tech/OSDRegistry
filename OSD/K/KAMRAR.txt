KAMRAR SERIES

The Kamrar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on convex knobs and linear side slopes. These soils formed in moderately fine or fine textured glacio-fluvial or lacustrine sediments and the underlying loamy glacial till. Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches).

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and legume hay. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Webster County, Iowa, 1969. 

REMARKS: The drainage class was changed to moderately well due to the presence of redoximorphic features above a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches). The Guckeen series was changed to being only somewhat poorly drained. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Particle-size control section--the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches);
Series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (59 inches).
Mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 38 centimeters (15 inches) (Ap and A horizons);
Cambic horizon--the zone from 38 to 137 centimeters (15 to 54 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, 2Bk1, and 2Bk2 horizons);
Udic moisture regime.
Oxyaquic subgroup based on redox features and iron and manganese concretions above a depth of 100 centimeters (40 inches). 

Some pedons may have clay films or pressure faces in the B horizon but do not meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.
