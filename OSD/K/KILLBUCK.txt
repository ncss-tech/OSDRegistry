KILLBUCK SERIES

The Killbuck series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 inches) of recent alluvium over a buried dark colored soil. These soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Killbuck silt loam, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 2Bgb1--84 to 104 cm (33 to 41 inches); dark gray (N 4/) silty clay loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure; firm; few roots; many faint gray (N 5/) coatings on faces of peds; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 2Bgb2--104 to 129 cm (41 to 51 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay loam; weak coarse prismatic structure; firm; few roots; many faint gray (N 5/) coatings on vertical faces of peds; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; slightly acid; gradual boundary. [Combined thickness of the 2Bgb horizon is 41 to 91 cm (16 to 36 inches).]

 2Cg--129 to 178 cm (51 to 70 inches); gray (5Y 5/1) silty clay loam; massive; firm; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation and common coarse distinct dark gray (N 4/) iron depletions; moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Birds and Southwest series. Birds soils do not have a buried soil within the series control section. Southwest soils formed recent alluvium overlying glaciofluvial deposits or glaciolacustrine deposits in depressions on moraines, till plains, and outwash plains in MLRAs 98 and 111.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Killbuck soils are on level or in depressional areas on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The areas are now flood plains, but some were shallow in post-glacial times. The regolith in the upper part of the profile is recent alluvium from glaciated uplands. The buried soil is of alluvial or lacustrine origin. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1092 mm (33 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Algiers, Holly, Sloan, and Wallkill soils on similar topographic positions; the Chagrin, Lobdell, and Orrville soils on nearby areas of the flood plain; and the Bogart, Chili, Conotton, Fitchville, Glenford, Lorain, Luray, Mentor, Montgomery, Sebring, and Wheeling soils. Algiers soils have chroma of 3 in part of the recent alluvium and are fine-loamy. Holly soils lack a buried dark colored A horizon and are fine-loamy. Sloan soils lack the overlying light colored recent alluvium and are fine-loamy. Wallkill soils are underlain by buried soils consisting of organic materials. The well drained Chagrin soils, the moderately well drained Lobdell soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Orrville soils are fine-loamy. They are on higher topographic positions or along higher gradient streams. Bogart, Chili, Conotton, Fitchville, Glenford, Lorain, Luray, Mentor, Montgomery, Sebring, and Wheeling soils are on nearby terraces and formed in outwash or lacustrine material.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow. The soil is subject to occasional or frequent flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Many of the larger areas of Killbuck soils have been cleared, drained, and cultivated. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Areas in permanent vegetation are used for pasture or poor quality woodland. Native vegetation is water tolerant hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern and north central Ohio; MLRAs 111E, 114A, 124, and 139. The type location is in MLRA 139. The series is of small extent, about 5,000 acres.
