KALIFONSKY SERIES

Depth class: very poorly drained
Parent material: loess over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits
Landform: depressions on till plains
Slope: 0 to 15 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 32 inches
Mean annual temperature: 32 to 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, acid Typic Cryaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Kalifonsky silt loam -- on a 1 percent concave south facing slope under black spruce forest.  (All colors are for moist soil)

    Oe--0 to 1 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moderately decomposed plant material; many very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 5 inches thick)

    A--1 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silt loam; weak very fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine faint black (2.5Y 2.5/1) redoximorphic concretions; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 12 inches thick)

    Cg1--9 to 16 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silt loam; massive; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; common medium prominent brown (10YR 4/3) redoximorphic concentrations; strongly acid (pH 5.4); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    2C--16 to 60 inches; olive (5Y 4/3) gravelly sand; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 18 percent gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Western Kenai Peninsula Area, Alaska; about 3 miles east of Kenai; in the NE1/4 of the NE1/4 section 34 T. 6 N., R 11 W.; Kenai C4 SE 1:25,000 quad; Seward Meridian; UTM north 6716616 and UTM east 599711, zone 5.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Silty mantle thickness: 14 to 30 inches

O horizon:
Matrix color: value of 2 or 3; chroma of 1 or 2
Reaction class: extremely acid to strongly acid

A horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Redoximorphic features: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 5; chroma of 1 to 4
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: very strongly acid or strongly acid

Cg horizon: hue of 10YR to 10G; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 1 or 2
Redoximorphic features: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 5; chroma of 1 to 4 more than 40 percent of the mass
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: very strongly acid or strongly acid

2C horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 or 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: sand, loamy sand modified by 10 to 30 percent total coarse fragments; 10 to 30 percent gravel; 0 to 10 percent cobbles 
Reaction class: strongly acid or moderately acid

COMPETING SERIES: There are no completing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very poorly drained
Parent material: loess over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits
Landform: depressions on till plains
Slope: 0 to 15 percent
Mean annual temperature: 32 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 14 to 32 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Chulitna, Doroshin,and Soldotna soils. Chulitna and Soldatna soils are well drained and have a reddish B horizon. Doroshin and Salamatof are very poorly drained organic soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the silty mantle is high and high to very high in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly in native vegetation. The dominant cover is black spruce forest with a ground cover of mosses and low shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands South-central Alaska. The series is of small extent.
