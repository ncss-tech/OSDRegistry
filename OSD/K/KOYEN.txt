KOYEN SERIES

The Koyen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed loamy alluvium derived dominantly from volcanic rocks with a high component of loess. Koyen soils are on fan piedmonts, fan remnants, fan skirts, alluvial fans, inset fans, basin floors, basin-floor remnants, sand sheets, and alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is approximately 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Embudo, Hessing, Monue, Quima, Unionville, and Wall series. 

Embudo soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section from December through March and July through October. Hessing soils have unconformable gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam at a depth of 38 to 64 cm. Monue soils do not have visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulations somewhere within the profile. Quima soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 0 to 5  percent below the cambic horizon.  Unionville soils have a clay content of 5 to 10 percent and a paralithic contact at 50 to 70 cm.  Wall soils have neutral or mildly alkaline sola throughout A and Bw horizons and a mean annual soil temperature of 7 to 11 degrees C. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Koyen soils are on fan piedmonts, fan remnants, fan skirts, alluvial fans, inset fans, basin floors, basin-floor remnants, sand sheets, and alluvial flats. The soils formed in alluvium derived from dominantly volcanic rocks with a high component of loess. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,310 to 2,134 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 120 to 160 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arizo, Papoose, Stumble, Tickapoo and Tolicha soils. Arizo soils are sandy-skeletal. Papoose soils have an argillic horizon. Stumble soils are sandy. Tickapoo soils have a clayey argillic horizon and strongly cemented duripan. Tolicha soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 25 to 50 cm. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low to medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The Koyen soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly bud sagebrush, spiny hopsage, winterfat, fourwing saltbush, littleleaf horsebrush, Indian ricegrass, big galleta, and lycium. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 29, 28A, 28B.
