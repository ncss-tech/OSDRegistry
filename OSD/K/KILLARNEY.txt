KILLARNEY SERIES

The Killarney series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with fragipans on foot slopes in mountainous areas. They formed in slope alluvium mixed with loess and the underlying slope alluvium or residuum derived from rhyolite or granite rocks.  Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Typic Fragiudults

TYPICAL PEDON: Killarney very cobbly silt loam, very stony - on a 17 percent northeast slope with mixed hardwood and shortleaf pine at 1,050 feet elevation.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated).

   A--2 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly silt loam; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; many fine roots; 25 percent cobbles, 15 percent gravel and stones 2 to 3 meters apart occupying about 5 percent of the surface; moderately acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

   Bt2--27 to 33 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) very cobbly silty clay loam; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; common fine roots; 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent gravel and 5 percent stones; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

   Bt3--33 to 38 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly silty clay loam; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and medium roots; common distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay films on surfaces of rock fragments and peds; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; extremely acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 12 to 24 inches.) 

   2Btx1--38 to 59 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly silt loam; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation and few fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; massive; brittle; very hard dry; many prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films lining vesicular pores; 50 percent gravel and 5 percent stones with trace of cobbles, extremely acid; diffuse wavy boundary. 

   2Btx2--59 to 80 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly silt loam; common medium distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; massive; brittle; very hard dry; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films lining vesicular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; very strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.    

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Killarney soils are on foot slopes in mountainous areas and have entrenched drainageways which aid identification of the series.  The shape of the surface up and down slope commonly is concave.  Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent. They formed in slope alluvium mixed with loess and the underlying slope alluvium or residuum derived from rhyolite or granite rocks. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delassus, Frenchmill, Irondale, Knobtop, Loughboro, Midco, and Syenite soils.  Delassus soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments and commonly are on less sloping positions.  Frenchmill soils do not have a fragipan and are on similar landscape positions as Killarney soils. Irondale, Knobtop, and Syenite soils are 20 to 40 inches over bedrock and commonly are on mountainous slopes at higher elevations.  Loughboro soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments, are poorly drained and are on nearly level uplands.  Midco soils do not have a fragipan and are on flood plains lower in the landscape. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff is high to very high.  Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan. The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and low in the fragipan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas remain forested.  Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods with some interspersed shortleaf pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The St. Francois Mountains area of the Ozarks (MLRA 116C) in southeast Missouri.  The series is of moderate extent.
