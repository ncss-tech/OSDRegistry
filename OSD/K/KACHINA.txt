KACHINA SERIES

The Kachina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate.  Kachina soils are on toeslopes of ridges and hills.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

Mcrae and Ziggy soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 50 degrees F. and have hue yellower than 7.5YR.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Kachina soils are on toeslopes of ridges and hills.   They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and fanglomerate.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Levante, Sipapu, and Yuzarra soils.  Levante soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains of valley floors.  Sipapu soils are loamy, very shallow to soft bedrock, and occur on adjacent backslopes of ridges and hills.  Yuzarra soils are sandy-skeletal, moderately deep to soft bedrock, and occur on narrow, beveled summits and shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Kachina soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is little bluestem, true mountain mahogany, sideoats grama, eriogonum, oneseed juniper, twoneedle pinyon.  The ecological site is Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma/Cercocarpus montanus-Chrysothamnus nauseosus/Bouteloua gracilis(F036XB135NM)..

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Kachina soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
