TREON SERIES

The Treon series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from underlying fine grained sandstone. Treon soils are on upland plains, dissected ridges, structural benches and escarpments.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Torriorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Treon fine sandy loam - on a NE facing convex slope of 10 percent on grassland at 5,520 feet elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (l0YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable; strong effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 23 centimeters (4 to 9 inches) thick)

  Ck--18 to 28 centimeters (7 to 11 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; lime disseminated through entire mass; violent effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 28 centimeters (2 to 11 inches) thick)

  Cr--28 to 38 centimeters (11 to 15 inches); calcareous fine grained sandstone;

TYPE LOCATION: Weld County, Colorado; about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) south and 18 kilometers (11 miles) west of Hereford; 183 meters (600 feet) south and 549 meters (1,800 feet) west of the NE corner of Sec. 35, T. 12 N., R. 64 W. U.S.G.S. Chalk Bluffs East quad.; Lat. 40 degrees, 58 minutes, 16 seconds N., and Long. 104 degrees, 31 minutes, 06 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Clay content: 10 to 20 percent 
Depth to the paralithic contact: 15 to 51 centimeters (6 to 20 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Trelona and Treoff series.
Trelona soils are noncalcareous
Treoff soils have soil temperature of 5 degrees C. (41 degrees F.) or more for 192 days or less

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Uplands
Landform: dissected plains, structural benches, ridges, and hillslopes 
Slope:  0 to 65 percent 
Parent material: residuum of weathered calcareous fine grained sandstone 
Elevation: 1372 to 1768 meters (4,500 to 5,800 feet) 
Mean annual precipitation: 30 to 41 centimeters (12 to 16 inches)
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C. (46 to 49 degrees F.) 
Frost-free season:  110 to 160 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altvan, Ascalon, Otero, Paoli, Peetz and Rosebud 
Altvan, Ascalon, and Rosebud soils have an argillic horizon. 
Otero, Paoli, and Peetz soils lack bedrock at depths of less than 51 centimeters (20 inches).

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high 
Runoff: medium 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. 
The native vegetation is sideoats grama, little bluestem, blue grama, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming. The series is of moderate extent.
