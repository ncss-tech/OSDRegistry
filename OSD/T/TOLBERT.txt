TOLBERT SERIES 

The Tolbert series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum derived from hard fine grained sandstone, fine grained intrusive igneous rock, or interbedded sandstone, siltstone and shale. These soils are on hills, escarpments, dip0slopes, structural benches and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Tolbert very cobbly loam, bouldery, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 18 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel and 30 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick) 

    Bt--18 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay films on faces of peds and bridging between sand grains; 15 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8). (13 to 38 cm thick) 

    R--30 cm; hard fine grained igneous rock.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Argirocker (SD) - formed in limestone; have limestone rock fragments
Bushvalley (AZ) formed in breccia, tuff, ash, or cinders; have extrusive igneous rock fragments

Tolman (WY) - formed in interbedded calcareous sandstone; include moderately alkaline reaction  
Zibetod (AZ) - have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - hills, escarpments, dip slopes, structural benches and mountains 
Elevation - 1,097 to 2,347 meters (2,682 m in Colorado)
Slope - 2 to 70 percent 
Parent material - colluvium or residuum derived from hard fine grained sandstone, fine grained intrusive igneous rock or interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers 
Mean annual precipitation - 381 to 584 mm 
Mean annual air temperature - 2.2 to 7.2 degrees C 
Frost-free period - 70 to 115 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blaincreek, Sawicki, and Shawmut soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, moderate to moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Tolbert soils are primarily used for rangeland, woodland, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is mainly Idaho fescue, rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, lupine, stoneseed, big sagebrush, and Rocky Mountain juniper. Areas in woodland have an overstory of Douglas-fir, limber pine, or ponderosa pine. Native vegetation in Colorado includes Letterman's needlegrass, Geyer's sedge, mountain brome, Gambel oak, snowberry and serviceberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tolbert soils are of moderate extent in southwestern Montana and western Colorado. MLRAs 43B, 44B, 46, and 48A.
