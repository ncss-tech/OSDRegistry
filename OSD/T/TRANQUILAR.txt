TRANQUILAR SERIES

The Tranquilar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine and alluvial deposits on nearly level to moderate slopes on valley floors and on adjacent terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  A similar soil is Jarola.  Jarola soils have mixed mineralogy and less than 60 percent clay in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tranquilar soils have formed in lacustrine and alluvial deposits on valley floors and on adjacent terrace positions.  The sediments were derived mainly from rhyolite, tuff, dacite, and latite.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 8,500 to 9,200 feet.  The climate is subhumid continental with a mean annual precipitation of about 20 to 25 inches. During spring and early summer there is a water table at 20 to 48 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 42 to 46 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cajete, Jarmillo, Jarola, and Hesperus series.  Cajete soils are formed in pumice and are ashy-skeletal.  Jarmillo soils lack an argillic horizon and are well drained.  Jarola soils are poorly drained, formed in alluvium and have a solum less than 35 inches thick.  Hesperus soils do not have albic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium runoff; slow or very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tranquilar soils are used mainly for grazing.  The native vegetation is Arizona fescue, bluegrass, pine dropseed, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral New Mexico; MLRA 48A.  Series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sandoval County, New Mexico, 1987.  Name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 8 inches.  This pedon is a mollisol because colors above and below the albic horizon meet the criteria (0 to 11 inches and 13 to 20 inches; A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons.)  

Albic horizon:  The zone from 11 to 13 inches.  (E horizons)

Argillic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 75 inches.  (Bt horizons)

The classification of this soil is changed from fine to very-fine based on NSSL lab data S 78-NM-43-11. The 12/2001 version changes the subgroup classification from Typic to Vertic.

Questions arose during the 12/2001 update of this description: The redox features in the E horizon suggest the depth to saturation may be shallower than stated. Additionally this series appears to include the poorly drained class. These characteristics were not revised, pending further mapping and study of this series.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The pedon was described and sampled as number S78-NM-43-11.  It is part of a characterization study in the Baca Location, Sandoval County.
