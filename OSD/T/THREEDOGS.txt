COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Whit series.  Whit soils have hue of 5YR, have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 30, and have calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 10 percent in the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Threedogs soils are on alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone and welded tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,646 to 1,722 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bigspring, Greatday, Kunzler, and Slaw soils.  Bigspring soils have mollic epipedons.  Greatday soils contain more than 50 percent strongly cemented nodules in the calcic horizon.  Kunzler soils contain less than 18 percent clay.  Slaw soils are fine-silty and do not have argillic horizons or calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Threedogs soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential vegetation is fourwing saltbush, black greasewood, basin wildrye, and alkali sacaton. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R028AY107NV, Saline Floodplain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 1,300 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  White Pine County, Nevada, East Part, 2004.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 30 to 89 cm (Btk1 and Btk2 horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone from 89 to 180 cm (Bk, Bkk1, and Bkk2 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 30 to 80 cm (Btk1 horizon and part of the Btk2 horizon).

The revision of June 2008 updated the taxonomic classification from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciargids based on laboratory data.

The argillic horizon was formed under previous, moister climatic conditions. It is engulfed in more recent airborne additions of calcium carbonate.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as pedon ID S05NV-017-006 (pedon # 05N0667).
