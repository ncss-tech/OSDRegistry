TUGGLE SERIES

The Tuggle series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from granite and other coarse grained igneous rocks. These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tuggle gravelly coarse sandy loam, very bouldery, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 20 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent pebbles; neutral
(pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    BC--11 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and few medium roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Cr--15 to 18 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    R--18 inches; hard granite bedrock.
