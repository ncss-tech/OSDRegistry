TELL SERIES

The Tell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying sandy deposits. These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys and on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota; MLRA SSO 10-10 (La Crosse, Wisconsin).

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Trempealeau County, Wisconsin, 1940.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 36 to 86 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 36 centimeters (Ap, E, and BE horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 86 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
udic moisture regime;
mesic temperature regime.

The type location was moved to Eau Claire County after the recorrelation of Crawford County, Wisconsin.  The former OSD Type Location in Crawford County is from a landscape and parent material that will no longer be a part of the Tell concept. The Tell series in the initial Crawford County soil survey has been re-correlated to three existing series. The current type location polygon and all polygons in this same landscape will be mapped as the Nuxmaruhanixete series, polygons mapped where the underlying material is outwash sand and gravel will be mapped as the Meridian series, and other polygons underlain by siliceous sand (no gravel) will be mapped as the Merit series. 

It is suspected that Tell may become an inactive series eventually as SSAs are re-correlated and series updated. The Nuxmaruhanixete series was established in nearby Richland County for a fine loamy Argiudoll and underlain by outwash parent material found on an older high strath terrace along the Wisconsin River which is unique to this part of the Driftless Area. The Merit series was established for a similar concept of a mollic intergrade, fine-loamy over ssk, and underlying siliceous sand. The Meridian series is an established series for a similar concept of a mollic intergrade, fine-loamy over ssk, and underlying outwash sand and gravel. It is unclear whether the Tell series concept will remain unique, mappable, and contrasting to these other concepts on these same landform positions where it is currently mapped. 

It is my belief that this concept and landscape position, where soils are moderately deep to siliceous sand or outwash, is better defined as being intergrade" alfisols to mollisols rather than typic" alfisols. These profiles tend to be droughty in dry years and fire undoubtedly played an important role in their pre-settlement history. Original vegetation maps indicate that savanna or open oak woods predominated. The more sloping areas tend to be eroded any may presently exhibit ochric epipedon colors but the predominant slopes are 1-6% and these typic profiles would be considered similar" soils.  T.Meyer.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
