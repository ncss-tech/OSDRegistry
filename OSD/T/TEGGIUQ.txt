COMPETING SERIES: This is the Tanacross series. Tanacross series have visible mica in the solum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: moderately deep or deep
Drainage class: poorly drained
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: mossy organic material over coarse-silty cryoturbate over permanently frozen coarse-silty eolian deposits
Slope: 3 to 25 percent
Annual precipitation: 15 to 26 inches, 393 to 657 mm
Annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F.,-2 to -1 C
Frost-free period: 95 to 135 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Kaviriuq, Nunaniq, and Sleetmute soils. Kaviriuq soils are podzolized and occur on convexities and at locally higher landscape positions, Nunaniq soils are well drained soils formed in loess at lower relative positions. Sleetmute soils are gravelly and occur on shoulders and noseslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained and high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the organic layers, moderately high in the solum and very low in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for Wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is Black spruce and moss.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 230, Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands Alaska. The series is of small extent.
