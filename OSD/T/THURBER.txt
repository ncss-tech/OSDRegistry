THURBER SERIES


The Thurber series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey slope alluvium derived from claystone of Pennsylvanian age. These soils occur on nearly level and very gently sloping toe slopes of ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

Leeray soils: have slickensides with vertic properties and occur on similar positions
Set soils: have a mollic epipedon and occur on higher escarpments and knolls

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is high on slopes less than 1 percent and very high on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland with a few areas farmed to small grain and sorghums. Native vegetation includes buffalograss, curlymesquite, vine-mesquite grass, and Texas wintergrass. Invader plants are mesquite, condalia, tasajillo, pricklypear, and ragweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Texas North Central Prairie (MLRA 80B), and West Cross Timbers (MLRA 84B) of Texas. The series is extensive.
