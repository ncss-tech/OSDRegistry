TUSKEEGO SERIES

The Tuskeego series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces and on base slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).
