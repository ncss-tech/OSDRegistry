TRAVONA SERIES 

The Travona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash influenced alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans and hills.  Slopes are 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, frigid Vitrandic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Travona ashy loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 9 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; few medium and common fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 23 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) ashy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; few medium and common fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk--23 to 41 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) ashy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few medium roots; common fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; common fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    BCk--41 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) ashy sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; disseminated lime; few fine masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: 

Elflint (MT) - moderately deep

Jarmills (NM) - does not have horizon of carbonate accumulation

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - alluvial fans and hills.
Elevation - 5,100 to 6,100 feet.
Slope - 1 to 12 percent.
Parent material - volcanic ash influenced alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 12 to 16 inches.
Mean annual air temperature - 40 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Chinasprings series. Chinasprings soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Travona soils are primarily used for rangeland. Potential native vegetation is chiefly mixed grasses, such as bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue and Idaho fescue with some areas of widely scattered Douglas fir. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Travona soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.
