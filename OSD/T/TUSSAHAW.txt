TYPICAL PEDON: Tussahaw channery sandy loam on a northeast facing, 20 percent slope in mixed hardwood forest. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise indicated.)

 A--0 to 3 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) channery sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and few medium roots; 18 percent fragments of sillimanite schist channers; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

 Bt1--3 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very channery sandy clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few fine flakes of mica; 35 percent fragments of sillimanite schist channers; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bt2--9 to 20 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) very channery sandy clay loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few fine flakes of mica; 50 percent fragments of sillimanite schist channers; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

 C--20 to 27 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) very channery sandy clay loam; massive; friable; few fine flakes of mica; 60 percent fragments of sillimanite schist channers; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Cr--27 to 41 inches; weathered sillimanite schist, multicolored in shades of red and brown.

 R--41 inches; hard, fractured sillimanite schist

TYPE LOCATION: Butts County, Georgia; 800 feet west of bridge at Georgia highway 16 and Ocmulgee River to Stark Road; 1600 feet to water plant; 1600 feet northeast along water plant access road to road cut. (USGS Lloyd Shoals Dam topographic quadrangle (1964), Latitude 33 degrees 18 minutes 44 seconds N., Longitude 83 degrees 50 minutes 20 seconds W.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the Base of the Argillic: 20 to 40 inches
Depth to Bedrock: 20 to 40 to soft bedrock and greater than 40 to hard bedrock
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: Greater than 72 inches
Content and size of rock fragments: 15 to 70 percent, by volume, in the A and 35 to 70 percent in the B and C horizons; mostly gravel, channers, cobbles, and stones from sillimanite schist, mica schist, or quartz mica gneiss
Soil Reaction: Very strongly to strongly acid, except where limed
Other Features: Most pedons have few to common flakes of mica

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

A horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. A horizons with moist value of 3 or less are less than 7 inches thick.
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy loam

E horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy loam

BA horizon or BE horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy loam or loam

Bt horizon:
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam

C horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)--sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam

Cr horizon:
Type of bedrock--multicolored, weathered sillimanite schist with occasional interbeds of mica schist and quartz mica gneiss. Soil material often extends downward into nearly vertical cracks in this horizon.

R horizon:
Type of bedrock--unweathered fractured sillimanite schist, mica schist, or quartz mica gneiss

COMPETING SERIES: Cliffside and Lockhart soils are in a similar family. Cliffside soils have a lithic contact above 40 inches. Lockhart soils formed in material mostly weathered from porphyritic granite, have sola 40 to 60 inches thick and are very deep to a lithic contact.

Parent Material: High-grade metamorphic rock residuum
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 61 degrees
Mean Annual Precipitation: 48 to 55 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Bethlehem soils have a fine particle-size control section with kaolinitic clay mineralogy and are on similar landforms
Pacolet soils have a fine particle-size control section with kaolinitic clay mineralogy, lack a Cr or R and are on similar landforms
Towaliga soils have a fine particle-size control section with kaolinitic clay mineralogy and have a lithologic discontinuity and are on similar landforms
