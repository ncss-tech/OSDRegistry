TOINETTE SERIES

The Toinette series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy fluvial and marine sediments. These nearly level to very strongly sloping soils are on hills of the Southern Coastal Plains MLRA 133A. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1626 mm (64 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic Arenic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Toinette loamy sand, on a complex 12 percent slope of recently planted longleaf pine at an elevation of about 40 meters (130 feet). (Colors are for moist soil). 

 Ap -- 0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy sand; single grain; loose; common very fine and fine roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches) thick]

 E -- 10 to 79 centimeters (4 to 31 inches); yellow (10YR 7/6) loamy sand; single grain; loose; few fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [43 to 91 centimeters (17 to 36 inches) thick]

 BE -- 79 to 97 centimeters (31 to 38 inches); 70 percent yellowish red (5YR 5/6) and 30 percent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) thick)]

[25 to 56 centimeters (10 to 22 inches) thick]

 BC -- 130 to 147 centimeters (51 to 58 inches); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine and coarse roots; some sand grains are coated and bridged with clay; few medium distinct very pale brown (10YR 7/4) pockets of stripped sand; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. [0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) thick]

 C -- 147 to 203 centimeters (58 to 80 inches); 60 percent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and 40 percent yellow (10YR 7/6) loamy sand; single grain; loose; common medium distinct very pale brown (10YR 7/4) and few medium prominent white (10YR 8/1) pockets of stripped sand; very strongly acid.
