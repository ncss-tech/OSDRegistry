TWOJAYAY SERIES

The Twojayay series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Twojayay soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Twojayay soils are on stream terraces. They typically occur on summit positions. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eastwalker, Goodbye and Patididit series.  Eastwalker and Goodbye soils have a mollic epipedon. Patididit soils lack secondary carbonates within 20 cm of the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 75 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between January and June. Cumulative annual duration class is common. These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year round.

USE AND VEGETATION: Twojayay soils are used for pastureland, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly rushes. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
