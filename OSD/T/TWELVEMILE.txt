The 15 bar water on air-dried samples is 5 to 8 percent for the profile.  Phosphorous retention is assumed to be greater than 25 percent and the Al-Ox plus Fe-Ox is assumed to be greater than 0.4 percent.

9/19/2023 - This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note-Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). Most of the changes were in formatting. Also added ashy modifiers and volcanic ash parent materials, added ashy loamy sand textures to the RIC, expanded ranges of elevation, precipitation, and temperature, and updated competing series section (see trip report from May 2015 field review from OR683 Soil Survey Area Project)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
