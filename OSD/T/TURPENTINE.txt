TURPENTINE SERIES

The Turpentine series consists of deep to very deep, well-drained soils on planar to concave stable backslopes and benches of mountains. Turpentine soils formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium from noncalcareous sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, frigid Alfic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON: Turpentine ashy silt loam - woodland, on a 34 percent, planar, south-facing slope at an elevation of 5,070 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  Soil textures are apparent field textures.)
