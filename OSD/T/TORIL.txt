TORIL SERIES

The Toril series consists of well drained soils which are shallow and very shallow to limestone bedrock and formed primarily in residuum weathered from limestone of Cretaceous age. Toril soils are on plateau margins with slopes of 1 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual soil temperature is 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Toril channery sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

     A--0 to 4 centimeters (0.0 to 1.6 inches); brown (10YR 5/3), dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; channery sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common medium and few fine and very fine roots; common very fine tubular and few very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent angular limestone channers; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

     Bk1--4 to 19 centimeters (1.6 to 7.5 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/3), very dark grayish brown (7.5YR 3/2), moist; channery loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine  and few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular and common very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent angular limestone channers; violently effervescent, calcium carbonate segregated into very fine, irregular soft masses and very fine, irregular nodules; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

     Bk2--19 to 34 centimeters (7.5 to 13.4 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/3), very dark grayish brown (7.5YR 3/2), moist;  very channery loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine  and few fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular  pores; 35 percent angular limestone channers; violently effervescent, calcium carbonate segregated into very fine and fine, irregular soft masses; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

     R--34 centimeters (13.4 inches); common medium and fine roots along top of bedrock contact; strongly cemented limestone.

TYPE LOCATION: Mora County, New Mexico, west of headquarters for Fort Union Ranch; DD: 35.8487, -105.0102; Elevation 6660' (2113 m).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 10 to 50 cm (4 to 20 inches). The mollic epipedon typically extends throughout the solum; where it does not, its thickness is at least 18 cm (7 inches). Rock fragments in the control section range from 15 to 35 percent, and typically include channers, gravels, and flags. Subsurface horizons are strongly to violently effervescent and moderately alkaline throughout, and the surface is most often calcareous. The Toril series is in a mesic soil temperature regime and an aridic-ustic soil moisture regime, most of which falls during the summer monsoon season from May to August.

A horizon: 
Hue of 10YR or 2.5Y
Value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma of 1 to 3 
Texture of fine earth fraction: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam
Fragments: 15 to 30 percent limestone channers and/or gravels, 0 to 10 percent limestone flags
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 35 percent

Bk1 horizon: 
Hue of 10YR or 2.5Y
Value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma of 1 to 3 
Texture of fine earth fraction: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam
Fragments: 15 to 25 percent limestone channers and/or gravels, 0 to 15 percent limestone flags
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 40 percent

Bk2 horizon: 
Hue of 10YR or 2.5Y
Value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma of 2 to 4 
Texture of fine earth fraction: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam
Fragments: 15 to 25 percent limestone channers and/or gravels, 0 to 15 percent limestone flags
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 40 percent

R horizon: Strongly cemented or indurated limestone bedrock. Fracture interval is greater than 10 cm (4 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Purner (MLRA 38), Santana (MLRA 70C), and Venzia (MLRAs 38 and 35) series. 

Purner soils contain a cemented subsoil layer.
Santana soils contain felsic rock fragments and lack Bk horizons.
Venzia soils contain basalt fragments and lack Bk horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toril soils are found on plateau interfluves of the Canadian Plateaus LRU of MLRA 70A. They formed mostly in limestone and shale residuum of the Cretaceous Greenhorn Formation with eolian materials are evident in some topsoils. They occur on positions where erosion has caused lithic limestone to be close to the surface, usually within 50cm depth.

Slope range: 0 to 25 percent
Soil moisture: ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic
Mean annual soil temperature: 9.4 to 14.4 degrees C (49 to 58 degrees F) 
Mean annual air temperature: 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation: 381 to 457 mm (15 to 18 in) with more than 3/4 received during the period of April through September
Frost-free period: 130 to 175 days 
Elevation: 1690 to 2225 m (5550 to 7300 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Litle, Mion, and Colmor soils of MLRA 70A. Litle and Mion soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section, lack mollic epipedons, and are underlain by paralithic shale. Colmor soils are very deep and fine-silty. Depending on the history of disturbance, tree cover ranges from 0 to roughly 30 percent.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; local runoff class ranges from low in nearly level soils to very high where slopes exceed 10 percent; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are primarily used as native rangeland. Principal native plants are New Mexico feathergrass, sideoats grama, blue grama, little bluestem, twoneedle pion, and oneseed juniper. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern New Mexico, LRR G, in MLRA 70A along the Canadian Plateaus of the Southwestern Great Plains; LRU 70A.1 (Canadian Plateaus). The series is moderately extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Mora County, New Mexico, 2021. 

REMARKS:
This soil was previously correlated to the Penrose series. The Penrose series was established in MLRAs 67 and 69 in areas with an ustic-aridic soil moisture regime. The name Toril is taken from the locality of Toril, near Springer, NM, and means "bullpen" in Spanish. 

Mollic epipedon described from 0 to 34 cm
Lithic contact identified at 34 cm
