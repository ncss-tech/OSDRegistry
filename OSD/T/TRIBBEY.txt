TRIBBEY SERIES

The Tribbey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of recent age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on narrow flood plains in river valleys in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 889 mm (35 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, thermic Oxyaquic Udifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Tribbey fine sandy loam -- improved pasture, at an elevation of 335 m (1100 ft). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) fine sandy loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable; few faint stratifications; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 36 cm [4 to 14 inches])

  C1--25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inches); red (2.5YR 4/6) crushed, strata of fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and fine sand; massive; slightly hard, very friable; saturated with water at 76 cm (30 inches); moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

  C2--102 to 127 cm (40 to 50 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) crushed, strata of fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand and fine sand; massive; slightly hard, very friable; saturated with water; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the C horizon is 66 to 152 cm [26 to 60 in])

  Ab--127 to 165 cm (50 to 65 in); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; saturated with water; common fine distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) masses of iron accumulation with clear boundaries; common fine distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions with __ boundaries; slight effervescent; moderately alkaline.  

TYPE LOCATION: Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma; about 5 miles west and 1 mile south of Bethel; 1,400 feet south and 200 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 33, T. 10 N., R. 2 E.

Pulaski soils: are well drained and occur on slight rises 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:

Permeability: moderate
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:  moderate 
Runoff: high 
Endosaturation: this soil is saturated with water in all layers to a depth of 203 cm (80 in) or more, for 20 or more consecutive days, or 30 or more cumulative days in normal years

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for improved pasture and rangeland. Native vegetation consists of willow trees with an understory of tall grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Oklahoma; LRR H; North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A); moderately extensive.

REMARKS: 
These soils were formerly included in the Pulaski series.  Extensive revisions to the OSD as a result of the SDJR Initiative (JLD 03/2016.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) (A horizon)
Oxyaquic Udifluvents features: soils with an udic moisture regime that have an apparent water (endosaturation) table within 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) of the soil surface
Buried horizon: 127 to 165 cm (50 to 65 in) (Ab horizon)
