THARPSLOG SERIES

The Tharpslog series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from granite. The Tharpslog soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1050 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Humixerepts

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Azalea, Cabincove, and Generalgrant soils. The Azalea soils are on convex shoulders and backslopes of mountain slopes and have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. The Cabincove soils are on linear to convex backslopes of mountain slopes and have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. The Generalgrant soils are on concave footslopes of stream terraces and drainageways on mountain slopes and are moderately well drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tharpslog soils are on linear to concave backslopes of mountain slopes. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium over residuum derived from granite. Elevation is 1215 to 2600 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 800 to 1170 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free season is 105 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Azalea, Canyonview, and Tinybaugh soils. The competing Azalea soils are on convex shoulders and backslopes of mountain slopes and have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. The Canyonview soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes and are sandy-skeletal. The Tinybaugh soils are on linear to convex structural benches and mountain slopes and have a lithic contact between 25 and 50 cm.
