TAYLOR SERIES 

The Taylor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, smectitic, frigid Aquertic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Taylor silty clay - on a 4 percent convex slope in a cultivated field. When described the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A--0 to 4 inchs; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; strong medium granular structure; friable; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick) 

    E--4 to 10 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; strong medium platy structure; friable; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

    B/E--10 to 14 inches; 60 percent brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay (Bt) and 40 percent gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam (E); strong medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrationss; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bt--14 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay; strong medium angular blocky structure; firm; few discontinuous dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay films on faces of peds; few fine faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) Fe depletions; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 30 inches thick) 

    BC--30 to 38 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay; moderate fine angular blocky structure; firm; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 12 inches thick)

    C1--38 to 60 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay; massive; firm; common white (10YR 8/1) soft masses of carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

    C2--60 to 80 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) clay; massive; firm; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) Fe concentrations and common medium faint dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) Fe depletions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: St. Louis County, Minnesota, about 8 miles southwest of Cook; 1200 feet south and 2400 feet east of the northwest corner section 20, T. 61 N., R. 19 W.; USGS Linden Grove Quadrangle, latitude 47 degrees 45 minutes 28 seconds N; longitude 92 degrees 47 minutes 37 seconds W.; NAD27. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 15 to 40 inches. The soil has no rock fragments.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy fine sand. It is strongly acid to neutral. 

The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand. It is strongly acid to neutral. 

The B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to Bt and E horizons respectively.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. In pedons having matrix chroma greater than 2 there are Fe depletions or subhorizons having chroma of 2 or less within the upper 10 inches. It is clay. It ranges from strongly acid to neutral, but the lower part may be slightly alkaline. Clay content ranges from 60 to 80 percent. 

The BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay or silty clay. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.

The C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay or silty clay, but in some pedons it has thin coarser textured varves. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. 

A sandy substratum phase is recognized where a 2C horizon is present below 60 inches. It has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is fine sand, sand, coarse sand, gravelly sand or gravelly coarse sand. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume, with 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 5 to 35 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Taylor soils are on plane or convex surfaces of glacial lake plains. The slope gradient commonly is 0 to 8 percent, but ranges as high as 45 percent on sideslopes of drainageways. The soils formed in clayey calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits. The mean annual air temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 21 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 88 to 135 days. Elevation is about 1000 to 1600 feet above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alango (T), Baudette, Dalbo, Indus, Spooner, Wildwood and Woodslake soils. The somewhat poorly Alango, poorly drained Indus and the very poorly drained Wildwood or Woodslake soils are in a hydrosequence with Taylor soils. Dalbo soils are on similar topographic positions as Taylor soils but are fine. The moderately well drained Baudette soils and the poorly drained Spooner soils are developed in lacustrine silts and are closely associated with Taylor soils in a few places. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow. Perched saturation is at a depth of 1.0 to 3.0 feet at some time during April through June and October through November in noraml years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Taylor soils are forested. Dominant species are aspen, pine, and white spruce. A few areas are used for forage and small grains. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs-57,88,90.  Northern Minnesota, Moderately extensive.
