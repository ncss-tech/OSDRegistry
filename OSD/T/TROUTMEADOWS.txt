TROUTMEADOWS SERIES

The Troutmeadows series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridges and upper side slopes of mountains.  Troutmeadows soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying colluvium and residuum from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Troutmeadows soils are on ridges and upper side slopes of mountains.  Elevations are 5,400 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The soil is formed in volcanic ash overlying residuum and colluvium derived from basalt.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 25 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crawfish and competing Mountemily series.  Crawfish soils are 4 to 10 inches deep to bedrock and are on side slopes and shoulders of mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, watershed, recreation and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, grand fir, western larch, Engleman spruce, grouse huckleberry, yarrow, violets, strawberry, white hawkweed, elk sedge and pine grass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon, MLRA 43.  The soils are of small extent.
