TRICOUNI SERIES

The Tricouni series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and glacial drift over glacial drift on terraces, debris cones, and valley walls.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dougan, Fernwood, Hoffstadt, Sarazan, and Zygore series.  The Dougan and Fernwood soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Hoffstadt and Sarazan soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Textures in the Dougan, Fernwood, Sarazan, and Zygore soils range from loam to silt loam or have medial modifiers in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  The Hoffstadt soils are formed in colluvium or residuum from basic igneous rocks.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tricouni soils are on terraces, debris cones, and valley walls at elevations of 300 to 1,200 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with glacial drift, over glacial drift.  The climate is mild; with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,500 to 2,500 millimeters and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Easy, Nohokomeen, and Thorton series.  Easy and Thorton soils have an ashy over loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Easy soils also meet criteria for albic and spodic materials in the upper portion of the soil profile.  Nohokomeen soils have a seasonal high water table within 50 centimeters of the soil surface and generally occur in the lower portions of the landscape.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained soils, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and western red cedar with an understory including Oregon-grape, vine maple, bunchberry, queen's cup beadlily, prince's pine, red huckleberry, twin flower, and pachistima.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of moderate extent.
