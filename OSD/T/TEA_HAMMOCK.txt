COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Sandy anthropogenic dredgic deposits over fluviomarine deposits
Landscape--Coastal lagoons
Landform--Dredge-deposit shoals
Slope--0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation--970 to 1570 millimeters (38 to 62 inches)
Mean annual air temperature--20 to 25 degrees C (69 to 77 degrees F)
Water salinity range--18 to 29 parts per thousand
Frost-free period--365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Broadaxe, Buttonwood, Endeavor, Ittsanapper, Mullet, and Sandfly soils.
Broadaxe soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms and are much sandier throughout.
Buttonwood soils--are on barrier cove landforms, developed in lagoonal deposits and often have thick humilluvic materials.
Endeavor soils--are on relict flood-tidal delta sand flats and slopes, have sandier textures, and were created through natural lagoon processes.
Ittsanapper soils--are on lagoon bottom landforms, at deeper water depths, and have thicker finer textured materials throughout.
Mullet soils--are on washover-fan flats and have sandy textures throughout
Sandfly soils--are on estuarine tidal streams often near dredge channels but do not have anthropogenic dredge spoil deposits.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish harvesting; benthic species include tubeworms, clams, crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish 
Native vegetation--Dominant vegetation is driven by water quality and quantity within subaqueous systems. In most areas, the natural vegetation has been removed and the existing vegetation consists of seagrass species under good to excellent water quality conditions or rooted eukaryotic macroalgae in the green (Chlorophyta), red (Rhodophyta), and brown (Phaeophyta) algae families under degraded or poor water quality conditions.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the coasts of Indian River Lagoon, Florida
Land Resource Regions--U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop, and Range Region
MLRA(s)--155
Extent--Small
