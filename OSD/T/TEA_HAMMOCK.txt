TYPE LOCATION: Brevard County, Florida; approximately 1.39 miles northwest of the intersections of Route 401 and Grouper Road on north side of Port Canaveral and approximately 1.58 miles due north of Route A1A on a dredge spoil island; USGS topographic quadrangle: Courtenay, Florida.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Coarse-loamy anthropogenic dredgic deposits over fluviomarine deposits
Landscape--Coastal lagoons
Landform--Dredge-deposit shoals
Slope--0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation--970 to 1570 millimeters (38 to 62 inches)
Mean annual air temperature--20 to 25 degrees C (69 to 77 degrees F)
Water salinity range--18 to 29 parts per thousand
Frost-free period--365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Broadaxe, Buttonwood, Endeavor, Ittsanapper, Mullet, and Sandfly soils.
Broadaxe soils--are on submerged wave-cut platforms and are much sandier throughout.
Buttonwood soils--are on barrier cove landforms, developed in lagoonal deposits and often have thick humilluvic materials.
Endeavor soils--are on relict flood-tidal delta sand flats and slopes, have sandier textures, and were created through natural lagoon processes.
Ittsanapper soils--are on lagoon bottom landforms, at deeper water depths, and have thicker finer textured materials throughout.
Mullet soils--are on washover-fan flats and have sandy textures throughout
Sandfly soils--are on estuarine tidal streams often near dredge channels but do not have anthropogenic dredge spoil deposits.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by saline and brackish water.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--Used for recreational boating, fishing, and swimming, marinas, mooring fields, and commercial shellfish harvesting; benthic species include tubeworms, clams, crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish 
Native vegetation--Rooted and floating algae (Dasya), seaweed (Caulerpa) which usually indicates degraded / poor water quality; vegetative seaweed cover ranges from 0 through 20 percent

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the coasts of Indian River Lagoon, Florida
Land Resource Regions--U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop, and Range Region
MLRA(s)--155
Extent--Small
