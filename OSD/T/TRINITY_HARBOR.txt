Total soil organic carbon stock 0 to 200 centimeters--5 to 25 kg m-2

Aseg or ACseg horizons (where present):

Cseg or CAseg horizons:
Hue--5Y to 5GY, or Neutral
Value--3 to 5
Chroma--0 to 3
Texture--Sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or their shelly or very shelly analogs
Organic carbon density--0.2 to 27 kg m-3

COMPETING SERIES:
There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape--Barrier island lagoons
Landform--High-energy lagoon bottoms
Parent material--Coarse-loamy lagoonal deposits
Slope--0 to 1 percent
Water depth range--1 to 3 meters (3 to 10 feet) below mean sea level
Water salinity range--0.5 to 5 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Kill Devil, Kitty Hawk, and Pine Island soils.
Kill Devil soils--are on lower energy areas of the landform and have a fine-loamy particle size class.
Kitty Hawk soils--are on washover-fans and contain hypersulfidic materials.
Pine Island soils--are on relict flood-tidal deltas and formed in sandy lagoonal deposits.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--Moderately high to high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is continuously inundated by brackish water. The water level is primarily driven by wind tides.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses--The area is used for recreational fishing, swimming, hunting, and boating. Uses also include commercial fishing and crabbing.
Typical vegetation--Vegetation is less abundant as Trinity Harbor soils occur in deeper water where sunlight is scarce. Where water depths are shallower, widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata), and Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) may be present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area--Coastal plain estuaries in North Carolina and Virgina
Land Resource Regions--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
MLRA(s)--153B
Extent--Small  

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Region

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Currituck County, North Carolina, 2026

REMARKS:
The series is named after the Trinity Harbor inlet, which was open in the 16th and 17th centuries. It appears on historic maps, including the White and De Bry map of 1590. Trinity Harbor soils were previously mapped as water in North Carolina and Virginia soil surveys.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022):
Hyposulfidic materials--The zone from 0 to 38 centimeters has an initial pH that decreases by 1 or more units but remains at a value of 4.0 or more after 16 weeks of moist aerobic incubation.
Fluidity--The zone from 38 to 109 centimeters has a fluidity class of moderately fluid.
Peraquic feature--Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface (permanently submerged).
