TELA SERIES

The Tela Series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These nearly level, occasionally flooded soils occur along drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Aridic Argiustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Tela sandy clay loam, on an east facing, linear, about 0.5 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 154.0 meters (505 feet).
     (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Salco series in the same family. Similar soils are the Alet, , Colmena, Czar, Escobas, Pernitas, Ramadero, Runge, and Weesatche series. 
Salco soils: occur on higher upland positions that do not flood
Alet, Colmena, Czar, Pernitas, Runge, and Weesatche soils: have a typic-ustic soil moisture regime.
Escobas soils: have less than 18 percent clay content in the particle-size control section
Ramadero soils: have a mollic epipedon more than 50 cm (20 in) thick.
Pernitas, Runge, and Weesatche soils: have a calcic horizon and Pernitas soils are calcareous throughout.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loamy alluvium.
Landform: drainageways 
Slope: 0 to 2 percent.
Precipitation pattern: June to August and December to February are the driest months, while September to November and March to May are the wettest months.
Mean annual precipitation: 457 to 635 mm (18 to 25 in).
Thornthwaite P-E index: 20 to 32.
Mean annual temperature: 21.1 to 22.8 degrees C (70 to 73 degrees F).
Frost-free period: 270 to 340 days.
Elevation: 54.9 to 289.6 m (180 to 950 ft).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Brennan, Copita, Delmita, and Tiocano soils. 
Brennan soils: do not have a mollic epipedon and occur on higher positions. 
Copita soils: are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) deep to bedrock, are calcareous throughout, do not have argillic horizons, and occur on higher positions. 
Delmita soils: are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) to a petrocalcic horizon and occur on higher positions
Tiocano soils: are in depressions and have intersecting slickensides. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible. The soils are occasionally flooded when they receive runoff water from tropical storms once in 10 to 20 years of low velocity and short duration.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. A few areas are used for crop production of grain sorghum. Native vegetation is mostly a thick overstory of mesquite, whitebrush, huisache, a ground cover of trichloris, lovegrass tridens, plains bristlegrass, and hooded windmillgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Rio Grande Plain, Texas; LRR I; MLRA 83B; moderate extent.
