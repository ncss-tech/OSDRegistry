TAHQUATS SERIES

Typically, Tahquats soils have dark grayish brown A1 horizons, brown or light brown moderately fine textured B2t horizons containing more than 35 percent of coarse fragments, and noncalcareous loamy C horizons containing many coarse fragments.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tahquats stony loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 7 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic, many very fine and fine and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; very few uncoated silt and sand particles; about 3 percent stones and 15 percent angular gravel, mostly dark gray (10YR 4/1) quartzite; medium acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    A3--7 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly heavy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky, parting to weak fine granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine, few coarse roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few uncoated silt particles; about 25 percent stones, cobbles, and gravel; medium acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    B21t--12 to 27 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly light clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common fine, few medium and coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; thin patchy darker clay films on faces of peds and medium continuous ones in some pores; common uncoated silt particles; about 15 percent stones and cobbles and 20 percent subangular quartzite gravel; medium acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary.  (d10 to 20 inches thick)

    B22t--27 to 34 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very gravelly light clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, plastic; slightly sticky; few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular pores; thin patchy clay films on peds and medium nearly continuous ones in some channels; very few uncoated silt and sand particles; about 35 percent white (10YR 8/1) and pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) subangular and subrounded quartzite fragments, which are stained reddish yellow (10YR 6/6) inward 0.5 inch; medium acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

    B3t--34 to 44 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky, plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; thin patchy clay films on peds and in pores; few fine spots of light gray (10YR 7.2) uncoated silt and sand particles; about 50 percent stones, cobbles, and gravel, mostly pinkish gray quartzite; medium acid (pH 5.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

    C--44 to 58 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable; few fine roots; common very fine pores; about 50 percent of coarse fragments, mostly quartzite; common fine iron-manganese oxide concretions; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Caribou County, Idaho; Bear Canyon Area; d12 percent northerly slope at 6,300 feet elevation; NE 1/4 of section 30, T.5S., R.38E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature is 35 to 43 degrees F., and the average summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist when not frozen.  The profile is noncalcareous to 60 inches or deeper.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick.  The A1 horizon to a depth of 7 inches or more has value of 3.5 to 4.5 dry and j1.5 to 2.5 moist, and chroma of 1.5 to 2.5.  It has weak platy to strong granular structure and is medium acid to neutral (pH 6.0 to 7.0).  Its organic matter has a C:N ratio of less than 13.5.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 6.5 dry and 3.5 to 4.5 moist, and chroma of 2.5 through 4.   It is light clay loam to silty clay loam containing 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  This horizon has moderate to weak, very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid (pH 5.5 to 6.1).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blaine, Buena Vista, Ess, Hoddle, Libeg, Nathrop, Thiel, and Woodhall series.  Blaine, Buena Vista, Hoodle, and Nathrop soils have Cca horizons, also Buena Vista and Nathrop soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Ess soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the B2t horizon, and lack common uncoated silt particles in the upper part of the B2t horizon.  Libeg soils have mollic epipedons thinner than 8 inches.  Thiel soils have mildly alkaline B2t horizons and have a Cca horizon.  Woodhall soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tahquats soils are on alluvial fans and footslopes at elevation of 5,500 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes range form 2 to 20 percent.   The alluvium and colluvium are derived mostly from quartzite and some sandstone materials.  The climate is continental subhumid and has an average annual precipitation of 15 to 25 inches, including 5 to 10 feet of snowfall, and an average freeze-free period of 30 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Nagitsy and Nielsen soils.  Nagitsy soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches and lack an argillic horizon.  Nielsen soils are shallow to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.  These soils may receive some runoff from adjacent hills.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mostly for summer grazing.  The natural vegetation is wyethia, Idaho fescue, bluegrass, junegrass, brome grass, sedge, wheatgrass, yarrow, tragapogon, aster, geranium, and scattered snowberry and big sagebrush

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous parts of southeastern Idaho.  About 4,300 acres have been mapped.  The series probably is moderately extensive.
