TICKVILLE SERIES

The Tickville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from andesite.  Tickville soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tickville extremely cobbly loam, on an east facing, linear to convex, 53 percent slope in Gambel oak at an elevation of 6156 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered by 10 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones of andesite origin and subangular in shape.

    A1--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; many very fine, common fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary.  

    A2--4 to 11 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine granular; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine, few fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (total thickness of A horizons - 10 to 15 inches thick)

    Bt--11 to 29 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely stony silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common discontinuous prominent clay skins on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 30 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 36 inches thick)

    R--29 inches; fractured andesite bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birchcreek (ID), Derringer (OR), Droem T (ID), Erakatak (NV), Leevan (NV), McIvey (NV), Ravenswood (NV), Roostercomb (OR), Sharesnout (ID), Threek (ID), Yago (ID), and Yeates Hollow (UT) series.

Birchcreek, Droem, Leevan, Ravenswood, Sharesnout, Threek:  have xeric bordering on aridic moisture regimes.

Derringer, Erakatak:  are moderately deep to paralithic material.

McIvey, Threek, Yago:  are very deep

Roostercomb: have xeric bordering on aridic moisture regimes and formed in greenstone

Yeates Hollow:  is greater than 40 inches to quartzite bedrock

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tickville soils.

Parent material:  colluvium over residuum derived from andesite.

Landform:  volcanic affected mountain slopes.

Slopes:  8 to 60 percent

Elevation: 4,800 to 6,800 feet

Mean annual air temperature:  41 to 45 degrees F.

Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches.

  Wettest months:  October to May.

  Driest months:  June to September.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beefhollow, Jesh, Melling, and Reywat series.  

Beefhollow and Jesh: are very deep and typically are in more concave hillslope positions.  

Melling and Reywat: are shallow and are under sagebrush.   

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high and very high runoff, slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Wildlife habitat and rangeland.  Some potential native plants are Gambel oak, mountain snowberry, bluebunch wheatgrass, and mountain brome.  In Utah, the Tickville series is correlated with Mountain Gravelly Loam (Oak) - 047AY410UT ecological sites.
