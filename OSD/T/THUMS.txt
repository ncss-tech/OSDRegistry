THUMS SERIES


The Thums series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in uplifted alluvium from mixed rock sources and have a thin mantle of human transported material at the surface. Thums soils are on terraces and fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 331 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic Epipedon - the zone from a depth of 0 to 95 cm
Human-transported materials - the zone from a depth of 0 to 26 cm
Artifacts - the zone from a depth of 6 to 26 cm
Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 26 to 170 cm
Secondary Carbonates - the zone from a depth of 6 to 115 cm
Particle size control section - the zone from a depth of 26 to 76 cm

Human-transported materials at the surface are not a series requirement, are typically less than 50 cm thick and do not significantly impact interpretations. Soils with natural soil at the surface are included in this concept.

The argillic horizon can sometimes begin directly under HTM with or without a contrasting particle size.
