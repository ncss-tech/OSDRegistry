TOONE SERIES

The Toone series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered mainly from diorite and conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite. These soils are on mountain slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic Pachic Palecryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Toone loam, rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; matted leaves and stems.

    A1--5 to 23 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) heavy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dry; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 33 cm thick)

    A2--23 to 41 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) heavy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) dry; weak coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (18 to 33 cm thick)

    A3--41 to 74 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) heavy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; 15 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual irregular boundary. (0 to 36 cm thick)

    Bt1--74 to 99 cm; dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) very cobbly heavy clay loam, weak red (2.5YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; common thin clay skins on faces of peds; 30 percent cobbles and 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--99 to 157 cm; dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) gravelly clay loam, weak red (2.5YR 4/2) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; common thin clay skins on faces of peds; 20 percent gravel and 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4).
