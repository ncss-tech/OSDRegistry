TIPPIPAH SERIES

The Tippipah series consists very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from ignimbrite and basalt. Tippipah soils are on alluvial fans and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tippipah soils are on smooth or slightly convex, nearly level alluvial fans with slope gradient of 0 to 2 percent.  Tippipah soils developed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from ignimbrite and basalt. These soils occur at an elevation of 1,520 to 1,590 meters in a cool, semi-arid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fang and Papoose soils. Fang soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Papoose soils have sandy clay loam or sandy loam argillic horizons and lack silica cementation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, but could be cultivated to climatically adapted crops if irrigation water were available. At a typical site about 4 to 6 percent of the soil surface is covered by vegetation. The dominant vegetation consists of shadscale, bud sagebrush, winterfat and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada, the soil is inextensive. MLRA 29.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County, Nevada, Pahranagat and Penoyer Valleys, 1965. Tippipah is the name of a local spring.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly classified as Desert soils.
