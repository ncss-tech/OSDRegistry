TOKIO SERIES

The Tokio series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in recent sandy eolian deposits over calcareous, loamy lacustrine deposits from the Tahoka Formation of Pleistocene age. Tokio soils are on nearly level and very gently sloping eolian plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 millimeters (19 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).

Gomez, Hindman, Lenorah, and Seagraves series and also the Arvana, Lamesa, Midessa, Patricia, and Posey series.
Amarillo, Brownfield, and Gomez soils are on higher landscape positions.
Arvana soils are on higher landscape positions and have a petrocalcic horizon.
Hindman and Lenorah soils are on similar landscape positions.
Lamesa soils are on lower landscape positions and have aquic moisture conditions.
Midessa soils are on slightly higher landscape positions, have calcareous horizons above the calcic horizon, and do not have an argillic horizon.

Posey soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have calcareous horizons above the calcic horizon.
Seagraves soils are on lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Moderate permeability. Surface runoff 
is negligible on 0 to 1 percent and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for cropland but also used as native rangeland and wildlife habitat. Principal crops grown are cotton and grain sorghum. Climax vegetation is tall and mid grasses, with tall grasses tending to dominate. This 
site is dominated by little and sand bluestem along with taller dropseed 
species. The remainder is mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, sand 
dropseed, hooded windmillgrass, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, 
hairy grama, needle and thread, and perennial threeawn. Sand sage, shin-oak, and 
skunkbush are also present. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy 
(R077CY035TX) and Sandy Loam (R077CY036TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains of western Texas and potentially, 
eastern New Mexico (sub-MLRA-77C). The series is of moderate extent.
