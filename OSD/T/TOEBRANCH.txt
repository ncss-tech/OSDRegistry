TOEBRANCH SERIES

The Toebranch series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Toebranch loam, cropland - on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 6,200 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 8 inches thick)

    BA--6 to 16 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    Bw1--16 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on faces of peds; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

    Bw2--25 to 36 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (7 to 12 inches thick)

    BC--36 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Echocreek, Koosharem, Oakspring, Roschene, Toehead and Zola series. The Echocreek, Oakspring, Toehead and Zola soils have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  The Koosharem soils do not have Bw horizons.  The Roschene soils are moderately well drained and have redox features at 30 to 60 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform: stream terraces
Elevation: 6,100 to 6,300 feet
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Parent material: mixed alluvium
Climate: long, cool winters; moist springs; dry, warm summers.   
Average annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches
Average annual temperature: 40 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Thatcher and Thomasfork soils.  Thatcher soils are fine-silty and have an argillic horizon on more convex positions on stream terraces.   Thomasfork soils are fine family on lower stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for cropland and hayland. Typical crops are barley and wheat.  Native vegetation includes basin big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, fescue, prairie junegrass, rabbit brush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Idaho.  This series is of small extent.
