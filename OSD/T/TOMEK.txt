TOMEK SERIES

The Tomek series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 71 centimeters (28 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.) at the type location.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: Loess, Deep borings in this soil indicate that most areas are underlain by sandy materials at depths of 1.8 to 6 meters (6 to 20 feet). 
Landform: Stream terrace plane in a paleo valley of the Platte River
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 11 degrees C. (50 to 52 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 69 to 74 centimeters (27 to 29 inches)
Frost-free period: 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Butler, Fillmore, Scott and Yutan soils.  
Butler soils contain more clay in the control section, are somewhat poorly drained, and are in swales.  
Fillmore soils contain more clay in the control section, are somewhat poorly drained, and are in swales subject to ponding for a short duration.  
Scott soils contain more clay in the control section, are poorly drained, and are in potholes subject to ponding for a long duration. 
Yutan soils are on slightly higher positions on the landscape and have mollic colors less than 10 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained  
Surface runoff: Low  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity:  Moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in cropland.  
Corn, soybeans, grain sorghum and winter wheat are the principal crops.  
The underlying sandy material is source of water for irrigation use.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nebraska.  The series is of moderate extent.
