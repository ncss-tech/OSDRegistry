TINNEY SERIES

The Tinney series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on inset fans on fan piedmonts. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amarose (NM), Berino (NM), Grizzle (AZ), Gulch (AZ), Headquarters (NM), McAllister (AZ), McNeal (AZ), and Redona (NM) series.  Amarose soils have series control sections that range to neutral and have hue of 2.5YR.  It also has Btk horizon with 25 to 40 percent clay.  The base of the argillic horizon is greater than 60 inches.  Berino soils do not have cambic horizons.  Grizzle soils are moderately deep to sandstone.  Gulch soils have accumulations of gypsum in the profile.  Headquarters soils have calcic horizons within 20 inches of the surface.  McNeal soils have calcic horizons within 20 inches of the surface.  Redona soils have up to 15 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Amarose and Redona soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June and occur in the Great Plains.  McAllister soils do not have a cambic horizon above the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium
Landform:  inset fans on fan piedmonts
Slope: 1 to 3 percent
Mean annual temperature: 60 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 12 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bankston, Bissett,  Crossen, and Reyab series.  Bankston soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on hills.  Bissett soils are shallow to bedrock and are on hills.  Crossen soils are shallow and very shallow to a petrocalcic horizon are on erosional fan remnants on the fan piedmont.  Reyab soils are fine-silty and do not have calcic horizons and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is medium.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for grazing livestock. Vegetation is of the desert grassland type consisting of tobosa, burrograss, threeawn, creosotebush, mesquite, tarbush, desert holly, and globemallow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42.  The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 17 to 36 inches. (2Bt horizon)

Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches. (A horizon)

Cambic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 17 inches. (Bw horizon)

Argillic horizon:  The zone from 17 to 36 inches. (2Bt horizon)
