Extent: Moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Beaufort County, South Carolina; 1975.

REMARKS: Particle-size data is available for this pedon. The April 1993 revision placed the Tomotley series in fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Endoaquults. In several older soil surveys in South Carolina, and possibly other states, soils correlated Tomotley may have siliceous mineralogy. Those soils are outside the range of the series and no geographically associated soils that have siliceous mineralogy were listed in the April 1993 revision of the Tomotley series.

Diagnostic horizons and soil properties recognized in the typical pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from depths of 7 to 42 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 
horizons)
