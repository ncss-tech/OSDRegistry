TRUCKEE SERIES

The Truckee series consist of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Truckee soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Truckee silt loam - irrigated cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    C2--53 to 64 cm;  gray (10YR 6/1) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, with many coarse faint very dark brown (10YR 2/2) organic stains and few fine faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) iron mottles; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    2C1--64 to 76 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist, with a few faint dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) iron mottles; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; very few very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.

    3Ab--86 to 165 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; about 75 feet east and 625 feet south of the northwest corner of section 21, T. 19 N., R. 20 E.; USGS Reno 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 30 minutes 13 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 45 minutes 7 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5036111 latitude, -119.7519444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Saturated between 50 and 100 cm for at least 3 months or more during most years.
Mean annual soil temperature: 10 to 12 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 50 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have Ab horizons that are slightly alkaline.
Effervescent: Violently effervescent to slightly effervescent except where Bq horizons are present or drainage has been altered.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  18 to 25 percent.

A horizon
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  1 or 2.
Other features:  Values of 4 and chromas of 3 may be present in areas with recent overwash.

C horizon
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 2 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 3.
Texture:  Stratified sandy loam through silty clay loam.
Other features:  Horizons below 90 cm may be gleyed.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Diyou and Mindlebaugh series. 

Diyou soils are noncalcareous to depths of 50 cm or deeper. Mindlebaugh soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 76 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Truckee soils are on flood plains and stream terraces cut through lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,190 to 1,480 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 180 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature of 10 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Rose Creek and Voltaire soils.  Rose Creek soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Voltaire soils are saturated during part of the year.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained (drainage now altered to somewhat poorly drained); very slow or slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  (Seasonal watertable is at 50 to 100 cm.)

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cropland, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is principally big sagebrush, sweet clover, red top, wiregrass, bluegrass, Timothy, willows, and wildrose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 26.
