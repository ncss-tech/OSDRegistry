TURRIA SERIES

The Turria series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Turria soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abgese, Ackley, Blacknest, Bluelight, Colbar, Eusbio, Greenbrae, Hardtrigger, Harsan, Hoosegow, Hoye, Lankbush, Morfitt, Nosser, Shawave, Sidlake, and Windypoint series.  

Abgese and Hoye soils have Btk horizons.  Ackley and Greenbrae soils have the base of the argillic horizon greater than 50 cm. Blacknest and Windypoint soils have sand and gravel within 100 cm. Bluelight, Colbar, Eusbio, Nosser and Sidlake soils have bedrock within 100 cm. Hardtrigger soils have secondary carbonates within 69 cm. Harsan soils have a duripan within 100 cm. Hoosegow, Lankbush and Morfitt soils lack free carbonates within 100 cm. Shawave soils have less than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Turria soils are on nearly level alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,310 to 1,620 meters.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C; and the frost-free season is about 60 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gardnerville, Haybourne, McFaul, and competing Greenbrae soils.  Gardnerville soils have contrasting textures and discontinuous silica cementation.  Haybourne soils have coarse-loamy control sections and lack argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Some areas have altered drainage due to seepage from higher lying canals and irrigated areas and are somewhat poorly drained with a seasonal high water table at depths of 1.2 to 1.8 meters.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing, urban development, and irrigated cropland.  The vegetation is principally spiny hopsage, big sagebrush, bud sagebrush, saltbush, and horsebrush with an understory of cheatgrass and squirreltail.  Irrigated areas are cropped to alfalfa hay and small grains.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  Turria soils are not extensive western Nevada. MLRA 26
