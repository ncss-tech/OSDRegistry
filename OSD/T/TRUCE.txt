TRUCE SERIES


The Truce series consists of soils that are deep over claystone bedrock. These well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in loamy colluvium and/or slope alluvium over clayey residuum derived from claystone of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on gently sloping to steep, convex ridges. Slopes are typically 1 to 5 percent, but range from 1 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bonti, Exray, Owens, Shatruce, and Thurber series.
Bonti soils: are 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in) deep to sandstone bedrock and occurs mainly on higher ridgetops with plane slopes
Exray soils: are less than 51 cm (20 in) deep to sandstone bedrock, and occurs mainly on higher ridgetops
Owens soils: are more alkaline, do not have argillic horizons, and occur on similar positions
Shatruce soils: are 51 to102 cm (20 to 40 in) deep to non-cemented claystone bedrock and occur on higher bouldery escarpments
Thurber soils: have clay loam surface layers, secondary carbonates within 76 cm (30 in) of the surface, and occur on lower nearly level or gently sloping positions

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is slow. Runoff is medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes, high on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and very high on slopes greater than 20 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly used as rangeland. A few small areas are cropped to small grains and sorghums. Climax vegetation is an open post oak savannah with tall and mid grasses such as indiangrass, big and little bluestem, and sideoats grama. Most areas contain other woody plants such as blackjack oak and elm with invading mesquite, cedar, and lotebush. Present herbaceous vegetation consists mainly of sideoats grama, Texas needlegrass, hairy grama, threeawns, sand dropseed, and other low producing perennials and annuals with western ragweed, Engelmann-daisy, bundleflower, prairie clover, primrose, and gayfeather.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Texas North Central Prairies (MLRA 80B) and West Cross Timbers of Texas. The series is extensive.
