TURNER SERIES 

The Turner series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and have very gravelly loamy coarse sand at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Shawmut and Martinsdale soils.  Shawmut soils are loamy skeletal.  Martinsdale soils are fine-loamy.  Shawmut and Martinsdale occur on similar landforms as Turner.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Permeability is moderate in the A and B horizons and rapid in the sandy-skeletal horizons. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Turner soils are used for dryland and irrigated crops and as rangeland.  Major crops are small grain and hay.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, little bluestem, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needleandthread, prairie sandreed, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Turner soils are mainly on the plains of central and eastern Montana.  They are extensive. MLRAs 52, 53A, 58A, 44B, and 46.
