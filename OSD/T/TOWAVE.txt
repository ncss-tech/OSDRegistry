TOWAVE SERIES

The Towave series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Towave soils are on north facing hillslopes.  Slopes range from 45 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Towave very channery loam, on a north facing, convex-concave, 70 percent slope in Douglas fir forest at an elevation of 6,600 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 70 percent channers and subangular gravel.

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few medium, common fine, many very fine roots; few medium, many fine and very fine tubular pores; slightly calcareous; carbonates are disseminated, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 20 percent shale channers and 10 percent sandstone channers in the horizon; 70 percent of the surface is covered with channers and gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    ABk--4 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; common medium, many fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as 1 to 3 mm thick coatings on the undersides of rock fragments, 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 50 percent channers; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk1--13 to 24 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few coarse, common medium and many fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as 1 to 3 mm thick coatings on the undersides of rock fragments, 9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 70 percent channers, 5 percent flagstone; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--24 to 36 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) extremely channery loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; loose, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse, common fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent; carbonates disseminated and segregated as 1 to 3 mm thick coatings on the undersides of rock fragments, 9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 85 percent channers, and 5 percent flagstones; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (9 to 40 inches thick)

    Bk3--36 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; loose, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; slightly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as 1 to 3 mm thick coatings on the undersides of rock fragments, 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 50 percent channers, 20 percent gravel and 5 percent flagstones; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 38 miles south of Ouray; located about 2,300 feet west and 500 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 8, T. 14 S., R. 21 E., SLBM; Wolf Point, Utah USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 36 minutes 30 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 35 minutes 26 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Typic Ustic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate:  4 to 11 inches
Particle-size control section:  18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments (predominantly channers).

A horizon:
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 15 percent

Bk horizon:
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture:  extremely channery loam or very channery loam
Rock fragments:  35 to 75 percent (the lower part of this horizon has horizontal beds of sandstone and shale with soil material between layers and in cracks)
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 15 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Bitton, Perma, Renegade, Wanagan, and the Wimper series.  Competitors prior to the Seventh Edition, 1996 Keys to Soil Taxonomy are the Datino, Heely, Labre, Osha, Pesmore, Peso, Pesowyo, Sandia, Slimbutte, Subwell, Veatch, and the Vigilante series.

Bitton, Perma, and Slimbutte:  have cambic horizons.

Datino, Labre, Subwell, Wimper:  have calcic horizons

Heely, Pesmore, Peso, Pesowyo, Veatch:  are moderately deep to bedrock

Osha, Renegade, Sandia, and Vigilante:  are deep to bedrock

Wanagan soils have soil moisture control sections that are affected by peak precipitation falling mainly in the spring and early summer

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Parent material:  colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.
Landform:  hillslopes (north aspects).
Slopes:  45 to 80 percent
Elevation: 6,200 to 8,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches.
Frost-free period:  70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gompers, Moonset, Seeprid, Soward, Tosca, Utso, Whetrock, and Winteridge series.  

Gompers and Moonset soils are hillslopes and are shallow.

Seeprid and Winteridge soils occur on plateau summits and have argillic horizons.

Soward soils occur in drainageways and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.

Tosca soils on mountain slopes and Whetrock soils on hillslopes have calcic horizons.

Utso soils occur on hillslopes and have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are woodland, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Potential native plant community is pinyon pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, Utah snowberry, birchleaf mountainmahogany, salina wildrye, slender wheatgrass, and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir.  This soil is correlated to Mountain Very Steep Stony Loam (Douglas-fir) - 048AY475UT range site in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah, 1998.  The name is taken from a nearby geographic location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (ABk, Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 13 inches.  (A and ABk horizons)

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.
