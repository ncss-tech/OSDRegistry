TANGLEWOOD SERIES

SERIES PROPOSED: Caldwell County, Texas, 2017, Caldwell County soil survey area, Texas, 2017. The name is from a community near the type location.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Demona series. The series was separated based on having a warmer soil temperature, having a wetter mean annual precipitation range, having a warmer mean annual air temperature range, occurrence in a different major land resource area, and different geologic material.

Additional Comments: 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from S09TX1870016 from Guadalupe County, Texas. This lab data is from a Robco pedon taken in a Demona mapunit.

ADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU Data from Williamson County, Texas taxonomic unit pedon S78TX-491-003. Particle-size analysis, salinity and sodicity tests were performed at the project office on 12 pedons.
