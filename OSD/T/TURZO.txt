TURZO SERIES

The Turzo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite rocks.  Turzo soils are on alluvial fans, fan terraces, stream terraces, and alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Moffat county, Colorado, Moffat County Area soil survey area, 1992. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 11 inches.  (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 11 to 30 inches. (Bw horizon)

The classification was changed from a Typic Torriorthents to a Typic Haplocambids based on revisiting the Turzo type location, 8/2008, jwb.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by a reference lab sample number S91UT-047-001 collected 4 April 1991.
