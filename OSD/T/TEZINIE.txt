TEZINIE SERIES

The Tezinie series consists of very deep, well drained, saline-sodic affected soils that formed in alluvium, stream alluvium, and fan alluvium derived from shale, and sandstone. Tezinie soils are on terraces and flood-plain steps. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are typically 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Tezinie clay loam-- farmland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tezinie soils are on low stream terraces on valley floors. Tezinie soils formed in stratified alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from Cretaceous and Tertiary shale and sandstone. Thin, locally derived deposits of eolian material are present in some areas. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,200 to  5,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches with high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F. The average frost-free period is  150 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Navajo, Gotho, Notal, Jeddito,and Nazlini soils. Navajo soils have a vertic subgroup and SAR less than 13 percent. Gotho, Notal, and Jeddito soils are Torriorthents.  Nazlini soils are coarse-silty. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Tezinie soils are used for livestock grazing and limited irrigated agriculture. Present vegetation is greasewood, saltcedar, shadscale, knapweed, nightshade, Russian thistle, rubber rabbitbrush, shadscale, fourwing saltbush, and alkali sacaton. The principal crops are alfalfa for hay, and grasses and legumes for pasture. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeast Arizona, MLRA 35, LRR-D. Tezinie soils are of limited extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Navajo County, Arizona; Chinle Soil Survey Area; 2010.  

REMARKS: Tezinie is the name of a wash and canyon near the type location. This English spelling of the Navajo word Tse Zhiin translates to mean Black Rock.
