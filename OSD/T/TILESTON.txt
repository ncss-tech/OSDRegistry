TILESTON SERIES

The Tileston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Tileston soils are on glaciated mountain slopes and moraines.  Slopes range from 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, isotic Typic Glossocryalfs

Gambler soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Granile, Leadville and Tolvar soils have greater than 50 percent base saturation.  In addition, Leadville soils have hues of 5YR or redder.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Recreation and wildlife habitat.  Primary vegetation is Engelmann's spruce, subalpine fir, limber pine with an understory of grouse whortleberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northcentral Rocky Mountains, Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Boulder County, Colorado, Rocky Mountain National Park soil survey area, 1999.  The name was taken from a mountain peak in the area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 13 to 33 inches.  (B/E and part of the Bt horizons)
Albic horizon:  The zone from 3 to 7 inches.  (E horizon)
Glossic horizon:  The zone from 7 to 13 inches.  (E/B horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 13 to 36 inches.  (B/E and Bt horizons)

The base saturation of this series is being studied. It is assumed that base saturation (by sum of cations) is greater than 35 percent at a depth of 125 cm below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon. Hence the base saturation is high enough to place this series in the Alfisols class and not in the Ultisols.
