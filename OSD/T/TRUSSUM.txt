SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major Uses: Woodland. A few small areas where artificial drained are used for cultivated crops, mostly corn and soybeans.
Dominant Vegetation: Wooded areas are dominantly red maple, sweetgum, blackgum, and willow oak.  The understory vegetation commonly consists of American Holly, sweetbay, greenbriar and highbush blueberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain of Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland
Extent: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Sussex County, Delaware, 1993.

REMARKS: These soils were previously included with the Elkton series.  The 2021 revision adjusts the horizon depths to allow the Oi horizon to be the surface of the pedon.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone form the soil surface to 7 inches (A and E horizons)
Albic horizon--the zone from 3 to 7 inches (E horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 56 inches (Btg and BCg horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 3 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)
