TUPMAN SERIES

The Tupman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and/or sedimentary rock. The Tupman soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 178 mm (7 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (64 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Fluventic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Tupman gravelly sandy loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes, in a fallow field, at an elevation of 122 meters (430 feet). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described on July 27, 1989, the soil was dry throughout.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tupman soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. Tupman soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and/or granitoid rock. Elevations are 109 to 407 meters (355 to 1,335 feet). The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 152 to 203 mm (6 to 8 in). The mean annual temperature is 17 to 18 degrees C (62 to 65 degrees F). Mean July temperature is about 29 degrees C (85 degrees F), and mean January temperature is about 4 degrees C (47 degrees F). The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kimberlina, Milagro, Pleitito, Pyxo, and Wasco soils. Kimberlina soils on floodplains and recent alluvial fans, Milagro soils on alluvial fans and fan skirts, Pleitito soils on alluvial fans and flood plains, and Wasco soils on recent alluvial fans and flood plains do not have a cambic horizon. Pyxo soils, on hills and mountains, are moderately deep and have slopes from 9 to 50 percent.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. These soils are subject to rare flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tupman soils are used for livestock grazing and for irrigated field and row crops, orchards and vineyards. Native vegetation is allscale saltbush, rabbitbush, red brome and redstem filaree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Along the rim of the Southern San Joaquin Valley of California, MLRA 17. The series is not extensive.
