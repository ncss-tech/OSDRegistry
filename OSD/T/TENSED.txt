TENSED SERIES

The Tensed series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium or tertiary alluvium from metasedimentary rocks and mixed with loess and an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Tensed soils are on dissected terraces and foothills. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  
These are the Fastjet, Luckycreek, Pagecreek, Pinney, Powellbutte, Runyon and Tommycork soils. The Fastjet soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact (volcanic rock). The Luckycreek soils are dry for 75 to 100 consecutive days. Pagecreek soils have horizons with secondary carbonates. Pinney soils formed in lacustrine deposits without loess. Powellbutte, Runyon and Tommycork soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact (volcanic rock). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tensed soils are on dissected terraces and foothills at elevations of 2,500 to 3,200 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived from metasedimentary rocks of the Belt series with a mixture of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part of the profile.  The average annual precipitation is 23 to 27 inches, including 4 to 5 feet of snowfall. The average annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F. The frost free period is 90 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pedee, Setters and Taney soils. Pedee soils are clayey-skeletal and are on adjacent dissected terraces and foothills. Setters soils are fine textured and on adjacent dissected terraces and hills.  Taney soils have a fragipan and are on adjacent dissected terraces and hills.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately low in the lower part. There is a seasonally perched water table at a depth of 22 to 30 inches from February to April.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for crop production and timber production.  The primary crops are small grains, hay and pasture.  The natural overstory is Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine.  The understory is ninebark, oceanspray, common snowberry, white spiraea, Nootka rose, Woods rose, pine grass, bedstraw and Columbia brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Benewah County, Idaho, MLRA 9. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Ap1, Ap2 and BA horizons) 
Cambic horizon - the zones from 12 to 22 inches (EB horizon)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 24 to 60 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons)
Particle-size control section - the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon (the zone from 24 to 44 inches)
Vitrandic feature assumed based on surrounding soils; MLRA investigation needed to determine extent of vitrandic influence for this series.
