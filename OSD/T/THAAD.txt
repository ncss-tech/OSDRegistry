THAAD SERIES

The Thaad series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium from tuff.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  The moisture control section is usually dry in some or in all parts for six-tenths or more of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Some part of the epipedon is moist for more than 90 cumulative days in most years when the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature - 55 to 59 degrees F.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section:   The zone between 12 and 32 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3)

Mollic epipedon:   The zone from 0 to 21 inches (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).

Argillic horizon:   The zone from 12 to 44 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).

Aridic feature:   An ustic moisture regime that borders on the aridic moisture regime.

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
