TRIPP SERIES

The Tripp series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty or loamy alluvium or loess. They are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tripp very fine sandy loam with a slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, friable; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  A--18 to 33 centimeters (7 to 13 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse angular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (Combined A horizon ranges from 18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) thick.)

  Bw1--33 to 51 centimeters (13 to 20 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine granular; hard, friable; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.

  Bw2--51 to 76 centimeters (20 to 30 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

  Bw3--76 to 89 centimeters (30 to 35 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (Combined Bw horizon ranges from 23 to 71 centimeters (9 to 28 inches) thick.)

  Bk--89 to 114 centimeters (35 to 45 inches); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; thread-like secondary deposits of carbonates; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick)

  C--114 to 203 centimeters (45 to 80 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska; about 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) north and 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) west of Minatare; 366 meters (1,200 feet) south and 30 meters (100 feet) east of the northwest corner, sec. 19, T. 22 N., R. 53 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum:  51 to 122 centimeters (20 to 48 inches) 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  18 to 51 centimeters (7 to 20 inches) 
Depth to free carbonates: 46 to 102 (18 to 40 inches)

A horizon: 
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5, and 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 
Texture: very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam and loamy very fine sand 
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline

B horizon: 
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 7, and 3 to 5 moist 
Chroma: 2 or 3 
Texture: silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam 
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Bk and C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 6 to 8, and 5 to 7 moist 
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam 
Reaction:  slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline
Some pedons have a small amount (less than 3 percent by volume) of pebbles on the surface or mixed throughout the profile. Also, some pedons have sand or sand mixed with a few pebbles below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the McConaughy and Oglala soils.
McConaughy soils have carbonates at depths less than 46 centimeters (18 inches) 
Oglala soils have bedrock within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches) 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: stream terraces
Landform: broad summits, convex shoulders, and side slopes
Slope: 0 to 9 percent
Parent material:  alluvium or loess
Mean annual temperature:  8 to 11 degree C. (46 to 52 degrees F.) 
Mean annual precipitation: 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alice, Bridge, Dix, Jayem, Keith, Kuma and Mitchell
Alice and Jayem soils are coarse-loamy and are slightly higher in the landscapes. 
Bridget soils are on foot slopes and alluvial fans. 
Dix soils have sand and gravel between a depth of 25 to 51 centimeters (10 and 20 inches) and are on breaks to stream terraces, alluvial fans and foot slopes. 
Keith soils are on uplands.
Kuma soils are fine-silty and are lower in the landscape. 
Mitchell soils are on foot slopes and fans.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high
Runoff: low to moderate depending on slope
Flooding: none or rare

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped and many areas are irrigated.
Wheat and millet are the principal dryland crops.
Corn, sorghum, sugar beets, alfalfa, field beans, and potatoes are the principal irrigated crops.
Native vegetation is a mixture of short and mid prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tripp soils are of moderate extent and are in western Nebraska, northeastern Colorado, southeastern Wyoming, and western South Dakota.
