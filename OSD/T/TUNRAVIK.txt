TUNRAVIK SERIES

The Tunravik series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian deposits over alluvium on terrace treads. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 0.6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, isotic over mixed Typic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Tunravik highly organic silt loam, located on a terrace tread with a slope of 1 percent and elevation of 31 meters; when described on July 31st, 2006 the soil was moist throughout (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

 Oi--0 to 7 centimeters; slightly decomposed plant material; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; extremely acid, pH 4.0; abrupt smooth boundary

 A--7 to 16 centimeters; very dark gray (5YR 3/1) highly organic silt loam; 26 percent sand; 67 percent silt; 7 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure parts to weak thin platy structure; nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; very strongly acid, pH 4.8; clear wavy boundary

 Bw--16 to 60 centimeters; 50 percent brown (7.5YR 4/4) and 50 percent olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) silt loam; 35 percent sand; 60 percent silt; 5 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure parts to weak thin platy structure; nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; moderately acid, pH 5.6; abrupt smooth boundary

 2C--60 to 183 centimeters; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) extremely gravelly coarse sand; 97 percent sand; 1 percent silt; 2 percent clay; single grain structure; nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots, few medium roots, and few coarse roots; 73 percent nonflat 5 to 76 millimeter fragments and 2 percent nonflat 2 to 5 millimeter fragments; moderately acid, pH 5.6
