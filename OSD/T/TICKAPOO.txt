TICKAPOO SERIES

The Tickapoo series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed alluvium derived dominantly from ignimbrite. Tickapoo soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tickapoo soils are on smooth or slightly convex alluvial fans at elevations of 1,460 to 1,680 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Tickapoo soils formed in mixed loamy alluvium derived mainly from ignimbrite. The climate is cool semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 150 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C and the frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Koyen, Leo, and Papoose soils.  Koyen soils have cambic horizons and coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Leo soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections. Papoose lack silica cementation.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; very slow through medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing. The dominant vegetation is galleta, bud sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, shadscale, winterfat, Indian ricegrass, spiny hopsage, Anderson wolfberry, and littleleaf horsebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Nevada, where the soil is moderately extensive. MLRA 29.
