TEEBAR SERIES

The Teebar series consists of very shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Teebar soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, hyperthermic, shallow Typic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Teebar very cobbly fine sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 30 percent pebbles and 25 percent cobbles. 

	A--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine vesicular pores; 30 percent pebbles and 25 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); violently effervescent; abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick) 

	Bk--2 to 7 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 50 percent pebbles; 3 percent fine soft calcium carbonate masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); violently effervescent; abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

	Bkm--7 to 72 inches; indurated petrocalcic horizon; massive; very rigid; brittle; a cap of laminar carbonate about 5 millimeters thick is present. 

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; about 46 miles south of Mesquite on Temple Mesa in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area; in a nonsectionized township about 1330 feet south and 1020 feet west of the northwest corner of section 11, T. 22 S., R. 69 E.; USGS The Temple, (NV,AZ) 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 36 degrees 2 minutes 20 seconds north latitude and 114 degrees 15 minutes 29 seconds west longitude; UTM 11s, 747032e, 3991741n; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part during winter and spring and intermittingly moist in the upper part following summer convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime. Has an aridic soil moisture regime. 

Soil temperature - 72 to 78 degrees F. 

Depth to petrocalcic horizon - 4 to 10 inches. 

Control section - Clay content: 6 to 15 percent.

 Rock fragments: 40 to 60 percent.

Calcium carbonate equivalent in the less than 20 millimeter fraction: 40 to 70 percent.

A horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR. 

Value: 4 or 5 moist. 

Calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction: 20 to 30 percent.

Bk horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR. 

Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist. 

Texture: Fine sandy loam or sandy loam. 

Structure: Subangular blocky or massive. 

Consistence: Soft or slightly hard. 

Calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction: 30 to 50 percent.

Other features: Less than 5 percent identifiable secondary carbonates. 

Bkm horizon - Thickness: more than 5 feet. 

COMPETING SERIES: At present, there are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Teebar soils are on summits of fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,200 to 2,600 feet. The climate is arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches, the mean annual temperature is 69 to 77 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 350 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Huevi soil. Huevi soils are very deep and have calcic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; very high runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush and white bursage. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30; These soils are not extensive.
