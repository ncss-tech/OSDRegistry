COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Depth class: very deep
Drainage class: poorly drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over loamy till
Landform: hill, depressions on till plains, depressions on terraces
Slopes: 0 to 20 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 35 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Cohoe and Redoubt soils. Cohoe and Redoubt soils are well drained and occur on hills and till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for forestry, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Native vegetation is mixed forest of Lutz spruce and birch, with an understory of watet tolerant shrubs and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is of small extent.
