TRUJILLO SERIES

The Trujillo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from coarse sandstone.  Trujillo soils are on hills, drainageways, and fans.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls
