TEELER SERIES

The Teeler series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in gravelly alluvium derived from mixed sources on fan remnants, terraces, and mountaintops.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Teeler gravelly sandy loam - rangeland, at about 7,900 feet elevation.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine discontinuous irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

     Bt--4 to 10 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky, plastic; many fine roots; many fine continuous irregular pores; thin discontinuous clay films on vertical ped faces; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

     Bk--10 to 60 inches; pinkish gray (5YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; strongly effervescent, carbonates disseminated and as thin pendants (concretions) on the bottom of coarse fragments; 50 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Sweetwater County, Wyoming; about 40 miles south of Rock Springs; in the SE1/4 of the NW1/4 of section 18, T12N, R103W; Red Creek Ranch USGS quad; approximate coordinates lat. 41 degrees 01 minutes 18 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 03 minutes 23 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: ustic moisture regime; the moisture control section is moist in spring and early summer, and intermittently dry in July and August.
Depth to continuous accumulation of calcium carbonate is 8 to 15 inches.
Mean annual soil temperature: 40 to 43 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 55 to 58 degrees F.

Particle-size control section (weighted averages)
Rock fragment content: 35 to 60 percent
Clay content: 20 to 35 percent

Bk horizon
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Coarse fragment content: 35 to 80 percent; and consist of 30 to 75 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobble, and 0 to 5 percent stones.
Texture, fine earth fraction: sandy loam or fine sandy loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: averages 15 to 30 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hoodling, Latigo, Maciver, and Nurkey series.
Hoodling soils are not clearly separated, but they are presumed to be more moist in the moisture control section in late July and August.
Latigo soils have a xeric moisture regime.
Maciver soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR throughout.
Nurkey soils have a xeric moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Teeler soils are on fan remnants terraces, and mountaintops.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  Elevation is 7,400 to 9,500 feet.  Annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 degrees to 42 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 54 degrees to 58 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 50 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Babb and Bowen soils.  The Babb series is not skeletal.  The Bowen series has schist or gneiss bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mostly as rangeland.  The native vegetation is mostly bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, mountainmahogany, mountain big sagebrush, black sagebrush, Idaho fescue, and spike fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Present known distribution is in southern Wyoming and adjacent parts of Utah. MLRA 34A, 47. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Henrys Fork Soil Survey Area, Wyoming and Utah, 1990. The type location is in Sweetwater Area, Wyoming, Southern Part.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 10 inches (A and Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon - from 4 to 10 inches (Bt horizon)
Calcic horizon - from 10 to 60 inches (Bk horizon)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 10 inches (entire Bt horizon)
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.

When established the Teeler series was classified as loamy-skeletal, mixed Argic Cryoborolls.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.
