THIMBLE SERIES

The Thimble series consists of shallow, well drained soils on hills.  These soils formed in alluvium from basalt and pyroclastics.  Slope is 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Aridic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Thimble cobbly clay loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 5/4) cobbly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent cobble, 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

    Btk1--1 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) very cobbly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on ped faces and lining pores; thin lime coatings on the undersides of rock fragments; 20 percent cobble, 10 percent stones, 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Btk2--7 to 13 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) very cobbly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films on ped faces and lining pores; lime coatings on the undersides of rock fragments; 20 percent cobble, 10 percent stones, 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick)

    Btk3--13 to 19 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular structure; hard firm, sticky and plastic; common medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; strongly effervescent, lime coatings on the undersides of rock fragments; 20 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones, 10 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

    2R--19 inches; basalt; discontinuous 1/8 to 3/4 inch hardpan; lime filling fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; about 6 miles northeast of Mount Trumbull; 800 feet south and 800 feet west of the northeast corner of section 14, T. 35 N., R. 7 W; Latitude 36 degrees, 26 minutes, 19 seconds N., Longitude 113 degrees, 0 minutes, 22 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 47 to 59 degrees F.

Rock Fragments - 35 to 75 percent cobble, gravel and stones

Carbonates - 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent

Clay Content - 35 to 60 percent in the control section

Depth to Bedrock - 8 to 20 inches

A horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 5YR, 10YR
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2.5 through 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist

Bt horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 5YR
Value:  3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Acti (NV) and Cedaran (NV) series.  Acti and Cedaran soils do not have calcium carbonate within the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Thimble soils are on hills at elevations of 5,000 to 7,200 feet.  They formed in alluvium from basalt and pyroclastics.  Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lomaki, Showlow, Yumtheska and the Wukoki series.  The Lomaki, Wukoki and Yumtheska soils are loamy-skeletal.  Showlow soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is Utah juniper, pinyon pine, sideoats grama, and muttongrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  This series is of limited extent.  MLRA is 35 and 38.
