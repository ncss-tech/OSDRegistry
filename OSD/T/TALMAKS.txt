TALMAKS SERIES

The Talmaks series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hills of plateaus.  They formed in loess with small amounts of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Longpen series. Longpen soils do not have EB or BE horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Talmaks soils are on hills of loess-covered basalt plateaus at elevations of 4,200 to 4,750 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in loess, which contains a small amount of volcanic ash in the upper layers.  The average annual temperature ranges from 42 to 43 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 26 inches.  The average frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Carlinton, Cramont(T), and Wilkins series.  Carlinton soils are on similar landscape positions and are moderately deep to a fragipan.  Cramont soils are at higher elevations and are in a fine particle-size class.  Wilkins soils are in drainageways, are somewhat poorly drained, and have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff, slow to rapid runoff when cultivated; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for woodland, cropland, and livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, and ponderosa pine with an understory of longtube twinflower, common snowberry, elk sedge, and goldthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  This soil is of small extent in northern Idaho.
