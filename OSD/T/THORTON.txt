THORTON SERIES

The Thorton series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and glacial drift over glacial drift on debris aprons, valley walls, and bedrock benches.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,700 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic, frigid Typic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Thorton ashy sandy loam, on a debris apron landform with a SW facing slope of 35 percent at 549 meters elevation under coniferous forest vegetation. When described on June 7, 2007 the soil was slightly moist throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Oi--0 to 4 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; abrupt wavy boundary.

	Oe--4 to 8 cm; moderately decomposed plant material; few very fine roots; abrupt wavy boundary.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boulderjud, Bulgar, Bullroar, Deardorf, Ferguson, Gutridge, Honeyjones, Huckle, Stalter, Threecent and Twobit series.   All these soils are ashy silt loam in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  In addition, Deardorf, Gutridge, and Threecent soils are deep to bedrock.  Boulderjud and Huckle soils are deep to a paralithic contact.  Stalter soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Thorton soils are on debris aprons, valley walls, and bedrock benches at elevations of 400 to 1,000 meters.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with reworked glacial drift over glacial drift.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,500 to 2,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 8 degrees C. Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cosho (T), Easy (T), and Tricouni (T) soils.  Easy soils have albic and spodic horizons and form on more stable portions of the same landforms. Cosho soils have coarser textures at depth and form on lower slopes. Tricouni soils have andic soil properties to a depth of less than 36 centimeters and form on the more active portions of each landform.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained soils, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is western hemlock, Douglas-fir and western redcedar with an understory of Cascade Oregongrape, vine maple, prince's pine, baldhip rose, pachistima, western rattlesnake plantain, broadleaf star flower, orange honeysuckle, red elderberry, serviceberry, twinflower, and white-veined wintergreen

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of moderate extent.
