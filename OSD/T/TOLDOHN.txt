TOLDOHN SERIES

The Toldohn series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium from shale and sandstone. The Toldohn soils are on escarpments and sideslopes of mesas, cuestas, ridges, breaks, and hills. Slope is 8 to 40 percent. The mean average precipitation is 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic, shallow Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Toldohn gravelly clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) gravelly clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; about 25 percent by volume sandstone gravel and shale fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    2BC--1 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; common fine shale fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 19 inches thick)

    2Cr--11 inches; weakly consolidated shale.

TYPE LOCATION: McKinley County, New Mexico; Pescado Quadrangle; 400 feet west and 600 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 14, T. 10 N., R. 17 W.; latitude 35 degrees, 06 minutes, 11 seconds and longitude 108 degrees, 35 minutes, 36 seconds.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Continuously moist in some part of the soil moisture control section November through April and intermittently moist July through October. The soil is driest during May and June. Aridic ustic soil moisture regime.
 
Soil Temperature - 48 to 55 degrees F.

Particle size control section - 40 to 60 percent clay

Depth to Paralithic Contact - 6 to 20 inches to shale

Calcium Carbonates  slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent, calcium carbonate is disseminated

Reaction - Neutral to moderately alkaline

A Horizon
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist
Chroma: 2 through 6, dry or moist
Rock fragments - 0 to 35 percent

BC and C Horizons
Hue: 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y
Chroma: 4 through 7, dry or moist
Value: 2 through 6, dry or moist
Textures: Silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, clay
Rock fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Yohalem (NM) series. Yohalem soils have secondary accumulations of calcium carbonates and are moist in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 60 days following the winter solstice.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toldohn soils are on escarpments and sideslopes of mesas, cuestas, ridges, breaks and hills. Elevation is 6,800 to 8,000 feet. These soils formed in slope alluvium from sandstone and shale. Slope is 8 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches which occurs as intense summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rain or snow. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deschell, Orlie, Hosta and Nizhoni soils. Deschell and Orlie soils are fine-loamy. Hosta soils are deep and fine textured. Nizhoni soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, woodland, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Potential native vegetation is pinyon, juniper, big sage, blue grama, cliffrose, mountain mahogany and oakbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern New Mexico and northern Arizona. MLRA 35, LRR-D. The series is of moderate extent.
