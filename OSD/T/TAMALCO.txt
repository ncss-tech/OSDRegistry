TAMALCO SERIES

The Tamalco series consists of moderately well drained soil on till plains. These very deep soils are very shallow to moderately deep to sodium. They formed in loess, or in loess and mixed loess and drift, that overlies a paleosol. These soils contain 15 percent or more exchangeable sodium in the subsoil. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1,016 mm (40 inches).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Series in closely related families are Coulterville, Darmstadt, Grantfork, and Piasa. Coulterville and Grantfork soils do not have natric horizons. Darmstadt soils average less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Piasa soils have chroma of 2 or less in the upper part of the B horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tamalco soils are on convex summits and sideslopes of ridges and on sideslopes of drainageways on the loess-covered till plains of the Illinois episode. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Tamalco soils typically formed in loess. Some pedons formed in loess and the underlying mixed loess and drift. Tamalco soils are underlain, at a depth of 1.0 to 2.0 meters (3.5 to 6.5 feet), by the Farmdale Geosol. The Farmdale soil is underlain by the Sangamon Geosol at depths greater than 200 cm (80 inches). The paleosol may or may not have been truncated by erosion prior to loess deposition. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1,067 mm (36 to 42 inches), frost-free period is 180 to 200 days, and elevation is 137 meters (450 feet) to 229 meters (750 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cisne, Cowden, Darmstadt, Hoyleton, Huey, Oconee, Piasa, and Richview soils. The poorly drained Cisne, Cowden, Huey, and Piasa soils are on talfs. In addition Cisne and Cowden soils do not have natric horizons. The somewhat poorly drained Darmstadt soils are on talfs, lower broad convex summits, or on similar sideslopes nearby. The somewhat poorly drained Hoyleton and Oconee soils are on talfs, or lower summits, and do not have natric horizons. The moderately well drained Richview soils do not have a natric horizon and are on slightly higher summits nearby. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched water table is from 43 to 91 cm (17 to 36 inches) at some time from February to April in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the surface and subsurface layers, low to moderately low in the upper subsoil, and moderately low in the lower subsoil and underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the surface and subsurface layers, very slow in the upper subsoil, and slow in the lower subsoil and underlying material 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Tamalco soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, and small grain are the principal crops. Native vegetation was hardwood trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Illinois. The series is of moderate extent in MLRAs 113 and 114B.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Montgomery County, Illinois, 1968. 

REMARKS: The classification of the Tamalco Series was changed from Typic to Aquic in 1/2009 as the aquic subgroup was added to Natrudalfs with the Eighth Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 28 cm (11 inches) (Ap, E, and BE horizons); natric horizon the zone from a depth of 28 to71 cm (11 to 28 inches) (Btn, Btkn horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data from Pedology Lab at the University of Illinois for the typical pedon was published in the 1969 Soil Survey of Montgomery County, Illinois. The pedon number is 59IL-135-003, and the lab number is 18350-18368. This pedon was re-sampled to update the redoximorphic features and provide horizon information to a depth of 203 cm (80 inches). Additional data from the National Soil Survey Lab and the University of Illinois are on file for several pedons. The typical pedon will be linked to NASIS data mapunit #517398.
