TEFTON SERIES

The Tefton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Tefton soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps and valley floors and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tefton loam, pastureland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 30 cm thick)

    Bw--13 to 43 cm, pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam stratified with very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick)

    C1--43 to 142 cm, pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loam stratified with fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; slightly effervescent; common prominent masses of yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist, iron concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (51 to 114 cm thick)

    2C2--142 to 178 cm; stratified very gravelly sand and gravelly loamy sand; 45 percent gravel; 2 percent cobble; neutral.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  La Plata County Area, 1982. The name is from a railroad siding.

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Cambic horizon:  13 to 43 cm (Bw horizon)
Lithologic discontinuity:  100 to 152 cm (2C2 horizon)
Endosaturation:  43 to 142 cm (C1 horizon)
Redoximorphic concentrations:  43 to 142 cm (C1 horizon)
Particle-size control section:  25 to 100 cm (part of the Bw and part of the C1 horizons)
Stratification occurs in the Bw and C1 horizons

The chroma of 2 in the C1 horizon is from the parent material, not from aquic conditions. 

Tefton soils have a mesic soil temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with an oxyaquic subclass.

The 4/2004 revision changes the classification from Aquic Ustifluvents to Oxyaquic Haplustepts based on recognizing the Bw horizon (formerly AC) as a cambic, and recognizing that the soil lacks iron depletions for an aquic subgroup.
