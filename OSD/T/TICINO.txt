TICINO SERIES

The Ticino series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Ticino soils are on hillsides and have slopes of 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:   Ticino gravelly fine sandy loam--woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 15 cm thick)

    A2--10 to 28 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; l5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt1--28 to 43 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many of all-size roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films coating ped faces and in pores; l5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt2--43 to 56 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and very fine, and common medium and coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular, and few medium pores; common faint clay films coating ped faces and pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 50 cm thick)

    Cr--56 cm; highly weathered metasedimentary rock with some roots and clay films in fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:   Washoe County, Nevada; on Peavine Mountain; l,400 feet east and 400 feet north of the southwest corner of section 24, T. 20 N., R. l8 E.; latitude 39 degrees 34 minutes 45 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 54 minutes 47 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5791667 latitude, -119.9130556 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   
Soil Moisture: Usually moist but are dry 80 to 100 days in late summer and fall; xeric soil moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature; 7 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 25 to 45 cm; includes the upper part of the Bt horizon.
Depth to paralithic contact: 50 to 100 cm.
Reaction: Neutral or slightly acid.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages from 18 to 35 percent. 
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent.

A horizons
Value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist. 
Chroma: 1 through 3.

Bt horizons
Value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist. 
Chroma: 3 or 4. 
Texture: Loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam 

COMPETING SERIES:   These are the Alexander, Ayoub, Cloud Rim, Cloudless, Dry Canyon, Isbell, Jacanyon, Kanlee, Maple Mountain and Paynecreek series.  

Alexander, Ayoub and Jacanyon soils have a lithic contact within 100 cm. Cloud Rim, Cloudless, Dry Canyon, Isbell, Maple Mountain and Paynecreek soils are deeper than 100 cm.  Kanlee soils have predominantly coarse sand in the fine earth fraction and are dry for less than 70 days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Ticino soils are on hillsides and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rock sources, mainly metasedimentary, andesite, and rhyolite.  Elevation is 1,830 to 2,744 meters.  Mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm.  Mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C and the frost-free season is 50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:   These are the Burnborough, Softscrabble, and Gabica soils.  Burnborough and Softscrabble soils are deeper than 100 cm.  Gabica soils have a lithic contact at less than 50 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:   Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:   Used mainly for grazeable woodland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Native vegetation is mountain mahogany, mountain big sagebrush, and mulesear wyethia.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:   Mountain ranges in western Nevada.  These soils are of small extent. MLRA 26.
