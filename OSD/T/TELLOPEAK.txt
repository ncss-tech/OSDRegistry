TELLOPEAK SERIES

The Tellopeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rocks. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 110 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1524 millimeters (60 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, mesic Lithic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tellopeak extremely gravelly sandy loam - under a stand of Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone and salal. When described on October 19, 2002 the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated).

(Combined thickness of A horizons is 4 to 20 centimeters) 

	Bt1--13 to 33 centimeters (5 to 13 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4), very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine, common medium and coarse roots; many fine, and common medium tubular pores; few patchy faint clay films on surfaces along pores; 45 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH5.8); clear smooth boundary. 

	Bt2--33 to 39 centimeters (13 to 15 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6), very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4), moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many medium, and common coarse roots; many coarse, and few medium tubular pores; many patchy distinct clay films on surfaces along pores; 40 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH5.8); abrupt irregular boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt horizons is 10 to 40 centimeters) 

	R--39 centimeters (15 inches); hard metabasalt with vertical cracks 10 to 14 centimeters apart. 

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California; Hoopa Tribal Nation, about 3 kilometers southwest of Hoopa on the summit of Telescope Peak; USGS Hoopa, California topographic quadrangle; the west half of section 10, township 7 north and range 4 east; WGS84 Decimal degrees 41.0023889 latitude; and -123.7131389 longitude; UTM 440025 meters E, 4539267 meters N, zone 10, NAD83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil Depth: Depth to metamorphic volcanic rock is 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches). 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st. The soil has a xeric moisture regime. 

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 57 degrees F). The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature is greater than degrees C. The soil has a mesic soil temperature regime. 

Base saturation: by the ammonium acetate method is more than 35 percent at 39 centimeters 

Surface Fragments: 55 to 75 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble

Soil reaction: moderately acid to slightly acid throughout the soil profile. 
Particle Size Control Section (weighted average): 

Clay: 18 to 30 percent. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles 

A Horizon 

Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR 
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist

Texture of fine earth fraction: coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loam
Clay content: 12 to 18 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 65 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles

Bt Horizons 

Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist

Texture of fine earth fraction: loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam
Clay content: 12 to 30 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains with slopes of 9 to 110 percent at elevations of 109 to 1468 meters (358 to 4816 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metavolcanic rocks. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F), and mean annual soil temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 57 degrees F). The growing season is about 75 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hospiter, Hewent, and Howler soils. Hospiter soils are very deep. Hewent soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Howler soils are very deep and do not have an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, watershed, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, tanoak, and Pacific madrone with an understory of salal, Oregon grape, poison oak, and bracken fern. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. These soils are of small extent.
