TYZAK SERIES

The Tyzak series consists of very shallow and shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum, colluvium and alluvium from limestone.  These moderately sloping to very steep soils are on hillsides.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tyzak is extremely channery loam--rangeland.  When described, the soil was dry throughout the profile.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 8 centimeters (0 to 3 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium common fine, and many very fine roots; few medium, common fine and many very fine tubular pores; 60 percent channery fragments and 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 centimeters (3 to 8 inches) thick)

  Bk--8 to 28 centimeters (3 to 11 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) extremely channery loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium, common fine, and many very fine roots; few medium, common fine and many fine tubular pores; 60 percent channery fragments and 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and occur as pendants of rock fragments, 27 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches) thick)

  R--28 centimeters (11 inches); hard limestone.

TYPE LOCATION: Platte County, Wyoming; about 42 kilometers (26 miles) Wheatland; 762 meters (2,500 feet) east and 762 meters (2,500 feet) south of the NW corner of Section 17, T-21-N, R-69-W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C. (44 to 47 degrees F.) 
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 28 to 58 centimeters (11 to 23 inches)
Depth to bedrock: 28 to 51 centimeters (11 to 20 inches) 
Particle-size control section (weighted average): 
Clay content: 18 to 27 percent 
Rock fragments: 35 to 85 percent 
Size: fragments and flagstones 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: extremely channery loam, very channery loam, or cobbly very fine sandy loam.
Rock fragments: 35 to 75 percent 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Bw horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR 
Value: 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist 
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: channery silt loam, channery loam or very channery loam and less commonly extremely channery loam or extremely channery silt loam.
Reaction: moderately alkaline 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 25 percent
Note: The Bw horizon may not be present

Bk horizon:
Hue: 7.5 or 10YR 
Value: 4 or 5  
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: extremely channery loam, very cobbly loam, and very channery loam 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 35 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Rockville and Tyzut series.
Rockville soils are at elevation 1158 to 1524 meters (3800 to 5000 feet).
Tyzut soils have a soil Ustic bordering on Aridic moisture control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent Material: residuum, colluvium, and alluvium from limestone 
Landform: hillslopes 
Slope: 8 to 60 percent 
Elevation: 1920 to 2438 meters (6,300 to 8,000 feet) 
Mean annual temperature: 4 to 7 degrees C. (40 to 45 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 38 to 48 centimeters (15 to 19 inches) 
Frost free Period: 85 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atchee, Clapper, Flynncove, Morval, and Tridell soils.
Atchee soils are on similar landscapes and do not have a mollic epipedon.
Clapper, Flynncove, Morval, and Tridell are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock.
Clapper and Tridell soils are on shoulders and in depressed areas associated with the limestone rock.
Flynncove and Morval soils are on glacial outwash terraces and plains formed from quartzite rock sources.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low and medium 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland, woodland, wildlife habitat and recreation.  
Native vegetation is mountain mahogany, needleandthread, spikefascue, antelope bitterbrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, and rock goldenrod.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Wyoming and northern Utah.  MLRA's 47 and 49.  The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: BOZEMAN, MONTANA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Uintah County, Utah, 1985.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are;
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) after mixing (A and Bk horizons)
Calcic horizon: the zone of secondary carbonate accumulation 3 to 11 inches. (Bk horizon)
Lithic contact: hard bedrock at 28 centimeters (11 inches) (R horizon)
Frigid temperature regime: the annual soil temperature at 51 centimeters (20 inches) is 7 to 8 degrees C. (44 to 47 degrees F.)

Updated the classification, competing series and placed in semitab format.  LRM 03/01

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
