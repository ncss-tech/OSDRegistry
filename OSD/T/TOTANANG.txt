TOTANANG SERIES

The Totanang series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The Totanang soils formed in loess and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Assumption, Aviston, Barrington, Blackberry, Buckhart, Catlin, Clare, Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont, Harrison, Keltner, and Saybrook series. Assumption soils have more than 28 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Aviston and Buckhart soils are more than 152 cm (60 inches) to horizons with more than 20 percent sand. Barrington soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Blackberry soils average less than 89 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Catlin, Dana, Danabrook, Geryune, Graymont, and Harrison soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Clare soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Keltner soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Saybrook soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Totanang soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 61 to 152 cm (24 to 60 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. These soils are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lafayette, Mahalaland, and Waupecan, soils. The somewhat poorly drained Lafayette soils have grayer profiles and are in slightly lower lying positions on the landform. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Mahalaland soils have dominantly gray profiles and are in lower lying areas. The well drained Waupecan soils are on slightly higher landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 76 to 107 cm (2.5 to 3.5 feet) during the winter and spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loess, high in the outwash subsoil, and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the loess, moderately rapid in the outwash subsoil, very rapid in the underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, and meadow are the main crops. A small proportion is in permanent pasture or woodland. In areas that are forested, oaks and maple are the most common tree species. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, chiefly blue stem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Indiana; MLRA 111D, and possibly in MLRAs 110 and 108A. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent. 

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Warren County, Indiana, 1998.

REMARKS: This soil was mapped as Waupecan, moderately wet, in Tippecanoe and Warren Counties Indiana. Transect information from these counties indicate the need for a new series. Loess capping was typically thicker than Tippecanoe. The typical pedon above was previously correlated Waupecan, moderately wet, in Warren County.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap, A horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 158 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).

Representative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153444 in MO 11.
