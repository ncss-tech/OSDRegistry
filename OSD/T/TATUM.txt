SERIES ESTABLISHED: Orange County, Virginia, 1927. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
a. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon).
b. Argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 33 inches (Bt horizons). 
c. Paralithic contact at 44 inches.
2006 revisions included minor text cleanup.
Horizon depths were modified to ensure soil description began at soil surface.
