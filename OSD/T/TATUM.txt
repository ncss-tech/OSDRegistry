SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Virginia
Extent: Moderate

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Orange County, Virginia, 1927.

REMARKS: 
2006 revisions included minor text cleanup.
Horizon depths were modified to ensure soil description began at soil surface.  The September 2025 revision corrected some of the formatting. No data was changed.

Tatum soils were formerly mapped in the Carolina Slate Belt.  Data showed that most of these soils had kaolinitic mineralogy.  Tatum soils are now restricted to soils formed from sericite schist, phyllite, or other fine-grained metamorphic rocks. Tarrus soils are now mapped in the Carolina Slate Belt.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) (A horizon).
Argillic horizon--the zone from 15 to 84 centimeters (6 to 33 inches) (Bt horizons).
Paralithic contact--soft weathered bedrock at 112 centimeters (44 inches)
