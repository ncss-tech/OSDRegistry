TWINPALMS SERIES

The Twinpalms series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy sediments dredged from submerged areas.  These very gently sloping soils are on low mounds on spoil pile areas.  These soils are subject to occasional flooding by high storm surge from strong tropical storms.  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Kenedy County, Texas; 2007.  Series proposed for Kenedy and Kleberg Counties soil survey area, 2004.  The name is from the local name of a spoil island near Baffin Bay.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Ijam series, undifferentiated groups Ustifluvents, Ustorthents, or Udipsamments, or the miscellaneous areas - spoil piles.
The series was established based on the difference in family particle size and soil moisture regime.
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Aquic conditions: 76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 in). (Cg1, Cg2 and Cg3 horizons)
Particle size control section: 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). (A2, C and Cg1 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 46 cm (0 to 18 in). (A1 and A2 horizons)
Masses of oxidized iron: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (A1, A2, C, Cg1, Cg2 and Cg3 horizons)
Iron depletions: depleted matrix at 71 to 203 cm (28 to 80 in). (Cg1, Cg2 and Cg3 horizons)
Endosaturation: The zone of saturation at 76 to 203 cm (30 to 80 in) in most years throughout the year.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size analysis on seven pedons, and salinity and sodicity tests on ten pedons performed at the soil survey project office.
