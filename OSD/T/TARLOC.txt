TARLOC SERIES

The Tarloc series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Tarloc soils are on hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tarloc gravelly loamy coarse sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

    A1--0 to 8 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 25 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to10 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 20 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly coarse sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, and few fine and medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular, and many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent fine gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

  Bt--20 to 56 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine, few fine and medium, and many very fine interstitial pores; common faint clay bridges between sand grains and common faint clay films lining pores; 25 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (36 to 66 cm thick)

    Cr--56 to 64 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) soft granitic rock; can be dug with hand tools; few roots in weathered material along cracks and seams in upper 8 cm.

TYPE LOCATION:  Carson City County, Nevada; about 2 miles north of Carson City; about 1,800 feet south and 2,600 feet east of the northwest corner of section 28, T. 16 N., R. 20 E.; USGS New Empire 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 13 minutes 29 seconds north and longitude 119 degrees 44 minutes 34 seconds W;, WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.2247222 latitude, -119.7427778 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to base of argillic horizon; 50 to 100 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent. 
Rock fragments: 20 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments is granitic rocks such as granodiorite.

A horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.
Rock fragments:  15 to 30 percent gravel.
Organic matter content: 0.8 to 2 percent.

Bt horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Gravelly coarse sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deadyon, Ratleflat, and Saralegui series.  

Deadyon, Ratleflat, and Saralegui soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tarloc soils are on hills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Glenbrook, Koontz, Mottsville and Sutro soils.  Glenbrook soils are sandy and shallow to paralithic contacts.  Koontz soils are loamy-skeletal, shallow to paralithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  Mottsville soils are sandy, very deep, and have mollic epipedons.  Sutro soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tarloc soils are used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and urban development.  The vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, desert needlegrass, spiny hopsage, and Nevada ephedra.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 8,200 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carson City Area, Nevada, 1975.

REMARKS:  Further study is needed to determine whether this series may more commonly have a mollic epipedon than an ochric epipedon.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 56 cm (Bt horizon).
Paralithic contact - The boundary at 56 cm to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 56 cm (Bt horizon).
