TWINROVA SERIES

The Twinrova series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Twinrova peaty loam, in pasture (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(combined thickness of Bt2, Bt3 horizons -- 25 to 50 cm)
