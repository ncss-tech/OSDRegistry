TWINADAMS SERIES 

The Twinadams series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from hard sedimentary and igneous rock. They are on cuestas, scarp slopes, hills, mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Twinadams very channery loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 4 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) very channery loam, dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; 40 percent channers and 15 percent flagstones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt--4 to 9 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) very channery clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and on surface of rock fragments; 50 percent channers; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)

    Bk1--9 to 17 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) very channery sandy loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine roots; 40 percent channers; common soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk2--17 to 28 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) very channery sandy loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 55 percent channers; common soft masses of calcium carbonate, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 13 inches thick)

    Cr--28 to 36 inches; pale yellow (5Y 7/3) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds that crush to sandy loam, olive (5Y 5/4) moist; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 16 inches thick)

    R--36 inches; sedimentary bedrock.

Amalia (NM) - are very deep

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - cuestas, scarp slopes, hills, mountain slopes and ridges 
Elevation - 4,500 to 6,500 feet
Slope - 4 to 60 percent
Parent material - slope alluvium or colluvium derived from hard sedimentary and igneous rock 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches
Mean annual temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackleaf and Thunderhead soils. The Blackleaf soils are shallow to lithic contact and loamy-skeletal. The Thunderhead soils are moderately deep and fine-loamy. These soils occur on similar landforms as the Blackleaf soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Twinadams soils are used mainly for rangeland. Native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, prairie junegrass, western wheatgrass, fringed sagewort, and big sage. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Twinadams soils are of moderate extent in southwestern Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B, and 46.
