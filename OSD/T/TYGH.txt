TYGH SERIES

The Tygh series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium weathered mostly from sedimentary bedrock and mixed with loess and ash.  These soils are on bottom lands.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tygh fine sandy loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 10 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (10 to 12 inches thick)

    C1--10 to 17 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; common prominent fine reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--17 to 30 inches, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; many prominent medium reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

    C3--30 to 41 inches, dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; common medium prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 2 percent gravel; few black (10YR 2/1) manganese stainings; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 inches thick)

    C4--41 to 46 inches, gray and dark gray (10YR 5/1 and 4/1) loamy sand, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; common large prominent reddish-brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; single grained; loose; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    2C5--46 to 60 inches, gray and dark gray (10YR 5/1 and 4/1) very gravelly sand, light gray (10YR 7/1) dry; common large prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) mottles; single grained; loose; few very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 75 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Wasco County, Oregon; 200 feet north of Fifteen Mile Creek in the northeast 1/4 northwest 1/4 southwest 1/4, sec. 33, T. 1 S., R 13 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry for a part of the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to very gravelly sand is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons have loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the lower 10 inches of the control section.

The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.

The C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 5 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has common to many, fine to large distinct or prominent mottles in 5YR or 7.5YR hue.  Thin lenses, ranging from silt to very gravelly sand are in the C horizons in some pedons.  The 2C horizon is sand or loamy sand with 50 to 85 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bunejug and Rose Creek series.  Bunejug soils have an accumulation of salts in the A horizons, have mottles in the lower part of the mollic epipedon, and have finely stratified sandy loam, fine and very fine sandy loam, loamy fine and very fine sand, silt loam, and light silty clay loam.  Rose Creek soils are mildly to strongly alkaline and are usually slightly calcareous.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tygh soils are on nearly level bottom lands at elevations of 200 to 1,800 feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered mostly from sedimentary bedrock and mixed with loess and ash.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F, the mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Endersby, Hermiston, and Pedigo soils.  Endersby soils lack mottles and are somewhat excessively drained.  Hermiston soils lack mottles, are well-drained and coarse-silty.  Pedigo soils are calcareous and coarse-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABLILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability.  The soil has a perched water table during the winter.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principal uses are hay and pasture.  Other uses are dryfarm small grains, range and wildlife.  Vegetation is mainly perennial grasses, white oak, and ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Oregon.  This series is inextensive.
