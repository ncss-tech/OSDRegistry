TOMBAC SERIES

The Tombac series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived dominantly from Dakota sandstone and shale.  Tombac soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 23 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tombac loam, on a southwest facing, simple, 6 percent slope in ponderosa pine woodland, at an elevation of 8,600 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on July 22, 1985.

    Bt2--26 to 37 inches; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) clay, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; few fine faint strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) lithochromic mottles; strong medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse roots; few very fine continuous pores; many prominent clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 15 to 40 inches)

    2C1--37 to 46 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; few fine faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) lithochromic mottles; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    2C2--46 to 61 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) clay, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; few fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) lithochromic mottles; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, very sticky and moderately plastic; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family at the present time. The Maudrey series, in a closely related family, has a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium over residuum derived from Dakota sandstone and shale.
Landform:  mesas.
Slopes:  1 to 15 percent
Elevation: 8,200 to 8,900 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  40 to 43 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  20 to 25 inches.
  Wettest months:  July and August receive slightly more precipitation than other months.
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, however the soils are still moist from snowmelt.
Frost-free period:  70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Behanco, Fughes, and Maudrey soils. 

Behanco soils are loamy-skeletal and have a cryic temperature regime and are on mesas at higher elevations.  

Fughes soils do not have the E/B horizon and have a thick mollic epipedon and are in drainageways and on hills.  

Maudrey soils have a thick mollic epipedon and the top of the argillic horizon is deeper than 24 inches, and are on mesas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow permeability; low runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for timber production, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Gambel's oak, mountain snowberry, serviceberry, mountain brome, western wheatgrass, Parry's danthonia, needlegrass, quaking aspen, muttongrass, and sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  The series is of small extent.
