TSEZHIN SERIES

The Tsezhin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale and quartz diorite on treads of fan terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fangio (NM) and Quagmeier (UT) series. Fangio soils have a paralithic contact at 79 inches. Quagmier soils depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches below the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tsezhin soils are on treads of fan terraces and alluvial fans.  They formed in alluvium derived from Triassic sandstone and shale and Tertiary quartz diorite.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches in New Mexico and 16 to 20 inches in Arizona, with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chazner, Katzine, and Wetherill soils.  Chazner soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon and have carbonatic mineralogy.  Katzine soils lack argillic horizons and occur on risers of fan terraces.  Wetherill soils are fine-silty and occur on eolian-mantled surfaces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tsezhin soils are used for livestock grazing wildlife habitat and fuelwood production.  Present vegetation is Utah juniper, pinyon, black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, muttongrass, and plains prickly pear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tsezhin soils are moderately extensive in northern Arizona and northwest New Mexico. MLRA 35.
