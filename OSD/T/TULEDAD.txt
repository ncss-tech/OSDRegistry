TULEDAD SERIES

The Tuledad series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived dominantly from volcanic rock. Tuledad soils are on summits of plateaus and hills. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, mesic Lithic Haploxererts

TYPICAL PEDON: Tuledad extremely cobbly loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered by 30 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles and 4 percent stones.

 A1--0 to 3 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak very thin and thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

 A2--3 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak very fine and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 5 cm thick)

 Bss1--8 to 25 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium and coarse roots; few very fine tubular pores; many pressure faces; common slickensides; vertical cracks 2 to 15 mm wide and 20 to 75 mm apart; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

 Bss2--25 to 38 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine and fine angular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine to medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; many pressure faces; common slickensides; few 5 to 15 mm wedge shaped aggregates; vertical cracks 2 to 15 mm wide and 20 to 75 mm apart; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt irregular boundary. (5 to 20 cm thick)

 R--38 cm; hard vesicular basalt.

TYPE LOCATION: Washoe County, Nevada; unsectioned; about 2,100 feet north and 170 feet west of the projected southeast corner Section 16, T. 35 N., R. 19 E.; about 0.25 miles south of Buckhorn Road and 1.5 miles east of Steer Lake; USGS Rye Patch Canyon 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 54 minutes 46.7 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 50 minutes 48.8 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.9129722 latitude, -119.8468889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry in summer through late fall. Aridic soil moisture regime bordering xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 36 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 40 to 60 percent.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 3.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Bss horizon
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 through 6, dry; 3 or 4, moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Structure: Prismatic, angular blocky, subangular blocky.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tuledad soils are on summits of plateaus and hills. These soils formed in residuum derived from volcanic rock. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,525 to 1,970 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devada, Nitpac and Tunnison soils. Devada soils have argillic horizons. Nitpac soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have argillic horizons. Tunnison soils are moderately deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Rangeland and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is low sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and phlox.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Washoe County, Nevada, Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area; MLRA 23. These soils are not extensive.
