TALPA SERIES

The Talpa series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum derived mainly from dolomitic limestone of the Blaine formation of Permian age. These very gently sloping to steep soils occur on interfluves and side slopes of hills and ridges on dissected plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Talpa gravelly loam--native range.

Quanah soils: occur on lower footslopes and are more than 152 cm (60 in) deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very slow to moderate in the bedrock. Runoff is high on 1 to 5 percent slopes and very high on slopes greater than 5 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used almost entirely as rangeland.  A few minor areas are cropped where deeper soils are associated.  Native vegetation consists of mostly grama species, buffalograss, little bluestem and shrubs.  Juniper is a common invader.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwest Texas and western Oklahoma; LRR H; MLRA 78B & 78C - Central Rolling Red Plains, and MLRA 78A - Rolling Limestone Prairies.  The soil is of large extent.
