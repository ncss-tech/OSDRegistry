TRID SERIES

Trid series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Trid soils are on mountains slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

(10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt3--50 to 86 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores; 65 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 40 cm thick)

    Cr--86 cm; weathered granitic rock with clay films lining weak fracture planes.

TYPE LOCATION:  Douglas County, Nevada; about five miles north and 13 miles east of Gardnerville, Nevada; about 500 feet east and 100 feet north of the south quarter corner of section 20, T. 14 N., R. 22 E.; USGS Mineral Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 3 minutes 26 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 32 minutes 10 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.0572222 latitude, -119.5361111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mollic epipedon thickness: 20 to 30 cm, includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.
Depth to paralithic contact:  50 to 100 cm.

Particle-size control section - Percent clay:  25 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  1 through 3.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

Bt1 and Bt2 horizon
Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value (upper part):  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist. (lower part) 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4 with the lower chromas in upper part.
Texture:  Very or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam or clay loam.

Bt3 horizon
Texture:  Coarse sandy loam, loam or clay loam, modified by 40 to 65 percent rock fragments.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Eaglerock, Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Searles, Searvar, Shawmount, Shree, Shroe, Tollgate and Tristan series. 

Ashue, Badena, Badenaugh, Lemm, Leviathan, Nosrac, Oest, Shawmount, Shree, Shroe, Tollgate, and Tristan soils lack a lithic or paralithic contact within 100 cm. Eaglerock and Searvar soils have less than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister and Searles soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trid soils are on mountain back slopes, with mainly a south aspect at elevations of 1,370 to 2,286 meters.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in residuum derived from granitic rocks with some colluvial influence.  The climate is dry, with warm summers and moist, cool winters.  The average annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mainly as snow; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C.  The frost- free season is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Drit, Glean, Minneha, and Roloc soils.  Drit soils are deep and lack an argillic horizon.  Glean soils are deep, lack an argillic horizons and have a frigid soil temperature.  Minneha soils are shallow.  Roloc soils are shallow to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is principally mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, ribes, and Thurber's needlegrass with invasion of singleleaf pinyon pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The soils are of small extent.
