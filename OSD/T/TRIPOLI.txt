TRIPOLI SERIES

The Tripoli series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in 30 to 70 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying till. Tripoli soils are on nearly level or slightly concave positions on dissected till plains of low relief on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

REMARKS: 
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters;
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: 
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to 46 centimeters (Ap, A1 and A2 horizons); 
cambic horizon--the zone from 46 to 97 centimeters (Bg, 2Bw1, and 2Bw2 horizons); 
aquic suborder based on matrix color and redoximorphic concentrations in the zone from  a depth of 46 to 58 centimeters (Bg horizon). 

Some pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 30 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.

Cation exchange class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
