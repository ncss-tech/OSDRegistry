TOTTLES SERIES

The Tottles series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Tottles soils are on stream terraces and drainageways and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 432 cm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Cumulic Vertic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tottles clay loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 15 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  

    A2--15 to 53 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  

    A3--53 to 91 cm; black (N 2/0) clay, black (N 2/0) moist; weak subangular blocky structure; hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) iron concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (combined thickness of A1, A2, A3 - 63 to 148 cm thick)

    Cg1--91 to 137 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) iron concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (33 to 91 cm thick)

    Cg2--137 to 152 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) iron concentrations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  None listed.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform - stream terraces and drainageways
Elevation - 2,190 to 2,590 meters
Slopes - 0 to 2 percent
Parent material - alluvium from shale and sandstone
Mean annual air temperature - 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation - 410 to 510 mm
Frost-free period - 80 to l00 days
Soil Moisture:  a seasonal water table is at or near the surface (top depth - 15 to 41 cm) for at least one month during most years mainly during the months of April through June. In late summer the water table drops below a depth of 91 to 107 cm. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tottles soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is western wheatgrass, sedges, and redtop.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern New Mexico and southern Colorado; LRR D, E; MLRA 36, 48A; small extent.
