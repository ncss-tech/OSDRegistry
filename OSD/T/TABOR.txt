TABOR SERIES

The Tabor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on stream terraces and terrace remnants along river valleys on Inland dissected coastal plains.  The  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F)

Native vegetation is bunch grasses such as bluestems, Indiangrass, and Purple top.  Common trees consist of post oak, blackjack oak, elm, and hackberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mainly in east central Texas.  The soil is extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Angelina County, Texas; 1903.

REMARKS:  Classification change from Udertic Paleustalfs to Oxyaquic Vertic Paleustalfs based on recognition that these soils have short periods of iron reduction and oxidation evidenced by small zones of iron concentration and diffuse zones of iron depletion within 102 cm (40 in) of the surface.  In addition, associated soils have demonstrated the same micromorphological responses to short periods of oxidation and, to a lesser extent, reduction.

Argillic horizon: 36 to 203 cm (14 to 80 in) (Bt, Btg, and BCtg horizons)
Abrupt textural change: 36 cm (14 in) between the E and Bt1 horizon.
Albic materials: 15 to 36 (6 to 14 in) (E horizon)
Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less: 145 to 203 cm (57 to 80 in) (Btg, BCtg1, BCtg2 horizons)
Redox concentrations: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in)
Vertic features: 36 to 145 cm (14 to 57 in) COLE greater than 0.07.
