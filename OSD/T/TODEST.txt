TODEST SERIES

The Todest series consists of moderately deep to limestone, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian material, alluvium, and slope alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone. Todest soils are on dip slopes of cuestas. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Todest fine sandy loam-woodland. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; carbonates are disseminated; very slightly effervescent, 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    Bt--1 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; few faint clay films bridging sand grains; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

    Btk1--3 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and few medium roots; common fine irregular pores; many distinct clay films coating faces of peds and bridging sand grains; carbonates are disseminated and segregated in few very fine and fine masses; strongly effervescent, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. 

    Btk2--10 to 18 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; common fine irregular pores; many distinct clay films coating faces of peds; common fine calcium carbonate concretions; calcium carbonate is disseminated and segregated in many fine masses; violently effervescent, 23 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Btk horizons is 11 to 17 inches.)

    Bk--18 to 25 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; common fine irregular pores; common fine calcium carbonate concretions; calcium carbonate is disseminated and segregated in many fine masses and coating rock fragments; violently effervescent, 48 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; 5 percent limestone gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick)

    R--25 inches; limestone.

TYPE LOCATION: McKinley County, New Mexico; Thoreau Quadrangle; about 3.5 miles northeast of Thoreau, New Mexico; 108 degrees 10 minutes 27 seconds west longitude, 35 degrees 26 minutes 9 seconds north latitude.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alire (T) (NM), Brumley (CO), Goesling (NM), Maia (NM), Nomrah (NM), Nomrah (NM) and Pollow (T) (UT) series. Alire, Brumley, Goesling, Maia, and Nomrah soils are very deep. Pollow soils exclude any part of the argillic horizon from the calcic. Banquito soils are inactive.  Pollow soils have soil temperatures less than 50 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Todest soils formed in eolian material, alluvium, and slope alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone and are on dip slopes of cuestas. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevation is 7,000 to 7,700 feet. The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches. The frost free period is 115 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Shadilto and Vessilla soils. Shadilto soils are on dip slopes of cuestas and are shallow to limestone. Vessilla soils are on escarpments of cuestas and are shallow to sandstone.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, and moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for limestone products, wood products and livestock grazing. The present vegetation is pinyon, oneseed juniper, rabbitbrush, yucca, winterfat, blue grama and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico. MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
