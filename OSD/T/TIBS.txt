TIBS SERIES

The Tibs series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone or reddish-colored shale interbedded with calcareous sandstone. These soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Tibs cobbly clay loam, in forestland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 Oi--0 to 1 inch; forest litter of undecomposed and decomposed needles, twigs, and cones. (1 to 3 inches thick)

 A1--1 to 3 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; 20 percent angular cobbles; 10 percent angular gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

 A2--3 to 7 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; common medium and many fine pores; 25 percent angular cobbles; 10 percent angular gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

 Bk--7 to 13 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots; common medium and many fine pores; 25 percent angular cobbles; 15 percent angular gravel; common fine soft masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

 C1--13 to 31 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) very cobbly clay, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; strong fine angular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine, medium, and coarse roots in the upper part; common fine, medium, and coarse roots in the lower part; many fine and medium pores; 30 percent angular cobbles; 20 percent angular gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 18 inches thick)

 C2--31 to 60 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) very cobbly clay, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, very sticky, very plastic; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; common fine and medium pores; 35 percent angular cobbles; 20 percent angular gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

USE AND VEGETATION: Tibs soils are used mainly for forest products, rangeland, watershed, and recreation. The potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with an understory of common snowberry, white spiraea, Woods rose, Oregongrape, kinnikinnick, meadowrue, Richardsons needlegrass, western yarrow, timothy, pinegrass, common juniper, and russet buffaloberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tibs soils are of limited extent in the mountains of central Montana; MLRA 43B, 44, and 46.
