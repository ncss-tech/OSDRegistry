TOMBAR SERIES

The Tombar series consists of moderately deep over carbonate-cemented hardpan, well drained soils that formed in material derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Tombar soils occur on mountain slopes and hills of 2 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Petrocalcic Palexerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tombar gravelly loam - rangeland.  The rock fragment mantle on the surface is about 2 percent stones, 10 percent cobbles and 35 percent gravel. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(5 to 13 cm thick)

    AB--10 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly light clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and common fine and very fine roots; common medium, fine and very fine random tubular pores; 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent gravel neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--25 to 38 cm brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; few medium and common fine and very fine random tubular pores; 10 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2) gradual wavy boundary. (15 to 20 cm thick)

    Btk--38 to 46 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium fine and very fine roots; few medium and common fine and very fine random tubular pores; 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and in common medium accretions; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 18 cm thick)

    Bk--46 to 71 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; strongly cemented, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic, few medium fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine random tubular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 50 percent gravel; violently effervescent, carbonates are disseminated and in many medium accretions and on gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 31 cm thick)

    Bkkm--71 cm; indurated carbonate cemented hardpan.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: mountains slopes and hills 
Elevation: 1,675 to 2,300 meters

Slopes: 2 to 40 percent
Mean annual temperature: 7 to 9.5 C.
Mean summer temperature: 17.2 to 21.1 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 300 to 400 mm 
Freeze-free period: 90 to 130 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Birdow, Lucero, Pavant, and Wenzel soils. Birdow, Lucero and Wenzel soils do not have a hardpan and are more than 150 cm deep. Also, Birdow soils do not have an argillic horizon. Wenzel soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments within the particle-size control section. Pavant soils are less than 51 cm deep to the hardpan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat.  The natural vegetation is dominantly big sagebrush, scattered juniper, bluebunch wheatgrass, cheatgrass, threeawn and Indian ricegrass.  These soils are correlated to upland ecological sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah. This soil is of small extent.  MLRA 28A

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to 46 cm. (A, AB, Bt, Btk horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone of clay accumulation from 10 to 46 cm  (Bt, Bt2, Btk horizons).
Calcic horizon - The zone of carbonate accumulation from 46 to 71 cm (Bk horizon).
Petrocalcic horizon - The zone of indurated carbonates at 71 cm.  (Bkkm horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 46 cm (Bt, Bt2, Btk horizons).

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006".  The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data.
