THREERIV SERIES

The Threeriv series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Fluvaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Threeriv loam, in pastureland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oe--0 to 4 inches; partially decomposed sedges, rushes and grasses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Ag--4 to 9 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; few fine prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine, and common medium roots; 10 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0). (2 to 9 inches thick)

    Cg--9 to 29 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy clay loam consisting of strata of sandy clay loam and sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; common fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) redox concentrations; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; 10 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (15 to 31 inches thick)

    2C--29 to 60 inches; variegated extremely gravelly loamy sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 60 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES:
Beavrock (MT) - have a seasonal high water table at 12 to 24 inches

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - flood plains
Elevation - 4,000 to 6,500 feet
Slope - 0 to 2 percent
Parent material - alluvium
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 18 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 38 to 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; moderately slow over rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Threeriv soils are used mainly for pasture and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation may include tall reedgrasses, tall sedges and rushes, American sloughgrass, iris, willows, waterbirch, dogwood and silver buffaloberry, as well as other forbs, grasses, sedges and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Threeriv soils are of small extent in Southwestern Montana. MLRA - 44B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (Oe, Ag horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity - at 29 inches (2C horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 14 to 44 inches (part of Cg, part of 2C horizons)

Threeriv soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aquic moisture regime.
