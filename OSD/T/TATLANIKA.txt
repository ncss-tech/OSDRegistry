Mean annual soil temperature: 26 degrees F., 50 cm
Thickness of organic materials: 3 to 7 inches, 7 to 18 cm
Texture of the fine silty mantle: silt loam or silty clay loam
Texture of the permafrost substratum: permanently frozen material
Percent clay in the fine silty mantle: 20 to 35 percent
Thickness of cryoturbation and gelic materials: 16 to 32 inches, 43to 82cm
Depth to permafrost: 20 to 39 inches, 50 to 100 cm

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: slightly or moderately decomposed plant material
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid 

A horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 3; chroma of 1 to 2
Texture: silt loam , silty clay loam or silty clay
cryoturbation and gelic materials: 5 to 25 percent
Reaction class: moderately acid or slightly acid

Bjjg horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5Y to N; value of 3 to 5; chroma of 0 to 2
Redoximorphic concentrations: hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 4 to 6 
Redoximorphic depletions: hue of 2.5Y to N; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 0 to 2

COMPETING SERIES: There are no soils in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: fine-silty alluvium
Landform: flood plain
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 28 degrees F., -5 to -2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 15 inches, 250 to 380 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Totalanika and Liscum soils. Totatlanika soils are on similar landform and drainage but have a Histic epipedon.  Liscum soils are in depressions, are very poorly drained and do not have permafrost.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: very poorly or very poorly drained, slow runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow in the fine silty mantle and impermeable in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for recreation and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation includes black spruce and ericaceous shrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229, Interior Alaska Lowlands, The series is of moderate extent.
