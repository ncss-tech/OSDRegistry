COMPETING SERIES: There are no soils competing in this family 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: fine-silty alluvium
Landform: flood plain
Slope: 0 to 2 percent
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 28 degrees F., -5 to -2 C.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 15 inches, 250 to 380 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Talanika and Liscum. Tatlanika soils are on similar landform and drainage but do not have a Histic epipedon.  Liscum soils are in depressions, are very poorly drained and lack permafrost.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: very poorly or poorly drained, low runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity rapid in the fibric soil material, slow in the sapric and fine silty mantle and impermeable in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation includes black spruce and ericaceous shrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 229, Interior Alaska Lowlands, The series is of moderate extent.
