Fields soils have a mollic epipedon, lithic contacts within 2 m (79 in) of the soil surface, and occur on mountain slopes and hillslopes.
Greylingcreek soils are excessively drained, have very stony parent material, and occur on moraines and mountain valleys.
Mentasta soils are well drained, have a loess cap, and occur on till covered hillslopes
Stibnite soils are well drained, have a 15 to 35 cm (6 to 14 in) cambic horizon, and occur on till plains, mountains, kames and kettles.
Tasta soils are well drained, have very gravelly mollic epipedons, and occur on mountain slopes above 800 m (2600 ft) elevation.
