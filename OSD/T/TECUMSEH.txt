TECUMSEH SERIES

The Tecumseh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till. The Tecumseh soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashdale, Broadwell, Dinsdale, Douglas, Elkhart, Elmont, Gymer, Healing, Lycurgus, Malcolm, Meadowbank, Mendota, Mickle, Ogle, Osco, Parkway, Plano, Proctor, Richwood, Ripon, Sibley, Sidell, Tama, Toddville, Wakenda, and Waupecan series. Ashdale soils have more than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Broadwell, Douglas, Parkway, and Plano soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to horizons with more than 25 percent sand. Dinsdale soils have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the series control section. Elkhart, Elmont, Malcolm, Mendota, and Richwood soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Gymer soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Healing soils have mean annual temperature greater than 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and are formed in alluvial sediments. Lycurgus, Osco, Tama, and Wakenda soils have less than 30 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Meadowbank and Toddville soils have more than 50 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Mickle soils have more than 50 percent silt in the lower part of the series control section. Ogle soils have matrix color with hue redder than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section. Proctor soils do not have horizons formed in till in the lower part of the series control section. Ripon soils have sola terminated by a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Sibley soils have a mollic epipedon that is thicker than 61 cm (24 inches). Sidell soils do not have loamy glaciofluvium material above the till (see REMARKS). Waupecan soils have a horizon in the middle part of the series control section with more than 5 percent gravel.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tecumseh soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. They are on lower lying portions of the till plains which are typically near outwash plains or stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till. The till contains strata of coarser material in many places. Sandy and gravelly textures are within a depth of 2.4 to 3.6 meters (8 to 12 feet) in many places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 11 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Lauramie and Mellott soils. Lauramie soils have more sand in the upper part of the sola and are on more sloping areas in the landform. Mellott soils are on similar landform positions but have dark colored surface layers less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, or small grain. A few areas are used for hay or pasture. Native vegetation is tall prairie grasses, chiefly big bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Indiana; MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Tippecanoe County, Indiana, 1993.

REMARKS: Differentiae separating Tecumseh series and Sidell series are unclear based on current series concepts. The 6/87 revision of Sidell Official Series Description indicates that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying loamy glaciofluvium and till, same as Tecumseh series. Historical records indicate that Sidell series formed in loess and the underlying till, and it is believed that this is the correct series concept. This will need to be investigated and resolved during MLRA updating activities.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (Ap, A horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 165 cm (Bt, 2Bt, 3Bt horizons).
