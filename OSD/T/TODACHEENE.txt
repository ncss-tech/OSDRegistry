TODACHEENE SERIES

The Todacheene series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt and basaltic tuff. Todacheene soils are on footslopes and fan terraces of mesas and calderas and are moderately permeable. Slopes are 5 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

Bowbells, Flaxton, Hereford, Pachel, and Weed soils are calcareous above a depth of 40 inches or immediately below the solum if thicker than 40 inches and have continuous horizons of visible calcium carbonate accumulation. Carfall soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and elevations less than 3500 feet.  Center Creek soils contain mottles within 20 to 40 inches and are somewhat poorly drained. Cambern and Chugcreek soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Detra, Hesperus, Schauson, and Weed soils have mean summer soil temperatures above 57 degrees F. Fiesta soils have rock fragments derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Jaythree soils formed in alluvium derived from arkosic sandstone and shale. Shermap soils formed in eolian deposits, and slope alluvium derived from sandstone. Tschicoma soils formed in slope alluvium derived from latite, dacite, and rhyolitic tuff. In addition, Detra soils formed in materials derived from limestone, sandstone, and shale; Hesperus soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR; and Schauson soils have moisture control sections that are dry for 50 to 55 percent of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Laceycreek soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR. Bowbells, Carfall, Chugcreek, Flaxton, Hesperus, Laceycreek, Ohwiler, and Pachel soils are in LRRs E, F, and G and are moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Todacheene soils are on footslopes and fan terraces of mesas and calderas. They formed in alluvium derived from Tertiary basalt and basaltic tuff. Slopes are 5 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Owlspring (T), Sonsela (T), Viewpoint (T), and Washpass (T) soils. Owlspring soils are fine-silty, somewhat poorly drained, and occur on adjacent toeslopes.  Sonsela soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes. Viewpoint soils are shallow to basalt, and occur on adjacent shoulders and knolls. Washpass soils are coarse-loamy, have a cryic temperature regime, and occur on north-facing slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION: Todacheene soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is Kentucky bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, needleleaf sedge, pingue, silvery lupine, and pussytoes, with scattered Gambel oak, ponderosa pine, and Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Todacheene soils are of small extent on the Defiance Uplift-Chuska Mountains portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona.  MLRA 35.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Juan County, New Mexico, Shiprock Area Soil Survey, 1993. Todacheene is a local place name.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 18 inches.  (A, BA, and Bt1 horizons)

Pachic subgroup - The presence of a mollic epipedon that is greater than 16 inches thick.

Argillic horizon - The zone from 6 to 37 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

The Todacheene series was originally proposed and later dropped from the adjacent Fort Defiance Area soil survey.

ADDITIONAL DATA: A pedon within this series concept was sampled by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) at the original type location as pedon # S86-NM-045-001. Organic carbon values were extrapolated from this data.
