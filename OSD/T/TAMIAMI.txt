2R horizon: weakly to strongly cemented oolitic limestone bedrock, with solution holes filled with sandy and/or marly materials. Solution holes can be up to 100 centimeters (40 inches) or deeper.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Cooper Town, Gator Lake, Macks Camp, and Shark Valley soils.
Cooper Town soils: lack stratification of marly materials and are shallow to limestone bedrock
Gator Lake soils: lack stratification of marly materials and are very shallow to limestone bedrock
Macks Camp soils: have bedrock at depths of 100 to 150 centimeters, lack stratification of marly materials within the control section, and occur in similar landform positions
Shark Valley soils: have bedrock at similar depths of 50 to 100 centimeters, occur on similar landform positions, but lack stratification of marly materials within the control section

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): Talfs, rises, and/or dips on freshwater marshes, swamps, or low broad flats
Parent material: well decomposed organic materials stratified with silty marl deposits over oolitic limestone bedrock
Mean annual air temperature: 23 to 27 degrees C (73 to 81 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 940 to 1570millimeters (37 to 62 inches) 
Frost free duration: 365 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buffalo Tiger, Loxahatche, and Plantation soils. 
Buffalo Tiger soils have limestone bedrock at depths greater than 150 centimeters (60 inches), lack stratification of marly deposits and occur in similar landform positions.
Loxahatche soils are very deep, lack limestone bedrock within 200 centimeters (80 inches) and are in similar landform positions.
Plantation soils have sandy layers below organic materials that are 25 to 40 centimeters thick above the limestone bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage class: Very poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): high to very high in the Oa horizons, moderately high in the limnic materials
Surface runoff: negligible
Depth to seasonal high water table: Under natural conditions the water table is within 15 centimeters (6 inches) of the surface for 9 to 11 months during most years, except during extended dry periods; currently the water table is controlled by anthropogenic activities.
Ponding frequency and duration: Frequent for very long durations
Hydric Indicators: A1 Histosol, A8 Muck Presence, and F10 Marl

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: wildlife habitat, water quality, water storage, and recreation.
Dominant vegetation: sawgrass on rises and talfs, sedges and other water tolerant plants in dips, and willow and Melaleuca are common tree species near built up areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
General area: Florida Everglades and associated areas
Land Resource Region: U - Florida Subtropical Fruit, Truck Crop and Range Region
Major Land Resource Area: 156A 
Extent: Moderate   

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama.
