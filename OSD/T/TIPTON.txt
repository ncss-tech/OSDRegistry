TIPTON SERIES

The Tipton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous loamy and silty alluvium of late Pleistocene or Holocene age on nearly level to moderately sloping upland terraces in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in) and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).

    BC--102 to 168 cm (40 to 66 in); reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) loam, strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, friable; few masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the BC horizon is 50 to 75 cm [20 to 30 in]) 

    Ck--168 to 183 cm (66 to 72 in); reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) loam, yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; many masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.
