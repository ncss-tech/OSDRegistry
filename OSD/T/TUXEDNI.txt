COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: somewhat poorly drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over loamy till
Landform: hills and till plains
Slopes: 0 to 25 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 30 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Chunilna and Whitsol soils. Chunilna soils are very poorly drained and occur on depressions. Whitsol soils are well drained and occur on hills and till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained, very low to medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the solum and high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for forestry, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Native vegetation is Lutz spruce, paper birch with an understory of alder, tall grass, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is of small extent.
