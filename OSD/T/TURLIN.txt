TURLIN SERIES

The Turlin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces, in drainageways and floodplains, on base slopes and on alluvial fans. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Winneshiek County, Iowa, 1970

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 39 inches) (A2, AB, and Bg horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 173 centimeters (0 to 68 inches) (Ap, A1, A2, AB, Bg, and BCg horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 86 centimeters (0 to 34 inches) (Ap, A1, A2, and AB horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 86 to 173 centimeters (34 to 68 inches) (Bg and BCg horizons);
udic moisture regime.

These soils do not meet the saturation requirements of Aquolls. The morphology of the typical profile does not clearly identify an erratic organic matter decrease with depth or a content of organic matter in excess of 0.3 percent at a depth of 127 centimeters (50 inches) below the surface.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
