Kamack soils do not have an O horizon and occur on dissected mountainsides.
Longabaugh soils have secondary calcium carbonates within 24 to 64 cm (9 to 25 in) of the surface and occur on mountain slopes.
Midfork soils have very stony loam surface textures and occur on fan aprons and mountain slopes.
Piegan soils have extremely cobbly sandy loam surface textures and occur on nivation hollows on ridges, mountain slopes, and glacial-valley walls.
Sawpit soils occur at elevations between 3050 to 3475 m (10,000 to 11,400 ft) on mesa summits, alluvial fans, and along drainageways.
