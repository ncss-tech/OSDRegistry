TENDERFOOT SERIES  

The Tenderfoot series consists of shallow to hardpan, well drained soils on plateaus and mesas.  These soils formed in alluvium from cherty limestone. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Calcic Paleargids  

TYPICAL PEDON: Tenderfoot very gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine vesicular and irregular pores; surface lag of 35 percent chert and limestone gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt smooth  boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)  

    Bt--3 to 9 inches; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 10 percent chert and limestone gravel; few faint clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inches thick)  

    Bk--9 to 17 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) extremely cobbly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 40 percent cobble and 25 percent gravel of calcium carbonate-coated limestone and hardpan fragments; slightly effervescent in the fine earth and strongly effervescent on coatings; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary (7 to 9 inches thick)  

    Bkm--17 to 23 inches; indurated, calcium carbonate-cemented hardpan.  

    R--23 inches; limestone.  

TYPE LOCATION: Coconino County, Arizona; on the Havasupai Indian  Reservation; 2100 feet west and 1600 feet north of the southeast corner of Section 9, T. 32 N., R. 5 W.  

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Soil Moisture: Moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during December - March and intermittently moist during July-September.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.  

Soil Temperature: 54 to 57 degrees F.  

Rock Fragments: 35 to 65 percent gravel and cobble.  A gravelly to extremely gravelly surface lag layer is common.

Depth to Petrocalcic horizon: Dominantly 14 to 20 inches, but ranges from 10 to 20 inches  

Depth to bedrock: 16 to 40 inches  

Calcium carbonate equivalent: Less than 30 percent above the hardpan  

Organic matter: Averages more than 1 percent in the surface

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tenderfoot soils are on plateaus and mesas at elevations of 5700 to 6100 feet.  They formed in alluvium derived from cherty limestone.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 135 to 175 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Havasupai and Winona soils.  Havasupai and Winona soils do not have argillic horizons.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION: Tenderfoot soils are used for wildlife habitat, recreation and livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, blue grama, and bottlebrush squirreltail.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  This series is of moderate extent.  MLRA is 35.
