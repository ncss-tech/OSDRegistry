TROUTER SERIES

The Trouter series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over basalt. Trouter soils are in valleys. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, amorphic, mesic Humic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Trouter stony ashy loam - forested on a 2 percent east-facing slope at an elevation of 1,910 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. All textures are apparent field textures.)

 Oi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed needles, leaves, and twigs.

 A--1 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) stony ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick)

 AB--5 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

 Bw1--12 to 23 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular and common very fine tubular; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (7 to 14 inches thick)

 Bw2--23 to 30 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) ashy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic and weakly smeary; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular and few very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

 2R--30 inches; basalt.

TYPE LOCATION: Klickitat County, Washington; about 1.5 miles south of Trout Lake; 2,300 feet south and 200 feet west of the northeast corner, section 26, T. 6 N., R. 10 E. (Latitude 45 degrees, 58 minutes, 48 seconds N. and Longitude 121 degrees, 30 minutes, 27 seconds W.)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10. The particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 98 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent. Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average from 0 to 10 percent. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.
The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It has 5 to 10 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent gravel.
The Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 or 4 moist. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chemawa, Parkdale, and Pinbit (T) series.
Chemawa soils - greater than 60 inches to bedrock; dry 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice
Parkdale soils - greater than 60 inches to bedrock; dry 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice
Pinbit soils  greater than 60 inches to bedrock; dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Trouter soils are in valleys at elevations of 800 to 2,150 feet. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Trouter soils formed in volcanic ash over basalt. Summers are warm and dry; winters are cool and wet, with snow cover from December through March. The mean annual precipitation is 48 to 52 inches. The mean January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 85 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Flotag, Underwood, and Volash soils and the competing Chemawa series. Flotag soils are coarse-loamy and are on low terraces. Underwood soils are fine-loamy, have an argillic horizon and are on backslopes of mountains. Volash soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and are on plains. Chemawa soils are on terraces and backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for timber production, livestock grazing, cropland, homesites, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, with an understory of snowbrush ceanothus, Idaho fescue, elk sedge, antelope bitterbrush, and rose.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Klickitat County, Washington. MLRA 6. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Klickitat County, Washington, 2003.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Umbric epipedon - the zone from 1 to 12 inches
Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 30 inches
Lithic contact - the zone beginning at 30 inches
Andic properties - the zone from 1 to 30 inches
Particle-size control section - the zone from 1 to 30 inches
Depth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.
