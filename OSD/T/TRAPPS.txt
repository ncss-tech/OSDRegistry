TRAPPS SERIES

The Trapps series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from limestone or argillite and in glacial till.  These soils are on mountains and glacial moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 520 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Trapps gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 5 cm; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    E--5 to 30 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine pores; 25 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 38 cm thick) 

    Bt--30 to 66 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick) 

    Bk1--66 to 94 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine pores; lime coatings on underside of pebbles; 50 percent pebbles; disseminated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 38 cm thick) 

    Bk2--94 to 158 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; common very fine pores; lime coatings on underside of coarse fragments; 50 percent pebbles, 20 percent cobbles; disseminated lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).
