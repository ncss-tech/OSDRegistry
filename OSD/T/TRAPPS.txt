TRAPPS SERIES 

The Trapps series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from limestone or argillite and in till.  These soils are on mountains and moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Trapps gravelly loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--2 inches to 0; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT0539, MT1145, MT1178, MT9041. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches which is also an albic (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 10 to 24 inches (Bt horizon); a calcic horizon from 24 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle-size control section that is the argillic horizon (Bt horizon).  Trapps soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
