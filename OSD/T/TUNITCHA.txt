GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tunitcha soils are on backslopes of high plateaus, mesas and structural benches.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Tertiary sandstone. Slopes range from 45 to 60 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 60 to 90 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Akhoni, Bangston, and Klizhin soils.  Akhoni soils are shallow to sandstone.  Bangston soils lack argillic horizons, are sandy and occur on colder, north facing backslopes.  Klizhin soils are coarse-loamy and occur on footslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderate permeability 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tunitcha soils are used for timber production and limited livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is ponderosa pine and Douglas fir with an understory of Gambel oak, nodding bromegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Oregon-grape, earth sedge, and silvery lupine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Tunitcha soils are of small extent on the Defiance Upwarp-Chuska Mountains portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and northeast Arizona. MLRA 35.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Juan County (Shiprock Area Soil Survey), New Mexico, 1993.  Tunitcha is a place name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 8 inches.  (A and BA horizons) 

Mollic feature - darker colors in A and BA horizons that are too thin for a mollic epipedon. 

Argillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 38 inches.  (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons) 

Paralithic contact - The presence of soft sandstone bedrock at 57 inches. 

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Organic carbon values are estimated.
