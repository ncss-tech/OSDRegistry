TORNERO SERIES

The Tornero series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that develop on linear or curvilinear dunes on the eastern margin of playa basins on the Southern High Plains.  These soils formed in calcareous eolian sediments of Late Pleistocene to Holocene age.  Mean annual precipitation is 406 m (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F). Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.

Delphos soils: have less than 18 percent silicate clay in the particle-size control section.
Drake soils: have a superactive cation exchange activity class and are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods.
Lovington soils: have lower value and chroma in surface horizon and more calcium carbonate by weight in the control section.
Ratliff soils:  have an active cation exchange activity class and higher calcium carbonate content in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: calcareous, loamy eolian deposits of late Pleistocene to Holocene age.   
Landform: convex, linear and curvilinear dunes on the eastern margin of playa basin or salt lake basins.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kenhill (T-NM), Potter and Ratliff series. 
Kenhill soils: are on lower landscape positions and have petrocalcic horizons.
Potter soils: are on lower landscape positions and have higher calcium carbonate content and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.
Ratliff soils: are on lower landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately permeable.  Surface runoff is medium on 1 to 8 percent slopes and high on 8 to 30 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used primarily for rangeland.  Native vegetation includes mid and tall grasses with a lesser short grass component and a few woody plants.  Forbs may also occur but are not abundant.  Grasses include sideoats, blue grama, black grama, buffalograss, alkali sacaton, vine-mesquite, and small amounts of swithchgrass.  Other species include yucca, sensitivebrier, daleas, fourwing saltbrush, and cholla. This soil has been correlated to the High Lime (R077DY040TX) range site in MLRA-77D.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77D in LRR H); of eastern New Mexico. The soil is minor in extent.
