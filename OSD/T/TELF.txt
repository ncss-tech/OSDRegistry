TELF SERIES

The Telf series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock of the Lissie Formation.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on flats on coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent but mainly less than 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in).

Firstone soils: have more than 60 percent clay in the particle size control section; in the thermic temperature regime; moderately deep and formed in residuum from shale.
Midfield soils: smectitic mineralogy; have a lithologic discontinuity
Mudlavia soils: are clayey-skeletal; a superactive activity class; mesic temperature regime; formed in gravelly clayey outwash.
Nez and Telferner soils: remain saturated in the upper part long enough for oxyaquic conditions

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock
Landscape: coastal plains

Edco soils: have less than 30 cm (12 in) of surface horizon; on a similar landform but lower in the landscape
Garwood soils: have more than 51 cm (20 in) of surface horizon; on a similar landform but higher in the landscape.
Katy soils: in a fine-loamy family; are on a similar landform and similar position on the landscape.  
Nada soils: are in a fine-loamy; on a similar landform but lower in the landscape
Nez soils: are on similar landform and a similar position on the landscape positions; have savannah type vegetation.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Moderately well
Permeability class: very slow
Runoff: very high 
Flooding: None
Ponding: None
Seasonal water table: In normal years, water perches on top of the argillic horizon for short periods of time after heavy rains but saturation does not occur long enough to satisfy the oxyaquic classification requirements.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used for rice production.  Some areas are in native rangeland and improved pasture.  Native grasses are mainly species of andropogon and paspalum genera.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Colorado County, Texas; 1997.

REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Telferner series.  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.  The classification of this series was changed in 2016 during the update of MLRA 150A. The previous classification of Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs was based on a preliminary anlaysis of data from study of similar soils. A more detailed analysis of the data indicated that reduction only occurred during abnormally wet times. During normal years, these soils do not reduce or saturate long enough for oxyaquic criteria. The series classification supports mixed mineralogy and is based on reference samples tested for mineralogy by Texas A&M University. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon: 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) (A and E horizons)

Albic horizon: 23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 in) (E horizon)

Abrupt textural change: 41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 in) (Bt1 horizon)

Vertic feature: Cracks and/or wedge-shaped aggregates within the upper part of the argillic horizon.

Argillic horizon: 41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 and Bt5 horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data pending on pedons for project C2017USTX035.
