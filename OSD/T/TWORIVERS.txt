TWORIVERS SERIES

The Tworivers series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal over sandy or sandy-skele, mixed Abruptic Argiborolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tworivers gravelly loam, in native range (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 7 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine pores; 5 percent cobbles, 15 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--7 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and few very fine roots; many very fine pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent cobbles, 20 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--15 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very gravelly clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common very fine pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 20 percent cobbles, 30 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick)

    2C1--24 to 42 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 5 percent stones, 15 percent cobbles, 45 percent pebbles; strongly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.

    2C2--42 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely cobbly coarse sand, brown (10YR5/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 15 percent stones, 35 percent cobbles, 25 percent pebbles; slightly effervescent; mildly alkaline. (pH 7.6)

SERIES PROPOSED:  Sweet Grass County, Montana, 1989.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1375, MT1376.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A horizon); an argillic horizon from 7 to 24 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 7 to 40 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2C1 horizons); a sandy-skeletal discontinuity at a depth of 24 inches (2C1, 2C2 horizons).  Tworivers soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
