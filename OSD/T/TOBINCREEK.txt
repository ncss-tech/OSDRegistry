TOBINCREEK SERIES

The Tobincreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from calcareous siltstone, shale or sandstone residuum. These soils are on mountain slopes, stream terrace risers and hills. Slopes are 15 to 45 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Ustic Argicryolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Tobincreek loam, forested on a north-facing slope of 40 percent at 5,920 feet elevation. When described on September 15, 1988 the soil was slightly moist below a depth of 8 inches (colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

	Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed plant material; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 3 inches thick)

	A--2 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and many coarse roots; common very fine and fine and few medium irregular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

	Bt1--6 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; common fine and few medium and coarse irregular pores; 10 percent patchy, distinct clay films along root channels; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.

	Bt2--12 to 25 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine and medium irregular pores; 25 percent patchy, distinct clay films on vertical faces of peds and on surfaces of pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 13 to 26 inches thick)

	Cr1--25 to 44 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) semi-consolidated brittle siltstone and fine grained sandstone bedrock; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.

	R--44 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3), consolidated, very hard, very brittle siltstone and sandstone bedrock; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8);

COMPETING SERIES: 
Florissant (CO) - has a strongly cemented Bk horizon at 15 to 30 inches.

Goth (CO)  is very deep.

Gothic (CO) - is very deep.

Jerry (CO) - is very deep.

Judy (CO) - has a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

Mayoworth (WY) - has a BA horizon.

Owen Creek (WY) - has horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.

Parlin (CO) - is very deep.

Piltz (CO)  has 5 to 35 percent granite rock fragments in the argillic horizon.

Sneffels (WY)  has a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform  Mountain slopes, stream terrace risers and hills.
Elevation  5,500 to 6,500 feet
Slope  15 to 45 percent
Parent material  Calcareous siltstone, shale and sandstone
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 38 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 20 inches 
Frost-free period  50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Doby and Mayflower soils. Doby soils are shallow to a paralithic contact and are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Mayflower soils are pachic and are on hills, ridges, stream terraces, and mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for understory grazing.  Dominant natural vegetation  is Douglas fir, pinegrass, serviceberry, common snowberry, bearded wheatgrass, rose, brome, Idaho fescue, Kentucky bluegrass and some bluebunch wheatgrass.  Engelmann spruce, Rocky Mountain maple, aspen, juniper and cottonwood occupy small areas.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tobincreek soils are of small extent in south western Montana. MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana 

SERIES PROPOSED: Park County, Montana, 2005. Tobincreek soils are named after a nearby feature on the Ibex Mountain quadrangle.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Mollic epipedon  the zone from 2 to 12 inches (A and Bt1)

Argillic horizon  the zone from 6 to 25 inches (Bt1 and Bt2)
