TORPY SERIES

The Torpy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from tuffaceous volcanic rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans and sideslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Torpy gravelly loam, forested, (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inches; forest litter of partially decomposed needles and twigs.

    A--1 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    E--4 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--9 to 35 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 25 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 30 inches thick)

    BC--35 to 61 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) very cobbly loam, gray (10YR 5/1) moist; single grain; loose, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; few coarse roots; slightly acid (pH 6.5).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jefferson County, Montana, 1998.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretive record: MT1504, MT1731, MT3037.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 8 inches (A and E horizons); a cambic horizon from 8 to 34 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control from 10 to 40 inches (Bw and BC horizons).  Torpy soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Vitrandic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustivitrandic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
