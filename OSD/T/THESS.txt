THESS SERIES

The Thess series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces and basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Thess loam, native grass (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; strong fine platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; common fine pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bk1--5 to 22 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots, common fine pores; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and continuous distinct calcium carbonate coatings on surface of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 24 inches thick) 

    Bk2--22 to 34 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, consisting of thin strata of silt loam and sandy loam brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and continuous distinct calcium carbonate coatings on surface of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick) 

    2Bk3--34 to 60 inches; very gravelly sand; variegated colors; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and continuous faint calcium carbonate casts on undersides of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces and basin floors
Elevation - 3,500 to 6,700 feet
Slope - 0 to 8 percent
Parent material - alluvium 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 45 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 70 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability to 34 inches and very rapid below. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Thess soils are used mainly for irrigated hayland and grain, or dryland grain, and range.  Potential native vegetation is mainly blue grama, Sandberg bluegrass, prairie junegrass, western wheatgrass, needleandthread, fringed sagewort, broom snakeweed, and pricklypear cactus. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Thess soils are moderately extensive in central Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B.
