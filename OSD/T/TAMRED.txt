TAMRED SERIES

The Tamred series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt.  These soils are on south facing mountainsides.  Slopes are 20 to 60 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters and the average annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xerollic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tamred loam -- forested -- on a 25 percent slope at 1495 meters elevation.  Aspect is south.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on July 28, 1987, the soil was dry throughout.)

     Oi--0 to 5 cm; needles, leaves, twigs and cones.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

     A--5 to 13 cm, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3)moist; weak very fine and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

     AB--13 to 23 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) gravelly loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 25 cm thick)

    Bt--23 to 58 cm; yellowish red (5YR 4/6) extremely cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine and few coarse roots; few very fine tubular pores; very few thin clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 80 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (36 to 64 cm thick).

    R1--58 to 76 cm; fractured bedrock with many roots in cracks; cracks are more than 10 cm apart; clear irregular boundary.

    R2--76 cm; basalt

TYPE LOCATION:  Adams County, Idaho; about 3.2 km southwest of Tamarack, about 732 meters north and 107 meters west of the southeast corner of section 35, T.19N., R.1W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Average annual soil temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C.
Average summer soil temperature - 11 to 14 degrees C.
(The O horizon is thin and intermittent so is not used in classifying this soil)
Depth to bedrock - 50 to 100 cm
Coarse fragments in control section - 60 to 85 percent

A horizon
Value - 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma - 2 or 3 dry or moist

AB horizon
Texture - loam or gravelly loam
Rock fragment content - 10 to 30 percent

Bt horizon
Hue - 5YR or 2.5YR
Chroma - 4 through 6 dry or moist
Texture - extremely cobbly clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam
Rock fragment content - 60 to 85 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Buffmeyer, Condie, Guiser(T), Jonda(T), Judkins, Mulgon, Namon, Scandard(T), and Wapshilla series.  Buffmeyer, Condie, Guiser, Jonda, Mulgon, Namon, and Wapshilla soils are deeper than 100 cm to bedrock.  Judkins soils have a hue of 10YR in the argillic horizon, have E horizons,and have average annual soil temperature of less than 4 degrees C.  Scandard soils have sandy loam or sandy clay loam textures with more than 45 percent sand in the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tamred soils are on south facing mountainsides.  These soils formed in material weathered from basalt.  Slopes are 20 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 1400 to1625 meters.  The average annual precipitation is 635 to 890 millimeters.  The average annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brody, Culdesac and Tica series.  Brody and Culdesac soils have an ash mantle and 10YR or 7.5YR hues.  Culdesac soils are greater than 100 cm deep to basalt.  Tica soils are less than 50 cm deep to basalt and have 10YR hues.  These soils are on similar landscape positions with Brody and Culdesac occurring primarily on north and east aspects.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, watershed, and recreation.  Potential natural vegetation is Douglas- fir, ponderosa pine, willow, snowbrush ceanothus, low Oregon grape, and pine reedgrass.

DISTRIBUTION EXTENT:  West central Idaho.  The soil is not extensive.
