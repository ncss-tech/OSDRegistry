TUCKERVILLE SERIES 

The Tuckerville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and sandstone.  Tuckerville soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Glossocryalfs

(10 to 30 inches thick) 

    C--47 to 63 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) extremely stony sandy loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobble, 35 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gambler, Granile, Kebler, Kurrie, Larand, and Leadville series.
Gambler, Kebler, Kurrie soils: have a lithic contact within 60 inches.
Granile soils: have greater than 15 percent mica
Larand soils: have a lithologic discontinuity with sandy outwash
Leadville soils: are close competitors, but are believed to be drier in the moisture control section, and possible colder (conducive to supporting lodgepole pine, and not white fir). In addition, base saturation may be below 60 percent in the upper part.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  Slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and sandstone.
Landform:  Mountain slopes.
Slopes:  10 to 60 percent
Elevation: 8,500 to 10,000 feet
Mean annual air temperature: 36 to 42 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  25 to 35 inches.
  Wettest months:  July and August receive the most precipitation.
  Driest months:  May and June receive the least precipitation, though the soils are still wet from snowmelt and are typically covered with snow in many places into June.
Frost-free period:  60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Sponsor and Weminuche soils.  Both are on mountain slopes and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Typical native vegetation is Englemann's spruce, subalpine fir, white fir, Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, quaking aspen, fescue, mountain brome, spike tricetum, snowberry, and serviceberry (white fir-Rocky Mountain Douglas fir/mountain snowberry plant association). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of moderate extent.  The name is taken from an old mining community in the vicinity.
