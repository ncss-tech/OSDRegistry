TRINITY SERIES

The Trinity series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium derived from mudstone. These nearly level soils occur on flood plains on river valleys and large streams on dissected plains.  Slopes are typically less than 1 percent but the range is 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1193.8 mm (47 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).
