TOZE SERIES

The Toze series consists of very deep, well drained soils that were formed in slope alluvium from limestone, shale, dolomite, and sandstone.  These soils are on hillside slopes, alluvial fans and mountain plateaus. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture:  These soils are usually moist in the 4 to 12 inch depth and are dry for periods of 80 days or less in the late summer months. The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that peaks from December to March and July to October and falls evenly throughout the remainder of the year. Udic bordering ustic moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 36 to 47 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature is 52 to 58 degrees F. 
Depth to lithic contact and thickness of regolith:  greater than 60 inches
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 16 to 36 inches 

Particle-size control section (weighted averages):
  Clay content:  20 to 35 percent; 18 to 36 percent noncarbonate clay
  Fine sand and coarser sand content:  greater than 15 percent, including coarse fragments up to 7.5 mm
  Rock fragment content: 15 to 35 percent
  Texture:  silt loam or silty clay loam

A horizon:  (ABk present in some pedons)
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3
Reaction:  neutral to moderately alkaline. 

Bk horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  gravelly silty clay
Rock fragment content:  30 to 60 percent
Reaction: strongly to very strongly calcareous and slightly to strongly alkaline

Some pedons have an ABk horizon which is included as part of the calcic horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Karlan and Richvale series. Karlan soils are moderately deep.  Richvale soils do not have calcareous rock fragments in the A horizon, are 36 to 70 inches deep over sand and gravel, and have mean annual precipitation of 14 to 17 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: slope alluvium from limestone, shale, dolomite, and sandstone
Landform: hillside slopes, alluvial fans, usually in pockets, and mountain plateaus

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 79 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (parts of A3 and Bk1 horizon and all of A4 horizon)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 35 inches.  (A1, A2, A3, A4 horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 35 to 60 inches.  (Bk horizons)
Lithic contact:  The contact with hard bedrock at more than 60 inches in some pedons. 
Other features: Pachic feature:  the mollic epipedon is greater than 16 inches thick. 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

The udic moisture regime is changed to udic bordering ustic, 02/2011.

Taxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.

These soils were formerly classified in the Calcisol great soil group.
