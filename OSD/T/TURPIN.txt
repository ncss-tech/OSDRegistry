TURPIN SERIES

The Turpin series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks.  Turpin soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Sodic Xeric Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Turpin sandy clay loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 13 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; strongly effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

(8 to 30 cm thick)

    Bkn1--51 to 74 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure; slightly hard, firm, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; violently effervescent, carbonates segregated in common fine irregular seams and filaments; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 100 cm thick)

    2Bkn2--74 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; violently effervescent, carbonates are disseminated; very strongly alkaline (pH 10).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lake County, Oregon; in the Warner Valley about 11.5 miles northeast of Plush; in the SW 1/4 of the SW 1/4 of the SW 1/4 of section 28, T. 33 S., R. 26 E.; USGS Bluejoint Lake West 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; approximately latitude 42 degrees 40 minutes 36 seconds N and latitude 119 degrees 40 minutes 41 seconds W; longitude NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry for one half to three-fourths of the time from about March 15 to about November 15; The soil surface is may be saturated or ponded for brief periods in the spring; aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: Greater than 150 cm.
Other features: Sodium accumulation and salinity increases with depth.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 20 to 35 percent. Sand content: 40 to 70 percent, with greater than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.

A horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Structure: Platy or prismatic.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 10 percent.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline (up to pH 11.0).
Salinity (EC): 2 to 8 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 5 to 10.
Other features: Sand fraction is mostly very fine sand and fine sand.

Bn horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Structure: Platy or prismatic and may part to subangular blocky.
Texture: Loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 10 percent.
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline (up to pH 11.0).
Salinity (EC): 2 to 16 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 10 to 200.
Other features: Sand fraction is mostly fine sand and medium sand.

Bkn horizon, BCn horizon or C horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Texture: Sandy clay loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 2 to 10 percent.
Salinity (EC): 8 to 16 mmhos/cm.
Sodicity (SAR): 200 to 300.
Pararock fragments: 0 to 30 percent paragravel or parachanners; Pararock fragments consist of weakly cemented silty lacustrine deposits that are fractured and that do not form a horizon or layer that is root-limiting. The majority of these fragments are water-stable and will not slake after air-drying and soaking in water for at least one hour.
Other features: Sand fraction is mostly fine sand and medium sand; some pedons lack identifiable secondary carbonates; some pedons have relict redox concentrations of iron.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Turpin soils are on lake terraces.  They formed in lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks with surface mantles of eolian material.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,495 meters.  The climate is arid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Helphenstein, Mesman, Icene, and Reese soils.  Helphenstein soils have endosaturation within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Mesman soils have a natric horizon.  Icene soils have a salic horizon.  Reese soils have aquic soil conditions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained or moderately well drained; high or very high surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  One phase is susceptible to occasional ponding for brief duration with water up to 15 cm deep as well as endosaturation with an apparent seasonal high water table between 122 and 150 cm (deep free water occurrence class) from February through April.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Turpin soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is black greasewood, shadscale, spiny hopsage, and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Oregon.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon of Turpin is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE as soil survey sample number S86-OR-037-006 (pedon # 86P0992) with horizon samples no. 86P5928 to 86P5932.  This data is not from the typical pedon at the type location.
