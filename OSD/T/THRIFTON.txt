THRIFTON SERIES

The Thrifton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow to dense till. These soils formed in till and have been extensively eroded due to cultural practices. They are on moraines. Slope ranges from 6 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Oxyaquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Thrifton clay loam, on 15 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; 10 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

 BCt--20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

 Cd--36 to 203 cm (14 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; massive, ruptures to weak medium platy fragments; firm; 12 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Ross County, Ohio; about 4 miles northwest of Frankfort, in Concord Township; about 1915 feet northwest of junction of OH 138 and CR 95, along CR 95 then 860 feet north; USGS Frankfort, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 27 minutes 58 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 13 minutes 0 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the base of the argillic horizon: 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 inches)
Depth to densic contact: 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 inches)

Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: clay loam or loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures
Rock fragment content: 2 to 20 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

BCt horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 4 to 6
Texture: clay loam or loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures
Rock fragment content: 2 to 20 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Cd horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 to 5
Texture: loam or silt loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures
Rock fragment content: 2 to 20 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. In closely related families are the Losantville and Wapahani series. Losantville soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are in the clayey particle-size class. Wapahani soils are in the active cation-exchange activity class.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thrifton soils are on moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 6 to 50 percent. The soils formed in till and have been extensively eroded due to cultural practices. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Celina, Miami, and Miamian soils. Celina soils are moderately well drained and have more clay in the subsoil and are generally in less sloping positions. The moderately well drained Miami and well drained Miamian soils have carbonates at deeper depths and are on similar landscape positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately slow above the dense till and slow in the dense till.

USE AND VEGETATION: Thrifton soils are cultivated and pastured. Principal crops are corn, hay, soybeans and wheat. A few areas are reverting back to woodland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central Ohio; MLRAs 111A, 111D, and 111E. The type location is in MLRA 111A. The series is of small extent.
