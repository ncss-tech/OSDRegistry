TODDVILLE SERIES

The Toddville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loess or silty alluvium and in the underlying stratified alluvium.  These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters.  Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.
