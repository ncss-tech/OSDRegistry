COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: very poorly drained
Parent material: ash influenced loess over loamy alluvium over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits
Landform: depressions on till plains, depressions on terraces
Slopes: 0 to 20 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 20 to 35 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Iliamna and Redoubt soils. Iliamna and Redoubt soils are well drained and occur on terraces and hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the solum and high to very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for Forestry, wildlife habitat, and recreation. The native vegetation is shrubs, grass, and sparse cover of Lutz spruce.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska. The series is of small extent.
