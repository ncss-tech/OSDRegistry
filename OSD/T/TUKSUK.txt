COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: mountains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly colluvium
Elevation: 531 to 971 feet
Slope: 6 to 20 percent
Annual precipitation: 23.5 to 27.4 inches
Annual temperature: 23.0 to 24.8 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Kiglauik and Sinuktuk soils. Kiglauik soils are somewhat poorly drained, moderately deep, and occur on mountains. Sinuktuk soils are well drained, moderately deep, and occur on mountains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, very high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the soil profile and very low in the bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is willow/mixed grass-forb scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Highland-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
