TOSTON SERIES 

The Toston series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Natrustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Toston silty clay loam, rangeland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 2 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots and pores; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

    Btny1--2 to 4 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; moderate medium columnar structure parting to moderate medium platy; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common fine masses and filaments of gypsum; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. 

    Btny2--4 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) silty clay, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; streaks of organic stains on faces of some peds; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common fine masses of gypsum; slightly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick.) 

    Bknyz--8 to 16 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many fine tubular pores; common fine masses and filaments of gypsum and other salts; common fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bnyz--16 to 34 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam,    light gray (10YR 7/2) dry; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine faint brown (10YR 5/3) dry redox concentrations; disseminated lime; few to common fine masses and seams of gypsum and other salts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. 

    C--34 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) thinly stratified loam, sandy loam and loamy sand,  light gray (2.5Y 7/2) dry; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine distinct brown (10YR 5/3) dry redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
