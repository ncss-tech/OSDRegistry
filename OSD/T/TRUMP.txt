TRUMP SERIES

The Trump series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and limestone.  Trump soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

Arrowpeak, Mccadden, and Milling have a udic moisture regime.
Cheadle and Starley have an ustic moisture regime bordering udic.
Chokecherry, Clamp, Dollarhide, Jonlake, Labshaft, Topeki, and Udel have a xeric moisture regime.
Betemer, Dalys, Eyre, Irigul, Irson, Poin, Rogert, Schwacheim do not have secondary calcium carbonates.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium derived from Pennsylvanian age sandstone and limestone, commonly associated with the Belden and Minturn Formations
Landform: mountains and hills
Slopes:  5 to 25 percent
Elevation:  2743 to 2865 meters (9000 to 9400 feet)
Mean annual temperature:  1.7 to 3.9 degrees C (35 to 39 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  356 to 432 mm (11 to 15 inches)
Precipitation pattern:  Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August.
Frost-free period:  50 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Gebson soil.  Gebson soils are very deep and are on pediments and foot slopes of hills.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists mainly of Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, needlegrass, prairie Junegrass, western wheatgrass, and mountain mahogany with widely spaced bristlecone pine and ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A; small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010.  This pedon is in the adjacent Pike and San Isabel NF, Northern Part soil survey area, and is the typical pedon of the Cheadle Family in that survey. The Trump series name was reactivated in 2009 for use in the Teller-Park soil survey. This series was originally established in 1959 in Chaffee County, Colorado, in the Trout Creek Watershed Area, which is now a part of the soil survey of Pike and San Isabel National Forests, Northern Part. The name is from a townsite in Park County. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 43 cm (0 to 17 inches).
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 43 cm.  (A2, Bk horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  from 0 to 23 cm.  (A1, A2 horizons)
Cambic horizon and accumulations of secondary carbonates: from 23 to 43 cm. (Bk horizon)
Lithic contact:  The contact with limestone at 43 cm.  (R layer)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
