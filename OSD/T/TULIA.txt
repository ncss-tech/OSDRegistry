TULIA SERIES

The Tulia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous eolian sediments derived mainly from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on very gently to strongly sloping plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 48 cm (18 in.) and the mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Estacado, Mansker, and Posey series, and the Acuff, Amarillo, Berda, Olton, Potter, and Pullman series. 
Estacado, Mansker, and Posey soils are on similar landscape positions. 
Acuff and Amarillo soils are on slightly higher landscape positions have mixed soil mineralogy, and the depth to a calcic horizon is between 76 and 152 cm (30 to 60 in). 
Berda soils are on lower landscape positions and have mixed soil mineralogy and a cambic horizon. 
Olton and Pullman soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have mixed soil mineralogy and a mollic epipedon. 
Potter soils are on slightly lower landscape positions and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability; surface runoff is low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 12 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Primarily used for rangeland. Where cultivated, the principal crops are grain sorghum, small grains, and forage crops. Climax vegetation is mainly mid and short grasses and includes blue grama, sideoats grama, and buffalograss, with lesser amounts of vine-mesquite, western wheatgrass, galleta or tobosa, silver bluestem, wild alfalfa, and prairie clover with a light to moderate overstory of mesquite. This soil has been correlated to the Limy Upland (R077CY022TX) range site in MLRA-77C. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains of Texas (MLRA 77C in LRR H). The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Swisher County, Texas; 1970. 

REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Posey and Mansker series. After review of the lab data, the taxonomic family particle-size class was changed from fine-loamy to coarse-loamy in 2022. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in) (A horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 43 to 203 cm (17 to 80 in) (Btkk, Btk, and 2Btk horizons)
