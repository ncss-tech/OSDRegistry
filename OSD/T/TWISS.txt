TWISS SERIES

The Twiss series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks. These soils are on floodplain steps. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Twiss silt loam on irrigated hayland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 10 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine and common medium tubular pores; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 12 cm thick)

 Bw1--10 to 25 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; many very fine and fine and common medium roots; many very fine and fine and common medium tubular pores; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

 Bw2--25 to 43 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine and common medium tubular pores; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 30 to 60 cm)

 C1--43 to 57 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine, fine and medium pores; 10 percent gravel; 10 percent common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 centimeters thick).

 C2--57 to 200 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; single grain; loose, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; 70 percent gravel; 10 percent common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
