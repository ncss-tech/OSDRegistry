MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES PROPOSED: Iredell County; North Carolina, 2003

REMARKS: Turnersburg soils were previously mapped as Mocksville soils. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Turnersburg series as a mesic counterpart.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 6 to 31 inches (Bt and BC horizon)

Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: Reference data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory; pedon numbers S03NC-097-012, S03NC-097-013, and S03NC-097-014.
