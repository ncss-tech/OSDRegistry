TORCHSPRINGS SERIES

The Torchsprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils on benches, toeslopes and valley floors of glaciated mountains.  These soils are formed in volcanic ash overlying loess and colluvium over till from mixed rock types.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, frigid Alfic Vitrixerands 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Torchsprings ashy silt loam, woodland, on an 11 percent southwest-facing slope at an elevation of 3,890 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)
