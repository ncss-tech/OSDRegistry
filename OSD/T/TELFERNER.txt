TELFERNER SERIES

The Telferner series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on ancient meander ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent but are usually less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Calhoun County, Texas; 1972.

REMARKS: The classification was changed from Typic Albaqualfs to Albaquic Hapludalfs based on the soil moisture "ISCOM VIII, Classification and Management of Wet Soils, 1990." During the correlation of Colorado County, Texas, the classification was changed from Albaquic Hapludalfs to Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs. This classification was based on a 1996 field study of wet clay pan soils of the Gulf Coast Prairie and Claypan Prairie.  This study concluded that significant iron reduction and depletion occurs in the A and E horizons and, to a lesser extent, within the upper 25 cm (10 in) of the argillic horizon.  However, the long term monitoring of these soils does not support aquic conditions in normal years.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon:  0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in) (A and E horizons)

Albic horizon:  28 to 38 cm (11 to 15 in) (E horizon)

Vertic feature: Cracks and slickensides within the upper part of the argillic horizon.  

Argillic horizon:  38 to 203 cm (15 to 80 in) (Bt horizons)
