TINYBAUGH SERIES

The Tinybaugh series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from granite over residuum weathered from granite. The Tinybaugh soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1070 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Lithic Humixerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Tinybaugh very gravelly loamy sand on a southeast facing (140 degree), 36 percent slope under greenleaf manzanita and incense cedar at an elevation of 2089 meters. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted. When described on May 19, 2015 the soil was moist throughout.)

 Oe--0 to 3 cm; moderately decomposed plant material, black (10YR 2/1) moist; about 40 percent fiber, 20 percent rubbed; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 5 cm thick)

 A1--3 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loamy sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; 4 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 35 percent rounded indurated granite fine gravel; NaF pH 10.5; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.

 A2--25 to 40 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely stony loamy sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; 5 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky, nonplastic; common very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots around fragments; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 20 percent subrounded indurated granite gravel, 20 percent subangular indurated granite flagstones, 30 percent subangular indurated granite stones; NaF pH 11.0; strongly acid (pH 5.2); very abrupt smooth boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons is 5 to 40 cm)

 R--40 cm; Indurated granite bedrock, fractured at intervals of =>200 cm; common fine, medium, and coarse roots top of horizon.

TYPE LOCATION: Tulare County, California, near Suwanee Creek;  USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle: Giant Forest, California;  WGS84 36.603806 latitude and -118.799988 longitude;  UTM zone 11 4052430 meters N 339010 meters E NAD83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 cm is 6 to 12 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is greater than 6 degrees C. The soils have a mesic temperature regime.

Soil moisture: The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about June to October (about 150 days).

Diagnostic Feature(s):
  Umbric epipedon thickness:  18 to 50 cm
  Depth to lithic contact:  25 to 50 cm

Organic matter: 1 to 6 percent in the epipedon

Reaction: strongly to slightly acid

Base saturation: less than 50 percent (by ammonium acetate)

Acid-oxalate extractable Al plus 1/2 Fe:  0.4 to 1.0 percent (by weight) to a depth of 50 cm.

Volcanic glass:  5 to 30 percent in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction in an 18 cm thick layer

Particle size control section weighted average:
  Rock fragments: 35 to 75 percent, with 15 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 35 percent cobbles, 0 to 20 percent stones, 0 to 25 percent channers, and 0 to 25 percent flagstones.
  Clay content: 1 to 10 percent
  NaF pH: 9.0 to 12.0


A horizon(s)
  Hue: 10YR

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tinybaugh soils are on linear to convex backslopes of structural benches and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum weathered from granite and granodiorite. Elevation is 1215 to 2540 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 800 to 1170 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free season is 105 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canyonview and Tharpslog soils. The Canyonview soils are on linear to convex backslopes of mountain slopes and do not have a lithic contact. The Tharpslog soils are on concave backslopes of mountain slopes, do not have a lithic contact, and are sandy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is greenleaf manzanita, incense cedar, black oak, and ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are of limited extent.
