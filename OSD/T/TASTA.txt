GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bartell, Centuu, Cirquecreek, Hungryhollow, Ironcreek, Klute, and Townlake soils.
Bartell are poorly drained, have a histic epipedon, and occur on drainage ways and stream terraces.
Centuu soils lack a gravelly modifier in the A horizons and occur on river valleys and alluvial fans with slopes under 20%.
Cirquecreek soils have a cambic horizon and occur on saddles and mountain slopes
Hungryhollow soils are poorly drained permafrost soils, have a sapric horizon, have mineral soil starting between 52 and 73 cm (21 and 29 in) deep, and occur on depressions in interior valleys.
Ironcreek soils are well drained, and occur in river valleys and flood plains.
Klute soils are moderately well drained or well drained, have stratified materials in the C horizons, and occur on low stream terraces and floodplains.
Townlake soils are moderately well drained, have permafrost, have folistic and mollic epipedons, have cryoturbation, and occur on hills, mountain slopes, and river valleys.
