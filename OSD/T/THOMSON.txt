MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES PROPOSED: Chester County, South Carolina, 2005.  
. 
REMARKS:  Thomson soils were previously mapped as Molena Variant (SIR SC0092)

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:
a. Ochric epipedon -the zone between 0 and 9 inches (Ap horizon). 
b. Argillic horizon -the zone between 9 and 30 inches (Bt horizon) and between 59 and 80 inches (2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons). 

MLRA=136

REVISED=12/2030/05, DTA.  This revision changed the taxonomic classification from coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludult based on lab data. 10-06-DTA-This revision changes the location to a more typical site, within the same map unit, and extends the description to 80 inches.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data from typical pedon and supporting pedons S04SC-023(1-3), Data may be obtained from Clemson University.
