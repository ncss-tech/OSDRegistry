SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: South Carolina, and possibly Georgia and North Carolina
Extent: Small

SERIES PROPOSED: Chester County, South Carolina, 2005.

REMARKS: Thomson soils were previously mapped as Molena Variant (SIR SC0092)
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches) (Ap horizon).
Argillic horizon--the zone from 23 to 76 centimeters (9 to 30 inches) (Bt horizon) and between 150 to 203 centimeters (59 to 80 inches) (2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons).

REVISED=12/20/05, DTA. This revision changed the taxonomic classification from coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Hapludult based on lab data. 10/06
DTA-This revision changes the location to a more typical site, within the same map unit, and extends the description to 203 centimeters (80 inches).  The January 2026 revision updated the format.  No data was changed.  Molena Variant in Chester County is now named Thomson.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data from typical pedon and supporting pedons S04SC-023(1-3), Data may be obtained from Clemson University.
