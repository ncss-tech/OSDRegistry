TAVARES SERIES

The Tavares series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy marine or eolian deposits.  Tavares soils are on hills, ridges and knolls of the lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Hyperthermic, uncoated Typic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Tavares sand, in a cultivated field, (Colors are for moist soil) 

 Ap--0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sand; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; common uncoated light gray (10YR 7/1) sand grains; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [8 to 28 centimeters (3 to 11 inches) thick] 

 C1--18 to 64 centimeters (7 to 25 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand; single grain; loose; common fine roots; common very fine carbon particles; many uncoated sand grains; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

 C2-- 64 to 86 centimeters (25 to 34 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose; few fine roots; many uncoated sand grains; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

 C3--86 to 155 centimeters (34 to 61 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand; single grain; loose; many uncoated sand grains; few medium faint yellow (10YR 7/6) masses of organic matter accumulation; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 C4--155 to 251 centimeters (61 to 99 inches); very pale brown (10YR 8/2) sand; single grain; loose; many uncoated sand grains; common medium faint very pale brown (10YR 7/3) masses of organic matter accumulation; strongly acid. [8 to 251 centimeters (3 to 99 inches), combined thickness)]

COMPETING SERIES: 
These are the Archbold, Astatula, Palm Beach, and St. Lucie series. 
Archbold soils are well drained and on higher positions. 
Astatula and St. Lucie are excessively drained and are on higher positions. 
Palm Beach soils are well to excessively drained and are on dunes parallel to the coast. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Tavares soils are on the lower slopes of hills, ridges and knolls within the lower Coastal Plain.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are Astatula, St. Lucie, Adamsville, Apopka, Candler, Immokalee, Lake, Myakka, Orlando, Placid, Pompano, Satellite, Sellers and Cassia series. 
Adamsville and Satellite soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on similar positions. 
Apopka soils are well drained, on higher positions, have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 102 to 203 centimeters (40 to 80 inches) in thickness, and are underlain by argillic horizons. 
Candler soils are excessively drained, on higher positions and have discontinuous lamellae around 102 to 203 centimeters (40 to 80 inches) below the surface. 
Immokalee and Myakka soils are poorly and very poorly drained, they are on flats and in depressions and have spodic horizons.
Lake soils are excessively drained, on higher positions and have more than 5 percent silt plus clay between 25 to 102 centimeters (10 and 40 inches). 
Orlando soils are well drained, on higher positions and have umbric epipedons. 
Placid and Sellers soils are very poorly drained, on lower positions and have umbric epipedons. 
Pompano soils are very poorly drained and are on lower positions. 
Cassia soils are in similar positions to those of Tavares soils, are somewhat poorly drained and have spodic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Moderately well drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): very high to high
Permeability: rapid to very rapid 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) for cemented substratum: moderately low
Permeability for cemented substratum: slow to very slow
Surface runoff: negligible
Depth to seasonal high water table: The water table is between depths of 106 to 183 centimeters (42 to 72 inches) for more than 6 to 10 months during most years but recedes to depths greater than 183 centimeters (72 inches) during periods of drought. 
Flooding frequency and duration: None applicable
Ponding frequency and duration: None applicable 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Some areas of Tavares soils are used for citrus. A few areas are used for corn, vegetable crops, watermelons, and improved pasture. In most places the natural vegetation consists of slash pine, longleaf pine, a few scattered blackjack oak, turkey oak, and post oak with an undercover of pineland threeawn. In some places natural vegetation consists of turkey oak, blackjack oak, and post oak with scattered slash pine and longleaf pine. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA): This soil mainly occurs in South Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 154). It also occurs in moderate extent in Southern Florida Flatwoods (MLRA 155), along with small portions in Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152A), the Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 153A), and the North Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 138).
Extent: Lower Coastal Plain, the series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: 
Lake County, Florida; 1970.

REMARKS: 
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 centimeters [7 inches (Ap horizon)] 

Tavares soils were formerly mapped as a low phase of the Blanton series. 

Soil Series was classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.
