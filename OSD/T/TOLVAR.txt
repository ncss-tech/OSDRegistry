TOLVAR SERIES

The Tolvar series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks and slope alluvium over colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist. Tolvar soils are on moderately to steeply sloping mountain slopes, toeslopes, footslopes, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 3 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and means annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustollic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tolvar gravelly sandy loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 inches; slightly decomposed organic material, principally needles, bark, and twigs.

    Oe--3 to 4 inches; moderately decomposed organic material, principally needles, bark, and twigs.

    A--4 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong medium granular structure; soft, very friable; 15 percent fine granite gravel; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 4 inches thick)

    E--6 to 18 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure that parts to strong medium granular; soft, very friable; 30 percent fine granitic gravel; moderately acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (4 to 16 inches thick)

    E/B--18 to 25 inches; mixed light gray (10YR 7/2) and reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable; few faint clay films on faces of peds; this horizon consists of clayey material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a lighter colored matrix like that of the overlying horizon; 40 percent fine granite gravel; slightly acid; gradual irregular boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt1--25 to 44 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very friable; common distinct clay films on vertical faces of peds; 50 percent angular granitic gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 inches thick)

    Bt2--44 to 50 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; extremely hard, very friable; common distinct clay films on vertical faces of peds; 50 percent granite gravel; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 1025 inches thick)

    C--50 to 64 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, very friable; 50 percent angular granitic gravel and 5 percent stones; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landforms:  mountain slopes and alluvial fans at relatively high elevations
Slope:  3 to 70 percent.
Elevation:  8,500 to 12,000 feet (2,591 to 3,658 meters).
Mean annual air temperature:  33 to 41 degrees F (to degrees C).
Mean annual precipitation:  16 to 30 inches (406 to 762 millimeters).
Precipitation pattern:  The soil moisture control section is affected by snow melt in early spring and peak precipitation occurring as thunderstorms from June to September.
