TERMINAL SERIES

The Terminal series consists of shallow to a duripan, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Terminal soils are on lake plains and low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Terminal soils are on lake plains and low lake terraces.  These soils formed in calcareous lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,250 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is about 70 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 160 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Jordan, Lasil, and Decker soils.  Jordan soils are fine textured, very deep, and have salic horizons.  Lasil soils are fine-silty and very deep.  Decker soils are fine-loamy and very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability (moderately low or moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity) above the duripan.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.0 and 3.5 feet (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Terminal soils are used mainly for rangeland and pasture.  The vegetation is black greasewood, pickleweed, and inland saltgrass, with abundant growth of annuals, such as pepperweed, cheatgrass, and Eriogonum.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Utah.  These soils are not extensive with about 3,250 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 28A.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Albic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (E1 and E2 horizons).

Natric horizon - The zone from 9 to 14 inches (Btkn1 and Btkn2 horizons).

Duripan - The zone from 14 to 16 inches (Bkqm horizon).

Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 24 and 42 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the C1, 2C2, and 3C3 horizons).

Particle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 14 inches (E1, E2, Btkn1, and Btkn2 horizons). 


This revision of November 2005 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Petrocalcic Natrustalfs and moves the type location from Davis to Salt Lake County, Utah.  Terminal soils in Davis County are correlated to the Croy series.  The cemented horizon in this soil is reinterpreted to be a duripan since silica is the dominant cementing agent and the horizon is otherwise too thin to be a petrocalcic horizon.  The soil moisture regime is assumed to be xeric instead of ustic.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 124-125, Table 7 of the Soil Survey of Salt Lake Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.
