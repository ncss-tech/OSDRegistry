TECUYA SERIES 

The Tecuya series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from calcareous sandstone, shale, and/or conglomerate. These soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 254 mm (10 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C (62 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tecuya soils are on hillslopes. Slope is 9 to 50 percent. The Tecuya soils formed in residuum derived from calcareous sandstone, shale, and/or conglomerate. Elevations are 412 to 1,476 meters (1,350 to 4,840 feet). The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 203 to 254 mm (8 to 10 in). The mean annual temperature is 16 to 18 degrees C (61 to 64 degrees F). Mean July temperature is about 79 degrees F, and mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C (43 degrees F). Frost-free season ranges from 200 to 300 days.

Balcom soils, on hills, are moderately deep and have a fine-loamy particle-size class. Balhud soils, on hillslopes, are shallow, have an argillic horizon, and have a fine-loamy particle-size class. Beam soils, on hills and mountains, are shallow, have a cambic horizon, and have a loamy particle-size class. Bitcreek soils, on hillslopes, have an argillic horizon, have a pachic epipedon, and have a fine-loamy particle-size class. Geghus soils, on hillslopes and mountain slopes, have an argillic horizon and have a fine-loamy particle-size class. Harrisranch soils, on mountain slopes, have a coarse-loamy particle-size class, have a pachic (thick) mollic epipedon, and have a mesic temperature regime. Loslobos soils, on hills and mountain slopes, have a pachic (thick) mollic epipedon and have a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Shimmon soils, on hills and mountains, are moderately deep, have an argillic horizon, and have a fine-loamy particle-size class.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing. Vegetation is ripgut brome, fiddleneck, redstem filaree, wild oats, soft chess and annual forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Transverse Range and associated hills of Sierra Nevada Foothills (MLRA 18). The series is not extensive.
