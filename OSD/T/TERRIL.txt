TERRIL SERIES

The Terril series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium. These soils are on base slopes, foot slopes, drainageways, swales and toe slopes on alluvial fans, and treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 875 millimeters.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 25 to 100 centimeters (A1, A2, A3, A4, and Bw1 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, A3, A4, Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 91 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, A3, and A4 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 91 to 152 centimeters (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons);
udic moisture regime.

A firm till substratum phase is recognized in MLRA 103 on the Coteau Slope (bench) physiographic area.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.
