TABLEROCK SERIES

The Tablerock series consists of deep, moderately well drained
soils that formed in colluvium weathered from basalt, andesite,
and sandstone.  Tablerock soils are on hillslopes and alluvial
fans and have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual
precipitation is about 23 inches.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Oregon; approximately 2,400 feet
west and 200 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 4, T. 36
S., R 2 W. W.M.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTIC:  These soils are usually moist but are
dry in the moisture control section for 80 to 110 consecutive
days during the period of four months following the summer
solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to weathered bedrock is over 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay with
35 to 60 percent rock fragments, primarily cobble-size.  The
mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3
moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
It has 15 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid or neutral.

The Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 2.5Y, value
of 3 or 4 moist and 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6
moist and dry.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 15 to 40
percent cobbles and stones.  It is moderately acid or slightly
acid.

The lower part of the Bt horizon and the BCt horizon has hue of
10YR and 2.5Y, and value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel
and 5 to 20 percent cobbles and stones.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam or very cobbly clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gurdane, Mallory and Thiessen series.  All of the above series are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tablerock soils are on side slopes and upper footslopes at elevations of 1,250 to 3,600 feet.  These soils
formed in colluvium weathered from basalt, andesite, and
sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches.
The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The
frost-free period is 120 to 180 days.  Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Carney soil.  The Carney soils are 20 to 40 inches deep and have less than 35
percent rock fragments in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium to
rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, and wildlife.  Native vegetation includes an
overstory of Oregon white oak, California black oak, Pacific
madrone, birchleaf mountainmahogany, ponderosa pine, Douglas fir,
and sugar pine.  Understory includes poison oak, wedgeleaf
ceanothus, bedstraw, and fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Oregon.  The series is inextensive.
