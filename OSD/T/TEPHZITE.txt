TEPHZITE SERIES

The Tephzite series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rock such as quartzite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Tephzite soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tephzite soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rocks such as quartzite or slate with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,135 to 2,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hardteph and Quartzhill soils.  Hardteph soils are ashy-skeletal and shallow to lithic contacts.  Quartzhill soils are shallow to paralithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high or very high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tephzite soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, western needlegrass, basin wildrye, currant, and prairie junegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern California, in the western part of the Great Basin.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
