TREATY SERIES

The Treaty series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying loamy till. The Treaty soils are in depressions on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Treaty silty clay loam, on a linear slope of less than 1 percent in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 248 meters (815 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

[Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 36 to 76 cm (14 to 30 inches).]

 2Btg3--91 to 150 cm (36 to 59 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 5 percent rock fragments; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [25 to 64 cm (10 to 25 inches) thick]

 2C--150 to 178 cm (59 to 70 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; massive; firm; common medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions in the matrix; 5 percent rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Cald, Cyclone, Gabriel, Luray, Mahalaland, Mahalasville, and Ragsdale series. Cald soils have a mollic epipedon that is thicker than 46 cm (18 inches). Cyclone and Ragsdale soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) to horizons containing rock fragments. Gabriel soils are more than 165 cm (65 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Luray soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Mahalaland soils have more than 60 percent sand and more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Mahalasville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section with textures than have more than 60 percent sand.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Treaty soils are in depressions on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Crosby and Fincastle soils; the moderately well drained Miami, Williamstown, and Xenia soils; and the well drained Miamian and Russell soils. These soils do not have mollic epipedons and are on higher positions on till plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface from December to March in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, wheat, and hay. A few areas are used to grow tomatoes, field beans, and other specialty crops. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Indiana and southwestern Ohio; MLRAs 110, 111A, and 111D. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of moderate extent.
