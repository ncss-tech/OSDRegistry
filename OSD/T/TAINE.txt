TAINE SERIES

The Taine series consists of shallow and very shallow well drained soils that formed in alluvium from basalt.  Taine soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 12 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Lithic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Taine extremely cobbly loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).The surface is covered with 45 percent cobble and 20 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) extremely cobbly loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; common fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; noneffervescent; 45 percent cobble, 20 percent gravel and 1 percent stone; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 5 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) extremely cobbly clay loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; noneffervescent; 45 percent cobble, 20 percent gravel and 1 percent stone; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bt2--5 to 11 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) extremely cobbly clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; strong fine prismatic structure parting to strong fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on ped faces and lining pores; noneffervescent; 45 percent cobble, 20 percent gravel and 1 percent stone; slightly alkaline (pH7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt3--11 to 15 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) extremely flaggy clay, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay skins on ped faces and lining pores; noneffervescent; 90 percent flagstone and cobble; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

    2R--15 inches; basalt.

TYPE LOCATION: Mohave County, Arizona; 5.5 miles south and .5 miles east of Truxton.  35 degrees, 24 minutes, 25 seconds north latitude, and 113 degrees, 32 minutes, 59 seconds west longitude; about 2,500 feet west and 2,100 feet north of the southeast corner of section 3 T. 23 N., R. 12 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Moist in the epipedon less than 3 months cumulative.  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: 54 to 57 degrees F.

Rock Fragments: 35 to 75 percent in the particle-size control section as basalt cobble, flagstone, gravel and stone

Clay content: averages 35 to 45 percent in the particle size control section

Depth to bedrock: 4 to 20 inches

Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline

A horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Taine soils are on hills and mountains at elevations of 4,000 to 5,200 feet.  They formed in alluvium from basalt.  Slopes range from 12 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 52 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 230 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Birdsbeak, Milok and Pastern soils.  Birdsbeak soils are less than 20 inches to a paralithic contact.  Milok soils are very deep.  Pastern soils are shallow to a hardpan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Taine soils are used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and recreation.  Vegetation is Utah juniper and singleleaf pinyon with an understory of banana yucca, broom snakeweed, sideoats grama, galleta, slim tridens, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  This series is moderately extensive.  MLRA is 38.
