TILLOU SERIES

The Tillou series consist of deep, somewhat poorly drained,
slowly permeable soils that formed in loess over loamy Southern Coastal Plains sediments.  These soils are on broad, level to
gently sloping upland terraces.  Slope is dominantly less than 2 percent, but ranges up to 5 percent.  Water runs off the surface
at a slow rate.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Glossudalfs

centimeters in diameter; ped interiors interspersed with silt; strongly acid; abrupt irregular boundary.  (6 to 16 inches thick).

     B'23t--40 to 48 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; common
very fine pores; thin patchy clay films on peds and in pores; few fine and medium black and brown concretions; few thin silt coats

TYPE LOCATION:  Morehouse Parish, Louisiana; about 16 miles
northeast of Bastrop in the SW1/4NE1/4, sec. 9, T. 23 N., R. 7 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the loamy Southern Coastal
Plain sediment ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Solum thickness
ranges from about 60 to over 100 inches.  The reaction of the A,
B&A, and B21t horizons ranges from medium acid to very strongly
acid, except for surface layers where limed.  The reaction of the B22t and lower horizons ranges from strongly acid to mildly
alkaline.  The effective CEC of the control section is 50 percent
or more saturated with exchangeable aluminum to a depth of 30
inches or more.

The A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2
or 4.

The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4
to 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Texture
is silt loam or silty clay loam.

The B&A and A&B horizons have B parts with the same color and
texture range as the above B2t horizon.  The A part has hue of
10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.

The B'2t horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of
4 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, brown, or red.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Egypt and Fred series of the same family and the Calloway, Duralde, Frizzell, Metcalf, Necessity,
and Pooleville series is similar families.  Egypt soils lack Bt horizon above the B&A horizon.  Fred soils have alkaline B
horizons.  Calloway and Necessity soils have fragipans.  Duralde
and Pooleville soils lack Bt horizons and have siliceous sand mineralogy.  Frizzell soils have coarse silty control sections.  Metcalf soils have clay lower B horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tillou soils are on level to gently sloping terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in a mantle of loess over Southern Coastal Plain sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66
degrees F near the type location.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Guyton and Providence series as well as the competing Frizzell series.
Guyton soils, on concave parts of the landscape and along drainageways, are poorly drained.  Providence soils, at slightly higher elevations, are better drained and have a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Tillou soils are somewhat poorly
drained; runoff is slow and permeability is slow.  An apparent
water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 2.5 feet during late winter
and early spring.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Louisiana and possibly Arkansas.  The series is inextensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Morehouse Parish, Louisiana; 1981.

REMARKS:  Tillou soils were formerly included with the Calloway series in mapping.  In addition to lacking a fragipan they differ from the Calloway series by having significantly lower yields for most commonly grown crops.  This is due to high levels of exchangeable aluminum in the control section.
