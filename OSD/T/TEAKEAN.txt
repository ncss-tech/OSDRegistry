TEAKEAN SERIES 

The Teakean series consists of deep to a fragipan, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess and material from gneiss and schist.  Teakean soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 10 to 50 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to 42 inches and low below this depth.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teakean soils are on mountain slopes and ridges at elevations of 1,600 to 4,300 feet (488 to 1311 meters).  The slope range is 10 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in loess and material weathered from gneiss and schist rock.  The average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 to 40 inches (635 to 1016 mm) and the frost-free season is about 80 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Crumarine, Dworshak, Kauder, Kruse, and Hugus series.  Crumarine soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in drainageways.  Kauder soils have a volcanic ash mantle and a fragipan and are on hills.  Dworshak and Hugus soils have a volcanic ash mantle, a udic moisture regime and are on mountain sideslopes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained.  Runoff is rapid or very rapid.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to 42 inches and low below this depth.  Typically, a perched water table occurs at a depth of 22 to 28 inches from December through April, but can occur at a depth of 22 to 40 inches from November to mid-May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is used primarily for timber production, livestock grazing, wildlife habitat and watershed.  Some areas have been cleared for cultivation.  The natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, creambush oceanspray, mallow ninebark, common snowberry, 
heartleaf arnica and elk sedge. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central, Idaho.  Teakean soils are not extensive. MLRA 43A.
