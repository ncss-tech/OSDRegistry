TUSSY SERIES

The Tussy series consists of moderately deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from
calcareous shale of Permian age.  These very gently sloping to
steep upland soils are on convex summits and side slopes in the
Grand Prairie.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 63
degrees F.
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Vertic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tussy clay--on a convex 7 percent slopes, in rangeland.
               (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise
stated.)

   A1--0 to 4 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong coarse granular structure; hard,
firm; many fine roots; cracks 5 to 10 mm wide; few angular chert fragments less than 76 mm in diameter; about 10 percent by volume
of soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate from 2 to 10
mm in diameter; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

   A2--4 to 8 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) silty clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; strong coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine roots; cracks 5 to 10 mm wide;
about 15 percent by volume of soft bodies and concretions of
calcium carbonate from 5 to 10 mm in diameter; calcareous;
moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 16 inches
thick)

   Bw--8 to 32 inches; reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) silty clay,
reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular
blocky structure; hard, firm; few fine roots; cracks 5 to 10 mm
wide; about 30 percent by volume of soft bodies and concretions
of calcium carbonate from 5 to 15 mm in diameter; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual irregular boundary.  (8 to 24 inches thick)

   C--32 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) and pale olive
(5Y 6/3) silty clay loam; massive; 60 percent by volume of soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate from 2 to 35 mm in diameter; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Garvin County, Oklahoma; about 10 miles east and
1 mile north of Wynnewood; 3,100 feet west and 150 feet north of
the southeast corner of sec. 4, T. 2 N., R. 3 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  This soil has cracks during the summer months that are 5
to 15 mm wide and at least 20 inches in length at a depth of 20 inches and has a potential linear extensibility of more than 60
mm and has a COLE of 0.07 or more in the A and Bw horizons that
is more than 20 inches thick.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and
chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay, silty clay loam, or clay
loam.  Coarse fragments less than 76 mm in diameter range from 0
to 20 percent by volume.  Reaction is mildly or moderately
alkaline.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma
of 3 to 6.  Texture is clay or silty clay with a clay content
that ranges from 40 to 50 percent.  Soft bodies and concretions
of calcium carbonate range from 10 to 50 percent by volume.  Concretion of calcium carbonate less than 76 mm in diameter
ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume and those more than 76 mm
in diameter ranges from 0 to 2 percent by volume.  Soft bodies of calcium carbonate range from 10 to 40 percent by volume.  Slickensides range from none to common.

The C horizon has hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma
of 3 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay, or shaly clay.
Soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate range from 25 to
75 percent by volume.  Concretions of calcium carbonate less than
76 mm in diameter ranges from 10 to 35 percent by volume and
those more than 76 mm in diameter ranges from 5 to 15 percent by volume.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is Ellis series in the same family.
Soils in similar families are Denton, Grainola, Krum, Mangum,
Matoy, Mosheim, Normangee, Owens, Steedman, Throck, and Vernon series.  Ellis soils have a cambic horizon with hue of 10YR or yellower.  Denton, Krum, Matoy, and Mosheim soils have mollic epipedons.  In addition, Denton and Mosheim soils have a calcic horizon.  Grainola, Normangee, and Steedman soils have argillic horizons.  In addition, Grainola soils have mixed mineralogy.  Mangum, Owens, Throck, and Vernon soils have mixed mineralogy.
In addition, Mangum soils have irregular distribution of organic matter within 50 inches of the soils surface, Owens soils have a solum less than 20 inches thick, Throck and Vernon soils have a
COLE less than 0.07, and Throck soils have a cambic horizon with
hue of 10YR or yellower.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tussy soils are on very gently sloping to
steep convex summits and side slopes of uplands in the Grand
Prairie.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  They formed in calcareous shale of Permian age.  The climate is moist-subhumid.  Mean
annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual
P-E indices range from 54 to 64.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Burleson, Chigley, Clarita, and Durant soils.  Burleson, Chigley, and Durant soils
have argillic horizons, have a solum more than 40 inches thick,
and are on slightly higher areas.  Clarita soils have A horizons
with chroma of 1 or less that are more than 12 inches thick, are cyclic, and occur on slightly higher summit areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly used as rangeland.  Native vegetation
is mainly short and midgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Grand Prairie of Oklahoma.  The series
is of minor extent.
