TRENTON SERIES

The Trenton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite.  The Trenton soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains, and lake terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Natrixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Trenton silty clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes - dry-farmed (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: Usually moist, moist winter, spring and fall, dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days or longer between July and October. Xeric soil moisture regime. Seasonal high water table - dominantly at depths below 30 inches.
Soil temperature: 47 to 53 degrees F.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 8 to 16 inches, may include the upper part of the natric horizon.
Depth to secondary carbonate: 12 to 40 inches, most commonly in the lower Bt horizon.
Depth to the base of the natric horizon: 24 to 46 inches.

Control section:
Texture: Silty clay or silty clay loam.
Clay content: Averages 35 to 60 percent.

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR.
Value: 2.5 to 3.5 moist and 4 to 5.5 dry.
Chroma: 1.5 to 3.
Organic matter content: 1.5 to 3.5 percent. 
Effervescence: Slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent. 


Btn and Btnk horizons:

Value: 3 to 6 moist and 4 to 8 dry.
Chroma: 2 to 4.
Texture: Silty clay or silty clay loam.
Clay content: Averages 35 to 60 percent in the upper 20 inches or the entire horizon if less than 20 inches thick; subhorizons range from 27 to 35 percent in some pedons.
Effervescence: Moderately to strongly calcareous. 
Exchangeable sodium: 14 to 50 percent.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 3 to 40 percent.

C horizon (when present):
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 to 8 dry and 3 to 6 moist.
Chroma: 2 to 4.
Texture: Silty clay to sandy loam.

COMPETING SERIES:
Spofmor (WA) soils lack mottles and aren't effervescent to the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Trenton soils occur on smooth to strongly undulating, nearly level to steep alluvial flats, lake plains, and lake terraces. Dominant slopes are 0 to 3 percent, but slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils have formed in fine textured lacustrine sediments derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite, but include materials from many other kinds of rock. The climate is dry subhumid; winters are cold and summers warm.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F., the average summer temperature from 65 to 72 degrees F., and the freeze-free season from 120 to 160 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  Elevation is 4200 to 4800 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are in the Airport, Payson, Leland, Warm Springs, Harrisville, and Parleys series. Both Warm Springs and Parleys soils lack natric horizons. The other associated soils are listed as competing series.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly and moderately well drained. Runoff is medium to rapid. Permeability is slow or very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for dryland alfalfa and small grains.  Some areas are used for irrigated sugar beets, alfalfa, small grains, and improved pastures. The native vegetation is dominantly big sagebrush, alkali sacaton, western wheatgrass, Great Basin wildrye grass, salt grass, and gumweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Utah. The Trenton soils are of moderate extent. They are locally important to agriculture. MLRA 28A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cache County, Utah, 1913.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: The zone from the surface to 15 inches. (Ap and Btn horizons)

Natric horizon: The zone from 8 to 60 inches. (Btn, Btnk1, Btnk2, and Btnk3 horizons)

The classification is based on "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006".  
The superactive cation exchange activity class is based on NSSL data.  Additional investigation is needed to determine if the Trenton series should be in the Vertic subgroup.  There are 2 chroma mottles in the 26 to 34 inch layer, however, the saturation is at 30 inches or deeper so the soil doesn't meet the aquic subgroup criteria.  Depth to aquic conditions also needs additional investigation for classification and drainage class assignment.
