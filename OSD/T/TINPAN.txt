TINPAN SERIES

Tinpan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff.  Tinpan soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tinpan soils are on plateaus.  They formed in alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,740 to 2,105 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 380 meters, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Karlo, Madeline, and Ninemile soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tinpan soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly low sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Nevada bluegrass, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  MLRA 23.
