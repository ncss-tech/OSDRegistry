TUMARION SERIES

The Tumarion series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rock.  Tumarion soils are on mesas and plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tumarion very cobbly loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 30 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk--3 to 10 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many fine irregular pores; many moderately thick calcium carbonate coatings on undersides of gravel; 75 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--10 to 12 inches; indurated silica-calcium carbonate cemented duripan with laminar cap; abrupt wavy boundary. (1 to 6 inches thick)

    3R--12 inches; basalt.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; 20 miles east of Lake Havasu City; 300 feet north and 2350 feet west of the southeast corner of Section 33, T. 14 N., R. 17 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section from December-February and for less than 20 days cumulative from July to October.  Driest during May and June and has a typic aridic moisture regime.

Control section: Clay content: 10 to 25 percent.
Rock Fragments:  35 to 80 percent gravel cobbles 

Soil Temperature:  61 to 72 degrees F.

Depth to hardpan:  5 to 14 inches

Depth to bedrock:  7 to 20 inches

A horizon - Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2, 3 or 4, dry or moist

Bk or Bkq horizon - Hue:  7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  2, 3 or 4, dry or moist
Texture:  Fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.

Consistence: Slightly hard or moderately hard.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Other features: Calcium carbonate coats with some pedons having secondary silica.

2 Bkqm horizon  Cementation: Indurated or very strongly.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bylas (AZ), Cline (AZ), Crosgrain (NV), Gotchell (AZ), Greyeagle (CA), Longjim (NV), and Marsite (CA) series.  Bylas soils are moist for more than 20 cumulative days during July-September.  Cline soils are intermittently moist for more than 20 days between July to October.  Crosgrain soils have a duripan which extends to greater than 60 inches.  Gotchell soils are shallow to consolidated fanglomerate and average less than 18 percent clay. Greyeagle soils do not have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches. Longjim soils contain less than 10 percent clay and do not have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Marsite soils contain less than 12 percent clay and do not have appreciable precipitation in the summer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tumarion soils are on mesas and plateaus at elevations of 2,200 to 5,000 feet.  These soils formed in alluvium from basalt, andesite, tuff and volcanic breccia.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 40 percent. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Akela, Alko, and Cave soils.  Akela soils do not have a duripan.  Alko and Cave soils are loamy and do not have bedrock below the duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained.  Medium to very high runoff.  Moderately rapid or moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tumarion soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The present vegetation is creosotebush, catclaw acacia, fluffgrass, cholla, ocotillo, white bursage, and ratany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of northwestern Arizona and southern Nevada; MLRA 30.  These soils are moderately extensive.
