GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Babco (TX), Belrose (TX), McNeely (TX), Turkey (TX), and Votaw (TX) series.
Babco soils: have spodic horizon; on mounds adjacent to the Tyden soils
Belrose soils: moderately well drained; on a slightly higher landform
McNeely, Turkey, and Votaw soils: sandy throughout; on a higher landform

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Tyden soils are very poorly drained.  Runoff is negligible. These soils remain ponded from December to April. An apparent water table exists from the surface to a depth of 203 cm (80 in) during the fall through spring months.

USE AND VEGETATION: Primarily used for woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes water oak, large gallberry, titi, buttonbush, and sweetbay.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Texas; LRR-T; MLRA-152B (Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods; small extent.
