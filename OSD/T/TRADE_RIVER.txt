TRADE RIVER SERIES 

The Trade River series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial aged alluvium over clayey lacustrine and in the underlying stratified calcareous silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on dissected glacial lake plains.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 millimeters (30 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C (42 degrees F).

SERIES PROPOSED:  Polk County, Wisconsin; 2008. Source of the name is the Trade river in Burnett and Polk counties.

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 46 to 94 centimeters (2B/E and 2Bt horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 152 centimeters (A, Bw1, Bw2, E/B, 2B/E, 2Bt, 3C1, and 3C2 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 36 centimeters (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons);
cambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 13 to 36 centimeters (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons);
glossic horizon--the zone from a depth of 36 to 71 centimeters (E/B and 2B/E horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 94 centimeters (2B/E and 2Bt horizons);
aquic conditions:
* Episaturation; 25 to 46 centimeters
* Redoximorphic concentrations: 25 to 46 centimeters
lithologic discontinuity-- at the upper boundary of the 2B/E horizon and at the upper boundary of the 3C1 horizon;
soil moisture control section--the zone from a depth of 10 to 30 centimeters; udic moisture regime;
soil temperature control section--at a depth of 50 centimeters; frigid soil temperature regime.

Carbonates are not visually recognizable in most of the stratified layers and are only evident through application of 1N HCl. The level of effervescence varies with each stratum and the carbonates are assumed to be depositional.

Cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar red clayey soils in the area.
