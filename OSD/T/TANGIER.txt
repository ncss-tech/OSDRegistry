SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: SPECIAL PROJECTS OFFICE

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Somerset County, Maryland, 2006.

REMARKS:
Tangier soils were previously mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas.
Some pedons have sulfides in the epipedon and upper solum.
Tangier soils can become extremely acid to strongly acid when drained, depending on sulfide content.
The original structure of the argillic horizon has been destroyed because of dispersion from salts.
Salinity of the water--ranges from 8 to 16 parts per thousand (ppt).
Tangier soils are classified as Alfisols due to elevated base saturation (35 percent or greater) in the subsoil resulting from infiltration with base-rich saline water. 
Tangier is named for Tangier Sound, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition):
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (Oese, Aseg, and Eseg horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 58 centimeters (Btg horizons)
Aquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters is continuously saturated (endosaturation)
Hemic soil materials--the zone from 0 to 10 centimeters (Oese horizon)
Lithologic discontinuity--58 to 200 centimeters
Particle size control section--18 to 58 centimeters (argillic horizon)
Hydrogen Sulfide Odor--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters
