TYLERCREEK SERIES

The Tylercreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Tylercreek soils are on hillslopes and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F (7.2 degrees C).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Emmon(CO), Headwaters (MT), Rabbitex (CO) Rothican (WY), Rothiemay (MT),and Zinzer (CO) series. Emmon soils are cobbly throughout the soil profile. Headwaters soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Rabbitex soils are deep to a lithic contact. Rothican and Rothiemay soils receive most of their precipitation from March to June which is the driest period for Tylercreek soils. Zinzer soils have a MAP of 7 inches (178 mm) with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Tylercreek soils are on fan remnants and hillslopes at elevations of 7,130 to 7,600 feet (2,200 to 2,275 meters).  Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent.  Tylercreek sloils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches (381 to 432 mm).  April, May and June are the driest months, with monsoonal pattern rainfall in August, September, and October.  Light to moderate rainfall and snowfall occur during the winter months.  Mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F (5 to 7.2 degrees C).  The average frost-free period is 100 to 119 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
These are the Lutherwood(UT)(T) and Countyline(UT)(T) series.  The Lutherwood and Countyline soils have argillic horizons and are on fan remnants and terraces generally lower in the landscape than the Tylercreek series.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained, moderately low runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing and habitat for wildlife. Native vegetation consists of black sagebrush, basin big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Sandberg bluegrass, antelope bitterbrush, mountain snowberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Utah; LRR E, MLRA 47; minor extent

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: BOZEMAN, MONTANA

SERIES PROPOSED: Kane County soil survey area, Utah.  The name Tylercreek is from a nearby stream.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches (25 to 100cm) (Bk,C,Ck horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 8.5 inches (0 to 21 cm)(A, Bk horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 8.5 to 60 inches (21 to 150 cm)(Bk2, Ck horizons) 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
