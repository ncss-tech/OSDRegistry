TENEB SERIES

The Teneb series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium in drainageways on plateaus or in mountains. Permeability is moderately slow and slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 36 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: 

Porrett - has an albic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Teneb soils are in drainageways on plateaus or in mountains at elevations of 1,600 to 3,500 feet. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. The slope range is 0 to 5 percent. The average annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches and the frost free season is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dowper, Elkridge, Grangemont, Kauder and Placer series. Dowper, Grangemont and Kauder soils are on hills, are well drained and have an ash mantle. Elkridge soils are on mountain and canyon side slopes, are skeletal and are well drained. Placer soils are on hills, are deep to bedrock and are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, Runoff is slow, permeability is moderately slow.  A seasonally perched water table is present.  Typically it occurs at 0 to 12 inches above the surface from November through June and 5 to 10 inches below the surface from October through July.  An apparent water table is present.  Typically it has a phreatic surface at 1 inch above the surface to 3 inches below the surface from November through June and 10 to 47 inches below the surface from July through October.  Flooding ranges from none in August and September to frequent, long or very long flooding from January through May.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing and watershed. Native vegetation is rushes, sedges, common camas, black hawthorn and tufted hairgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho; Teneb soils are not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
