THURMAN SERIES

The Thurman series consists of very deep somewhat excessively drained soils that formed mainly in sandy eolian material. They are on uplands and stream terraces and have slopes that range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is about 64 centimeters (25 inches) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Udorthentic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Thurman loamy fine sand with a slope of 4 percent in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

   A--15 to 25 centimeters (6 to l0 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy fine sand, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak coarse blocky structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary (Combined thickness of A horizon ranges from 25 to 76 centimeters (10 to 30 inches) thick)

   AC--25 to 36 centimeters (l0 to l4 inches); brown (10YR 5/3), loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary (10 to 25 centimeters (4 to l0 inches) thick)

   Cl--36 to 81 centimeters (l4 to 32 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; neutral; gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 51 centimeters (8 to 20 inches) thick)

   C2--81 to 203 centimeters (32 to 80 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pierce County, Nebraska; about 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) east and 5 kilometers (3 miles) south of Breslau; 402 meters (l,320 feet) east and 15 meters (50 feet) south of the northwest corner, sec. 2l, T. 27 N., R. 3 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture control section: moist in some part from October through April; intermittently moist from May through June; driest in July through September
Moisture regime: ustic
Depth to secondary carbonates: absent within a depth of 152 centimeters (5 feet)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 25 to 51 centimeters (l0 to 20 inches)
Depth to Rock Fragments: In some places, a few small or medium gravels are scattered throughout the profile

A horizon:
Hue: l0YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Chroma: l or 2 dry or moist
Texture: loamy fine sand, but includes fine sand, sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, 
and fine sandy loam
Reaction: slightly acid to neutral
Note: Some pedons will have an Ap surface horizon with a 10YR 4/2 color. After mixing the upper 25 cm the pedon still makes the color requirements for a mollic epipedon.  

AC horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist:
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry or moist
Texture: loamy fine sand, but includes fine sand, sand, loamy sand and sandy loam
Reaction: slightly acid to neutral

C horizon:
Hue: l0YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist
Texture: loamy fine sand, or fine sand but fine sand, loamy sand, sand, and very 
fine sand are allowed
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral; where the soils are underlain by calcareous bedrock or other calcareous materials, the overlying horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: uplands or stream terraces
Slopes: 0 to 40 percent
Parent material: eolian material, mainly loamy fine sands and fine sands
Mean annual temperature: 8 to 15 degrees C. (47 to 59 degrees F.)
Mean annual precipitation: 56 to 71 centimeters (22 to 28 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Blendon, Boelus, Doger, Hadar, Ipage, Ortello, and Valentine soils are the most common associates.
Blendon soils are coarse-loamy and cumulic.
Boelus soils are sandy over loamy.
Hadar soils have glacial till between 51 to 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches).
Ipage soils lack a mollic epipedon and are moderately well drained.
Valentine soils lack a mollic epipedon.
Ortello soils have a coarse-loamy control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:    
Drainage: somewhat excessively drained
Runoff: low on all but the steepest slopes
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: high.

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils with lower slope gradients are used mainly for cultivated crops, both dry land and irrigated.  
Corn, rye, vetch, and alfalfa are the principal crops, with a smaller acreage of winter wheat, oats, and grain sorghum.  
The native vegetation is mainly mid and tall species of grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central and northeastern Nebraska and south-central South Dakota and Southwest Minnesota. LRR M MLRA 102C.  Northeast Kansas LRR H MLRA 106.  The series is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Rock County, Nebraska, l932.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Ap and A horizons) 
Moisture regime: udic-ustic 
Buried A horizons: 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) in some pedons  Some pedons have loamy material ranging from sandy loam to silty clay loam at depths below 102 centimeters (40 inches).  In some places, mainly on stream terraces, gravelly substrata are below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data from 4 profiles of Thurman soils is provided on pages 183-189 of Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 5.  "Soil Survey Laboratory Data and Descriptions for Some Soils of Nebraska"

Modified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.

9/24/2008 NAD Added dry to follow dry colors in the RIC. Expanded range of A horizon value to include Value 4 moist as this is common to have a thin layer in cropped fields. Added statement in RIC A horizon to state that mixing the upper 25 cm the color requirement for a mollic epipedon is still met. Added LRR to distribution and extent.
