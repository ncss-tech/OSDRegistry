TAGGART SERIES

The Taggart series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess or silty sediments and in the underlying loamy outwash. The Taggart soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, mesic Aeric Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Taggart silt loam, on a nearly level, convex slope in a hayfield at an elevation of 232 meters (760 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; common medium very dark brown (10YR 2/2) iron and manganese oxide concretions; few fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions throughout; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) thick]

 Btg1--58 to 79 cm (23 to 31 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; few fine roots; many distinct gray (10YR 6/1) clay films on faces of peds; many coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; many coarse very dark brown (10YR 2/2) iron and manganese oxide concretions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Btg2--79 to 114 cm (31 to 45 inches); gray (10YR 6/1) silty clay loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; few fine roots; many distinct gray (10YR 5/1) clay films on faces of peds; many coarse prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; many coarse very dark brown (10YR 2/2) iron and manganese oxide concretions; very strongly acid; abrupt irregular boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt or Btg horizon is 71 to 112 cm (28 to 44 inches).]

 2Bt--114 to 188 cm (45 to 74 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many distinct gray (10YR 6/1) clay films on faces of peds; many fine and medium very dark brown (10YR 2/2) iron and manganese oxide concretions; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [63 to 89 cm (25 to 35 inches) thick]

 2BC--188 to 203 cm (74 to 80 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Morgan County, Indiana; about 3 miles east southeast of Martinsville; 1,460 feet east and 1,320 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 7, T. 11 N., R. 2 E.; USGS Cope, Indiana topographic quadrangle; lat. 39 degrees 24 minutes 9.8 seconds N. and long. 86 degrees 21 minutes 25.2 seconds W., NAD 27; UTM Zone 16, 555361 easting and 4361671 northing, NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Canal, Lauer, Lieber, Tiro, and Westboro series. Canal and Tiro soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Lauer soils have textures with less than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Lieber soils have subhorizons within the argillic horizon with brittle properties. Westboro soils have a secondary zone of leaching (E/Bt horizon) below the upper part of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Taggart soils are on outwash plains, outwash terraces, and stream terraces of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or silty sediments and in the underlying loamy outwash that has a paleosol. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1067 mm (38 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chetwynd, Gallimore, Parke, and Pike soils on outwash plains. The well drained Chetwynd and Gallimore soils are on backslopes. The well drained Parke and Pike soils are on summits and shoulders.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. In drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. A few areas are used for forest or pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Indiana, southern Ohio, and northern West Virginia; MLRAs 114A and 114B (Indiana and Ohio), MLRA 124 (Ohio), and MLRA 126 (Ohio and West Virginia). The type location is in MLRA 114B. This series is of small extent.
