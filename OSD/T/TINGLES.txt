TYPICAL PEDON:  Tingles silty clay loam, on a permanently submerged lagoon bottom, < 0.1 percent slope, under 270 centimeters of strongly saline water.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.  

   Ag--0 to 3 inches (0 to 8 centimeters); greenish black (10Y 2.5/1) silty clay loam; massive; very sticky; very fluid; slightly alkaline; abrupt boundary (1 to 17 inches (1 to 44 centimeters) thick

   Cseg--3 to 96 inches (8 to 245 centimeters); very dark greenish gray (10Y 3/1) silty clay loam; massive; very sticky; very fluid; sulfurous odor; slightly alkaline; slightly saline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Worcester County, Maryland; approximately 2.88 miles north-northwest of the Pirate Islands and approximately 2.34 miles east-southeast of Public Landing in Chincoteague Bay.  USGS Tingles Island topographic quadrangle; lat. 38 degrees, 08 minutes, 20 seconds N. and long. 75 degrees, 14 minutes, 43 seconds W., WGS 84. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock:  Greater than 80 inches (200 centimeters)
Shell Fragments:  Typically 0 to 5 percent, by volume but could range up to 25 percent if a former historic oyster reef is present
Soil Reaction:  Slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline, throughout
Oxidized pH:  Ultra acid
Depth to sulfidic materials (sulfurous odor or peroxide reaction): 0 to 20 inches (0 to 50 centimeters) (a horizon at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) thick within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface)
Electrical Conductivity: Greater than 5.3 dS m-1
Salinity:  Greater than 29 ppt throughout the profile

Range of Individual Horizons:
Ag, Ase, Aseg, or ACseg horizon:
Color--hue of 10Y, 10GY, 5GY, 5Y, 2.5Y or N, value of 2.5 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2
Texture--silty clay loam, silty clay, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sand or their mucky analogs
Consistence--non fluid to very fluid
Sulfurous odor and sulfidic materials are present.  

Cseg horizon or 2Cseg horizon (if present):
Color--hue of 10Y, 5GY, 10GY, N, 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0  
Texture--silty clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay 
Consistence-moderately fluid to very fluid
Organic carbon ranges from 11.3 to 15.2 g kg-1. 
Sulfurous odor and sulfidic materials are present. 

Some pedons in Barnegat Bay have had buried and preserved pre-Holocene (lithologic discontinuity) albic and spodic horizons in vibracores at depths greater than 60 inches (150 centimeters) from the soil surface (2014NJ029020 and 2014NJ029021).

COMPETING SERIES:  
Truitt soils (tentative)--have a buried organic soil starting below 40 inches (1 meter)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape:  Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Estuaries
Landform:  Low-energy lagoon bottoms
Parent Material:  Fine-silty lagoon bottom estuarine deposits
Slope:  0 to 0.1 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature:  50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Water Depth Range:  1 to 11 feet (1.0 to 3.5 meters)
Water Regime:  Tidal, 1 to 3 feet (0.3 to 1 meter) tidal range
Water Salinity Range:  26 to 32 ppt

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Middlemoor soils (tentative)--have n values <0.7 and have coarser textures below 40 inches (1 meter)
Coards soils--have higher quantities of clay (>30%) and n values > 1, throughout the profile.
Southpoint soils--fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments, relict marsh sediments, and upland subaerial soils on mainland coves and submerged wave-cut headlands.
Sinepuxent soils--coarse-loamy soils formed in mixed dredge spoil materials
Demas soils--sandy soils formed in barrier island dune sediments on storm-surge washover fan flats.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous and peraquic soil moisture regime
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Low to moderately low
Soil is permanently submerged with salt or brackish water. The presence of sulfidic material within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for acid sulfate drainage if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major Uses:  These soils are used for human recreation and benthic habitats as a source for food, shelter, and other essential life support.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and possibly Virginia.  This series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE:  Raleigh, North Carolina

REMARKS:  
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 3 inches (0 to 8 cm) (Ag horizon)
Peraquic feature - Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (under 9 feet (270 centimeters) of salt water).
Particle size control section - The zone from 0 to 40 inches (0 to 100 centimeters).
