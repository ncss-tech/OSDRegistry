TENVORRD SERIES

The Tenvorrd series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Tenvorrd soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tenvorrd silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 13 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic, many very fine and fine roots; many very fine vesicular and tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--13 to 23 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine, few fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Bk--23 to 48 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; few fine carbonate filaments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (15 to 33 cm thick)

    Bqkm--48 to 100 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated duripan, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; 1 to 3 mm thick continuous silica laminae capping upper surface of horizon; few fractures; few very fine roots along fracture planes; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about 38 miles south of Carlin near Mineral Hill; about 500 feet south and 2,400 feet west of the approximate northeast corner of section 8, T. 26 N., R. 52 E.; USGS Mineral Hill NW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 9 minutes 15 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 7 minutes 52 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.1550000 latitude, -116.1311111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry in mid-June through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to indurated duripan: 25 to 50 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages less than 5 percent.

A horizon  
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, the top 18 cm when mixed is greater than 5.5 dry.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Platy, subangular blocky or it is massive.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Bk horizon  
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Silt loam or loam.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline through strongly alkaline.
Effervescence:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.  Carbonate is present as few to common filaments or it is disseminated.
Calcium carbonate: 5 to 10 percent
Other features:  Subhorizons containing up to 10 percent durinodes are present in some pedons.

Bqkm horizon  
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arritola, Besslen, Chiara, Coltroop Frohman, Minveno, Nevoyer, Otoole, Peeko, Plegomir, Scoon, and Yahoo series.  

Arritola soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in their particle-size control section and lack a Bk horizon above the duripan.  Besslen, Frohman, Otoole, Scoon soils have less than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control section. Chiara and Peeko soils lack a Bk horizon above the duripan.  Coltroop, Minveno and Nevoyer soils have bedrock within 100 cm.
Plegomir soils have 5 to 30 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Yahoo soils have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 30 percent in the Bqk horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tenvorrd soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  They formed in alluvium from derived mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,659 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 95 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cortez and Kodra soils. Cortez and Kodra soils are moderately deep.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly Utah juniper, big sagebrush, low sagebrush, Douglas rabbitbrush, Sandberg bluegrass and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.
