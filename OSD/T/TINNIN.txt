TINNIN SERIES

The Tinnin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in predominantly granitic alluvium or eolian sands.  Tinnin soils are on low alluvial terraces of fans and narrow ridges and mounds and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Entic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tinnin loamy coarse sand - on a 0 percent slope in an almond orchard.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on May 12, 1977, the soil was moist throughout).

   Ap--0 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 2 percent rounded gravel; mildly alkaline (pH 7.5); diffuse smooth boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

   A--14 to 28 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 2 percent rounded gravel; neutral (pH 7.0) diffuse wavy boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

   C1--28 to 53 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loamy coarse sand, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common medium distinct light brown (7.5YR 6/4) mottles, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine interstitial pores; 2 percent rounded gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); diffuse wavy boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick)

   C2--53 to 75 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; common medium distinct light brown (7.5YR 6/4) mottles, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonplastic and nonsticky; many very fine interstitial pores; 2 percent rounded gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  San Joaquin County, California; 4 miles southwest of Manteca; 500 feet due west of the intersection of Airport Road and Nile Road, and 100 feet south of drainage ditch; 450 feet north and 500 feet west of the southeast corner of section 13, T.2 S., R.6 E., Lathrop Quadrangle.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of about 14 and 43 inches is usually dry in all parts from June to November unless irrigated, and moist in all parts from January to May.  Distinct and prominent mottles usually are present at depths of 22 to 48 inches.  The soil has 1 to 10 percent fine (2-5 mm) rounded gravel.  Clay content is 0 to 10 percent throughout.

The A horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, or 4/3 and 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3 moist.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  This horizon has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.

The C horizon has color of 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3 or 7/4, and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/3 or 3/4.  It commonly is loamy coarse sand or loamy sand, but includes sand in the lower part of some pedons.  The upper C horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline, and the lower C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Baywood and Timor series.  Baywood soils lack mottles.  Timor soils have a Bk horizon within 40 inches overlying a Bqkm horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tinnin soils are on low alluvial fans and narrow ridges and mounds, where wind modified.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in predominantly granitic alluvium.  Elevations are 5 to 110 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs in winter months.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 to 61 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 260 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delhi, Honcut, Manteca and Veritas soils.  Honcut and Veritas soils are coarse-loamy.  Manteca soils are coarse-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for irrigated cropland growing primarily almonds, alfalfa, onions, tomatoes, small grains, grapes and pasture.  Vegetation consists of red brome, filaree, soft chess, wildoats, ripgut brome and scattered valley oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast side of the San Joaquin Valley.  The soils are moderately extensive.
