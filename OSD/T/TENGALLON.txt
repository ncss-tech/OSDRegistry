TENGALLON SERIES

The Tengallon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from Mancos Shale. Tengallon soils are on dissected pediments, plains and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, gypsic, mesic Typic Calcigypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tengallon sandy clay loam, on a south facing, 3 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 5,300 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on November 14, 1997 the soil was dry.

    A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; 13 percent calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk--3 to 9 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate thick platy structure; moderately hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots throughout; common fine irregular calcium carbonate masses; 17 percent calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 14 inches thick)

    By1--9 to 17 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gypsiferous loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; common fine gypsum crystals, 26 percent gypsum; 11 percent calcium carbonate; 5 percent parachanners; violently effervescent;  moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (12 to 25 inches thick By horizons)

    By2--17 to 28 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) gypsiferous loam,  light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots matted around shale fragments and between peds; few very fine discontinuous tubular pores; common fine irregular masses of gypsum between peds, 22 percent gypsum; 21 percent calcium carbonate; 10 percent parachanners; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.

    Cr--28 to 46 inches; soft Mancos Shale.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  residuum derived from Mancos Shale (Many areas have some eolian influence in the surface layers)
Landform:  dissected pediments, plains and hills
Slopes:  3 to 12 percent
Elevation:  4,700 to 5,700 feet
Mean annual temperature:  52 to 56 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  7 to 10 inches
