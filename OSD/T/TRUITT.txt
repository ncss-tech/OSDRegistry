COMPETING SERIES:
Tingles soils--do not have a buried organic horizon within 79 inches (2 meters) of the soil surface

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape:  Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Estuaries
Landform:  Mainland coves or submerged wave-cut headlands of Holocene age
Parent Material:  Fine-silty lagoonal deposits over buried organic materials formed at or near sea level when it was at a lower elevation
Slope:  0.1 to 0.25 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Water Depth Range: Less than 79 inches (2.0 meters)
Water Regime:  Tidal, 13 to 39 inches (0.3 to 1 meter) range[DJW14]
Water Salinity Range:  26 to 32 ppt [DJW15][r16]

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Southpoint soils--are fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments, relict marsh sediments, and upland subaerial soils on mainland coves and submerged wave-cut headlands
Coards soils--are fine-silty soils formed in mixed fluvial and lagoonal sediments on fluviomarine bottoms
Tumagan soils (tentative)--have organic horizons at or near the soil surface 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class:  Subaqueous drainage and peraquic soil moisture regime
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Low to moderately low (not sure of saturated hydraulic conductivity for these soils)

Soil is permanently submerged with salt or brackish water. The presence of sulfidic material within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for acid sulfate drainage if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses:  Most areas are un-vegetated and function as estuarine benthic wildlife habitat is limited. Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish are rare.
Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima). Vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 5 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and possibly Virginia.  This series is of small extent.
