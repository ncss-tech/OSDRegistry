TENNEYCANYON SERIES 

The Tenneycanyon series consists of very deep, and deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum and reworked eolian deposits derived from sandstone. Tenneycanyon soils are on hillslopes, and sand sheets on structural benches.  Slope ranges 2 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mesic, coated Lamellic Ustic Quartzipsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Tenneycanyon fine sand--rangeland, (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated). Surface is covered with 5 percent gravel.

TYPE LOCATION: Kane County, Utah; lat. 37 degrees 9 minutes 30.85 seconds N. and long. 112 degrees 18 minutes 58.52 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture - The soils are dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days during normal years, but are not dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days when the soil temperature at 50 cm is greater than 43 degrees F. In normal years, the soils are moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the four months following the winter solstice and are dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days during the 4 months following the summer solstice.  Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 53 degrees F. 

Depth to bedrock: 40 to >60 inches deep.

Depth to lamellae:  40 to 60 inches.

Particle-size control section: 

Clay content:  1 to 10 percent clay

Rock fragments: Gravel content ranges from 0 to 25 percent. 

Reaction: neutral to slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: residuum and reworked eolian deposits derived from sandstone
Landform: hillslopes, and sand sheets on structural benches
Elevation: 5,550 to 6,500 feet
Slope: 2 to 15 percent
Mean annual temperature: 45 to 51 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 12 to 16 inches
Frost-free period: 100 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pinepoint and Parkwash soils. Pinepoint soils are deep to very deep and lack lamellae. Parkwash soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches and lack lamellae. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: excessively drained; low runoff; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat. Potential native vegetation includes Utah juniper, two-needle pinyon, green mormontea, broom snakeweed, bitterbrush, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, sandhill muhly, and sixweeks fescue.  These soils have been correlated to correlated Upland Sand (Utah Juniper-pinyon) 035XY324UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah.  The series is of limited extent.  MLRA 35.
