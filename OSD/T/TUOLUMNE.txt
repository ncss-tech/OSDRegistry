TUOLUMNE SERIES

The Tuolumne series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, and/or till from granitic rocks. Tuolumne soils are on alluvial fans, mountain slopes, aprons on mountainsides, talus slopes, colluvial aprons, moraines, stream terraces, ancient landslides, avalanche chutes, bedrock benches, bedrock joints, and ephemeral streams. Slope is 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,040 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Vitrandic Xerorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Tuolumne cobbly loamy coarse sand, on a north facing, 70 percent slope under a cover of interior live oak at an elevation of 1433 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on August 4, 1999 the soil was moist throughout.)

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tuolumne soils are on alluvial fans, mountain slopes, aprons on mountainsides, talus slopes, colluvial aprons, moraines, ancient landslides, avalanche chutes, bedrock benches, bedrock joints, stream terraces, and ephemeral streams. Slope is 2 to 70 percent. Elevation is 654 to 1,989 meters. These soils formed in colluvium, alluvium or till derived from granitoid rock. The climate is Mediterranean with moist and cold winters and warm and dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 838 to 1,245 mm. Mean annual temperature is 5.0  to 11.7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Half Dome soils. Half Dome soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size class and an umbric and/or cambic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium or high runoff; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. The vegetation is black oak, live oak, white fir, Ponderosa pine, and mixed coniferous forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. The soils of this series are of limited extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yosemite National Park, California, 2007. Proposed in 2006.

REMARKS: Isotic mineralogy class based on lab data. Tuolumne soils have an ochric epipedon and do not have a cambic horizon. 

The vegetation according to Preliminary Description of Terrestrial Natural Community of California, Robert F. Holland and Fish and Game, State of California, 1986" is Black Oak Woodland (71120), Interior Live Oak Woodland (71150), White Fir Mixed Coniferous Forest (84232), Sierra Mixed Coniferous Forest (84230), Westside Ponderosa Pine Forest (84210), Ponderosa Pine Mixed Coniferous Forest (84231), and Mixed, North Slope Forest (81500)

Some pedons have one or more O horizons.

Series updated in 2021 to include ranges of Tuolumne soils described in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Climate ranges and vegetation were not updated at this time.

Series previously classified as Sandy-skeletal, isotic, mesic Dystric Xerorthents. Updated in 2021.
