COMPETING SERIES:
Broadaxe soils--are on submerged wave-cut platform landforms and often contain former preserved spodic fluviomarine diagnostic soil horizons
Mullet soils--are on washover-fan flat landforms within estuaries and lagoons and often have hues on the gley pages

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material--Sandy marine deposits
Landscape--Gulfs, bays, and coastal estuaries
Landform--Longshore bars, barrier coves
Slope--0 to 2 percent
Mean annual precipitation--1264 to 1737 millimeters (50 to 68 inches)
Mean annual air temperature--19 to 21 degrees C (66 to 70 degrees F)
Water salinity range--18 to 30 parts per thousand

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Handsboro, Kesson, and St. Lucie soils.
Handsboro soils--are in tidal salt marshes and have thick organic soil horizons throughout
Kesson soils--are very poorly drained, often have eolian origins, and are not permanently submerged
St. Lucie soils--are excessively drained on adjacent dunes, have eolian origins and are much higher on the landscape

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--Subaqueous
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--High or very high
Soil moisture regime--Peraquic
Soil is permanently inundated with saline and brackish water with considerable tidal exchange which limits the development of sulfidic soil material.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Major uses--Supports benthic aquatic habitat and is used for fishing and recreational and commercial shellfish harvesting
Native vegetation--Native algae and eelgrass (Zostera marina); vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 35 percent 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area--Located along the Alabama and Mississippi Gulf coast
Land Resource Regions--T - Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region 
MLRA(s)--MLRA  152A
Extent--Small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Special Projects Office

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Harrison County, Mississippi, 2025

REMARKS: This subaqueous series was previously mapped as water in Harrison County, Mississippi Soil Surveys.  The name was selected by professors at Southern Mississippi University named after one of their research vessels.  The name originates from a combination of Thalassia and Callinectes, the genera for turtlegrass and blue crab, respectively.

Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:
Peraquic moisture regime--The zone from 0 to 200 centimeters has positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 144 centimeters of salt water).
Particle-size control section--The zone from 0 to 100 centimeters (0 to 40 inches).
Fluventic Feature--soil organic carbon content of greater than 0.2 percent at a depth of 125 centimeters.

Taxonomic version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th edition (2022)

ADDITIONAL DATA: 
Characterization data for the typical pedon, S2024MS047016 and additional pedon data, S2024MS047012 analyzed by North Carolina State University.
