TALIHINA SERIES

The Talihina series consists of shallow, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in predominantly clayey material weathered from soft shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These sloping to steep soils are on smooth ridge crests and side slopes of uplands mostly in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slopes range from 5 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, active, thermic, shallow Aquic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Talihina clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A1--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; firm, hard; few fragments of sandstone 3 to 10 inches in diameter and few fragments over 10 inches; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 9 inces thick)

  Bw--6 to 15 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) dry; common fine distinct brownish yellow redoximorphic concentration masses in lower part; moderate fine blocky structure in upper part grading to weak medium blocky in lower part; very firm; extremely hard; few pressure faces on peds; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

  Cr--15 to 25 inches; olive gray (5Y 4/2) soft shale, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) dry; level bedded; fractured; few thin strata of siltstone; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Hughes County, Oklahoma; about 2 miles east of Holdenville; about 510 feet north and 550 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 10, T. 7 N., R. 9 E.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: These soils formed in materials weathered from shale with thin layers of interbedded sandstone and siltstone.
Landform: sloping to steep dissected uplands 
Slopes: 5 to 20 percent, but can range to 30
Elevation: 500 to 1000 feet
Mean annual temperature: 57 to 63 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 38 to 44 inches
Frost-free period: 200 to 220 days.
Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 64 to 70

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Barden, Eram, and Liberal series and the Barco, Bates, Collinsville, Coweta, Dennis, and Vinita series.  Barden, Dennis, Eram, Liberal, and Vinita soils are on landscapes in lower positions.
Bates, Collinsville, and Coweta soils are on smooth ridges and they formed in material weathered from sandstone.
All of these soils, except Collinsville and Coweta, have an argillic horizon.  Collinsville and Coweta soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage: poorly drained 
Runoff: moderate to very high
Permeability: slow 
These soils have a perched water table within a depth of 0.5 to 2.0 feet for short periods of time from November to April.

USE AND VEGETATION: The primary use is native range.
The native vegetation is tall grass prairie.  Scattered elm, sumac, hawthorne, persimmon, and osage-orange trees are present in some areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Oklahoma, southeastern Kansas, and southwestern Missouri. The series is extensive.
