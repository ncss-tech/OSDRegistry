TONIGUT SERIES

The Tonigut series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Tonigut soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 40 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

    Bk2--30 to 43 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, carbonates are disseminated and segregated as thin and moderately thick coats on undersides of rock fragments; 75 percent channers; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (The combined thickness of the Bk horizon ranges from 22 to 34 inches thick)

    Cr--43 to 52 inches; weathered shale; vertical cracks are more than 4 inches apart; fine and very fine roots follow cracks 3 to 6 inches into the layer.

    R--52 inches; unweathered shale bedrock.

Saddlehorse and Tosca soils occur on mountain slopes and have calcic horizons.

Soward soils occur on stream terraces and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are wildlife habitat and recreation.  The potential native plant community is Douglas-fir, mountain lover, snowberry, Oregon-grape, bluegrass, needlegrass, sedge, and quaking aspen.  This soil has been correlated to the High Mountain Very Steep Loam (Douglas-fir)- 048AY530UT range site in Utah.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Uintah County, Uintah Area Soil Survey, Utah, 1998.  The name is taken from a nearby geographic location.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 2 to 30 inches.  (A1, A2, Bw, Bw2, Bk1 horizons)

Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 41 inches.  (Cr horizon)

Lithic contact:  The contact with unweathered shale at 50 inches.  (R horizon)

The cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

Taxonomic version:  Seventh Edition, 1996.
