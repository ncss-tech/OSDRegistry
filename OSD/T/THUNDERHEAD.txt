THUNDERHEAD SERIES

The Thunderhead series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary or igneous rock. They are on cuestas, hills, mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 8 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcidic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Thunderhead gravelly loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 5 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) gravelly loam, dark olive brown (2.5Y 3/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt--5 to 13 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and on surface of fragments; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.3); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk1--13 to 22 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gravelly loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and common soft masses of calcium carbonate; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk2--22 to 28 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) very gravelly silty clay loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; 30 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and common soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

    Cr--28 to 40 inches; light olive gray (5Y 6/2) semiconsolidated sedimentary beds that crush to silt loam, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 13 inches thick)

    R--40 inches; hard sedimentary rock.
