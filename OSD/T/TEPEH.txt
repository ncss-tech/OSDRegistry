TEPEH SERIES

The Tepeh series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Tepeh soils are on slopes of 25 to 100 percent on debris aprons, debris cones, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,900 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Andic Dystrocryepts

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Angelbasin, McCay, Prouty, Skinwood, Smokejump, Twentymile, and Venson series.  Angelbasin, Skinwood, Smokejump, and Venson soils are all moderately deep (50 to 100 cm) to a lithic contact. McCay soils are deep (100 to 150 cm) to a paralithic contact. Prouty soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 cm) to a paralithic contact. Twentymile soils are moderately deep (50 to 89 cm) to a densic contact with dense glacial till. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tepeh soils are on slopes of 25 to 100 percent on debris aprons, debris cones, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 800 to 2,000 meters.  They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,500 to 3,300 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 8 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Doubtful, Perfect, Spickard, and Stetattle soils.  Doubtful soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 cm) to a lithic contact.  Perfect soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and vitrandic soil properties through a majority of the control section.  Spickard soils have a contrasting particle-size control section and andic soil material greater than 35 cm thick.  Stetattle soils have a pachic umbric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tepeh soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed drainage. Native vegetation includes Pacific silver fir, western hemlock, mountain hemlock, and occasionally Engelmann spruce and Alaska yellow cedar.  Understory species include big huckleberry, Cascade azalea, lady fern, broadleaf lupine, and fringecup.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
