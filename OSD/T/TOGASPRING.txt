TOGASPRING SERIES

The Togaspring series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Togaspring soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Saido series.  Saido soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on ustic, have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 13, and do not have endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Togaspring soils are on low stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks that has been enriched in evaporite minerals.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Fettic and Voltaire soils.  Fettic soils are fine-silty, have mixed mineralogy, and have mollic epipedons and natric horizons.  Voltaire soils are fine-loamy, have mixed mineralogy, have aquic conditions within 50 cm of the soil surface, and have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 100 and 157 cm (deep free water occurrence class) between September and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and March.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Togaspring soils are used for rangeland, wildlife habitat, and urban development.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, Torrey's saltbush, and inland saltgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  These soils are not extensive with about 620 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 26.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

REMARKS:  This soil was previously correlated as Job Variant in the Soil Survey of Douglas County Area, Nevada.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Ayz, Byz1, and part of the Byz2 horizons).
Gypsic horizon - The zone from 5 to 157 cm (Byz1, Byz2, Byz3, Byz4, BCy1, and BCy2 horizons).
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 100 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the BCy1 and BCy2 horizons).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Byz3 and Byz4 horizons and parts of the Byz2 and BCy1 horizons).

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S01NV-005-001 (pedon # 02N0630).  Selected data are available.
