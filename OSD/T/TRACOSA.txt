TRACOSA SERIES

The Tracosa series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits and storm washover sediments of Holocene age. These soils are on broad tidal flats on low coastal plains and on slightly depressional tidal areas on barrier islands. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 0.5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, nonacid, hyperthermic Sodic Endoaquents

TYPICAL PEDON: Tracosa mucky silty clay--on a 0.1 percent slope in a flat area, in grass; elevation is 2 m (6.5 ft) (Colors are for wet soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ag--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in); very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) broken face mucky silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2), dry; massive; very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots and common fine roots; noneffervescent; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 46 cm [3 to 18 in] thick)

  Cg1--20 to 64 cm (8 to 25 in); dark gray (5Y 4/1) broken face silty clay; massive; very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots; 1 percent fine distinct olive (5Y 5/4), moist, masses of oxidized iron with diffuse boundaries in matrix; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

  Cg2--64 to 120 cm (25 to 47 in); greenish gray (5GY 5/1) reduced silty clay; massive; very firm, very sticky, very plastic; common fine roots; 8 percent fine prominent olive yellow (5Y 6/6), moist, masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries in matrix; 1 percent coarse irregular weakly cemented carbonate nodules that are pitted and resemble the shape of popcorn; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (combined thickness is 20 to 183 cm [8 to 72 in] thick)

  Cg3--120 to 203 cm (47 to 80 in); greenish gray (5GY 5/1) reduced clay; massive; very firm, very sticky, very plastic; 8 percent medium prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/8), moist, masses of oxidized iron with sharp boundaries In matrix and 10 percent medium prominent olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6), moist, masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries in matrix; 2 percent coarse irregular moderately cemented carbonate nodules that are pitted and resemble the shape of popcorn.; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline.

Barbary, Barrada, Gentilly, Levy, Scatlake, and Tatlum soils: have n-values of more than 0.7 between 20 to 51 cm (8 and 20 in) of the soil surface.
Follet soils: have a fine-silty control section.
Harris soils: have a mollic epipedon and an aquic moisture regime.
Placedo soils: are not flooded by daily tides.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
These are the competing Follet, Harris, Placedo, and Tatlum series and the Mustang, Narta, Velasco, and Veston series.
Follet and Tatlum soils: occur on the same position.
Harris, Mustang, Narta, Placedo, Velasco, and Veston soils: occur on a slightly higher position and have a water table that is below the soil surface at least some time during the year.

Runoff:  high 
Seasonal water table: permanent water table is at or slightly above the soil surface during low tides to 30 cm (12 in) above the surface during high tides. These soils remain saturated throughout the year.

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Used for wildlife habitat land and livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of smooth cordgrass, Salicornia, and Batis species.
Ecological sites assigned to phases and components of this series are listed below.  Current ecological site assignments are in Web Soil Survey.  Components of this series include the following ecological sites: Tidal Flats 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
General area: Along the Upper Gulf Coast in Southeast Texas
Land Resource Region: T-Atlantic and Gulf Coast Lowland Forest and Crop Region
Major Land Resource Aarea:  MLRA 150B - Gulf Coast Saline Prairies
Extent: large
SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Brazoria County, Texas; 1978.

REMARKS: These soils were formerly classified as a miscellaneous land type, Tidal flat, or were included with the Harris series.  This soil has halic properties as described by J. R. Coover, et al., in SSSA Proceedings, 1975.  The typical pedon site was changed during the update of MLRA 150B to a location with lab data. 

Classification changed from Typic Haplaquents to Sodic Endoaquents 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Further study and characterization data of the series is needed to verify classification.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (Ag horizon)
Sodic subgroup: Salinity from tidal flooding (ESP more than 20)
Peraquic moisture regime.
