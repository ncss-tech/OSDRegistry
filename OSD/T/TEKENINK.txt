TEKENINK SERIES

The Tekenink series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy loam till. These soils are on ground moraines, recessional moraines, or end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Tekenink loamy sand, on a 3 percent slope in a cultivated area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.

    Ap--0 to 33 cm (13 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure parts to weak medium granular structure; very friable; common fine roots and common very fine roots; 7 percent subrounded mixed gravel; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

[0 to 74 cm (29 inches) thick]

    B/E--82 to 180 centimeters; 58 percent brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam and 42 percent pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy sand; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; common distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on all faces of peds; 3 percent subrounded mixed cobbles and 5 percent subrounded mixed gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick]

    Bt--180 to 200 centimeters; brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam; 12  percent clay; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; friable;  few very fine pores; few distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4)  clay films on all faces of peds; 3 percent  subrounded indurated mixed gravel; noneffervescent;  neutral. [20 to 76 cm (8 to 30 inches) thick]

A sandy substratum phase below 152 cm (60 inches) is recognized.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Steamburg series. Steamburg soils have textures that average less than 52 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tekenink soils are on ground moraines, recessional moraines, and end moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 18 percent and range from 0 to 40 percent. The Tekenink soils formed in sandy loam till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 965 mm (28 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The somewhat poorly drained Teasdale soils and the poorly drained Barry soils form a drainage sequence with Tekenink soils. Spinks and Oshtemo soils are nearby in most areas. Spinks soils do not have continuous argillic horizons. Oshtemo soils do not have glossic horizons and, in addition, are underlain by gravelly sand.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on the slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: The more gentle slopes are used for general farming with small grains, legume-grass hay, corn and dry beans being the principal crops. Potatoes comprise a major acreage in some areas. Steeper slopes are used for woodland or permanent pasture. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. Tree species include sugar maple beech, oak, basswood, and black cherry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96, 97, and 98 in central Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
