     Cg1--3 to 17 inches; black (N 2/0) sand; few fine faint very dark gray (5Y 3/1) mottles; single grain; loose; moderately alkaline; strongly saline; clear smooth boundary.

     Cg2--17 to 31 inches; dark gray (5Y 4/1) sand; few medium distinct very dark gray (N 3/0) mottles; single grain; loose; slightly alkaline; strongly saline; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Cg horizon is 19 to 30 inches.)

     2Ab--31 to 36 inches; very dark gray (N 3/0) loam; massive; friable; n-value 0.9, material flows with little difficulty between fingers when squeezed; 20 percent, by volume shell fragments; 10 percent, by volume strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) organic fragments; slightly alkaline; strongly saline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 inches thick)

     2C'g3--36 to 41 inches; very dark greenish gray (5GY 3/1) loamy sand; few medium distinct black (N 2/0) mottles; massive; very friable; 5 percent, by volume shell fragments; 2 percent, by volume strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) organic fragments; slightly alkaline; strongly saline; gradual wavy boundary.

     2C'g4--41  to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) sand; common medium prominent black (N 2/0) mottles; single grain; loose; 1 percent, by volume shell fragments; 1 percent, by volume light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) organic fragments; slightly alkaline; strongly saline.

COMPETING SERIES: None

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Estuaries
Landform: Barrier flats
Parent Material: Barrier island washover sediments overlying loamy paleo-terrestrial tidal marsh materials
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 57 degrees F.
Mean Annual Water Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F.
Bathymetry: 0.7 to 4.5 feet below MSL
Water Regime: Tidal, 1.0 to 2.0 feet tidal range

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Demas soils (tentative)--have a sandy particle-size control section, do not have sulfidic materials, at similar water depths
Whittington soils (tentative)--have a sandy particle-size control section, do not have sulfidic materials, at slightly shallower water depths
Purnell soils--have surface organic layers 8 to 15 inches thick and are not permanently submersed; on adjacent tidal marshes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
  Agricultural Drainage Class: Very poorly drained (permanently submersed)
  Index Surface Runoff: Negligible
  Permeability: Moderately rapid or rapid
 
USE AND VEGETATION:
  Major Uses: Most areas are vegetated and function as estuarine benthic wildlife habitat.  Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish are common.
  Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima).  Vegetative cover ranges from 10 to 60 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Maryland and Delaware and possibly Virginia.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1998.

REMARKS: Tizzard soils were formerly included with miscellaneous areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support submersed aquatic vegetation.  These soils would classify in the proposed "Subaquic Sulfic" subgroup.  Refer to "Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland;" G.P. Demas, J.H. Brown, and M.C. Rabenhorst; July 1998.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon (oxidized)--the zone from 0 to 1 inches (A horizon)
Peraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 60 inches is permanently saturated
Sulfidic feature--The zone from 31 to 36 inches contains sulfidic materials (verified by moist incubation)
