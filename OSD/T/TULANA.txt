REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--Ap, A horizons
*Volcanic glass--C horizon
*Aquic conditions--all horizons
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm

The soils in their natural conditions have an aquic soil moisture regime.

Base saturation is less than 50 percent by sum of cations and by ammonium acetate in the lower part of the profile.

The particle size control section averages over 18 percent clay, the 13 to 58 cm layer averages about 27 percent clay and the 58 to 100 cm layer averages about 10 percent clay.

5/1990: Classification changed. Former classification: medial, nonacid, mesic Mollic Andaquepts.

3/2003: The superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document was not updated.

4/2022: Updated the soil textures with diatomaceous modifiers for all silty textures. Added an ashy modifier to the C1 horizon.

Further investigation is needed to confirm fine-silty (vs. coarse silty) particle-size class, and to confirm that Aquandic subgroup criteria are met; lab data from other Tulana pedons are inconclusive with regard to Aquandic subgroup criteria.
