TAPCO SERIES

The Tapco series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Tapco soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees  F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, thermic, shallow Duric Petroargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Tapco very gravelly clay loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Subangular and rounded gravel covers about 80 percent of the surface.

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very gravelly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (l to 4 inches thick)

    Bt--3 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and medium tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Btk--8 to 18 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; many faint clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel; few fine calcium carbonate threads and soft masses; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--18 to 26 inches; pink (5YR 7/3), pinkish white (5YR 8/2) and white (5YR 8/1) indurated silica-lime cemented hardpan with thin laminar layer on the surface, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) and pink (7.5YR 8/4) moist; massive; extremely hard; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

    2Bkkm--26 to 60 inches; pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) calcium carbonate-cemented sand, gravel and cobble, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard; 85 percent gravel and cobble; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tapco soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in gravelly fine-textured, mixed alluvium.  Elevations are 2,900 to 5,000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mingus soils.  Mingus soils have a duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to medium runoff; slow to very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and homesites.  Vegetation is tobosa, mesquite, catclaw acacia, turpentinebush and filaree.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Arizona.  The soils are moderately extensive.  MLRAs  38 & 41.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)

Argillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 18 inches (Bt, Btk horizons)
