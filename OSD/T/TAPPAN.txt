TAPPAN SERIES

The Tappan series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. These soils formed in calcareous loamy till over dense calcareous loamy till. They are on wave-worked till plains and water-lain moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Epiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tappan loam, on a 0 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 178 meters. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Ap--0 to 25 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; few fine roots; about 1 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (25 to 36 cm thick) 

    Bg--25 to 43 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; friable; few fine roots; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron accumulation; about 3 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 69 cm thick)

    Cg--43 to 91 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam; weak fine angular blocky fragments; firm; common light gray (10YR 7/1) masses of geogenic calcium carbonate in cracks; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron accumulation; about 3 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 86 cm thick)

    Cd1--91 to 97 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam; massive; very firm; about 4 percent gravel; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. 

    Cd2--97 to 152 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam; massive; very firm; about 4 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar series include the Barry, Brookston, Kilmanagh, Parkhill, and Pell Creek series. None of these soils have carbonates within 25 cm of the soil surface. Barry and Brookston soils do not have densic materials within the series control section and have argillic horizons. Kilmanagh and Parkhill soils have an ochric epipedon. Pell Creek soils do not have densic material within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tappan soils formed in calcareous loamy till over dense calcareous loamy till on nearly level areas and depressions on wave-worked till plains and water-lain moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 720 to 960 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 135 to 210 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Avoca, Corunna, Londo, and Poseyville soils. The somewhat poorly drained Londo soils are in a drainage sequence with Tappan soils. The somewhat poorly drained Avoca and Poseyville soils are on low knolls and have sandy materials in the upper part of the subsoil. The poorly drained Corunna soils are on similar landform positions and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm above the surface to 25 cm below the surface between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low in the upper part and very low in the dense till. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, sugar beets, beans, and small grains are the principal crops.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 99 in the east-central part of Lower Michigan. These soils are extensive, with about 265,000 acres of the series mapped.
