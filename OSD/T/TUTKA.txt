TYPE LOCATION: Lower Kenai Peninsula Area, Alaska; about 2 miles south of Nanwalek, feet south and 100 feet east of the NW corner of section 11, T. 10S., R. 16W., Seward Meridian; USGS Seldovia B-6 quadrangle; lat. 59 degrees 17 minutes 10 seconds N. and long. 151 degrees 55 minutes 36 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F.

Solum thickness: soil surface to bedrock
Depth to bedrock ranges: 6 to 20 inches from mineral soil surface
Coarse fragment content (weighted average): 20 to 30 percent

O horizon:
Matrix color: value of 2 to 4; chroma of 2 to 4
Reaction class: extremely acid to very strongly acid

E and Eb horizons:
Matrix color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Smeariness: weakly or moderately smeary throughout
Reaction class: extremely acid to very strongly acid

The Bhs horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4
Texture: mucky silt loam, mucky very fine sandy loam with 0 to 14 percent gravel
Total organic carbon content: is presumed to be 6 to 12 percent
Reaction class: extremely acid to very strongly acid

The 2Bhsb horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5YR or 5YR value of 3 or 4, chroma of 0 to 3

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Nakochna series. Nakochna soils cryoturbation properties.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: silty mantle of volcanic ash over glacial till underlain by bedrock
Landform: mountain slopes
Slopes: range from 8 to 120 percent
Elevations are 20 to 1500 feet
Climate: maritime with mild winters and cool summers
Mean January temperature: 23 degrees F.
Mean July temperature: 52 degrees F.
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 39 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 70 140 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Chenega, Jakolof, Koyuktolik, Kasitsna, and Seldovia soils. Chenega soils do not have spodic horizons, are sandy-skeletal, and are on floodplains. Jakolof soils are on stream terraces. Koyuktolik soils are formed in organic matter accumulated in depressions. Kasitsna soils occur on glacial moraines and in complex with Seldovia and Tutka soils on mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, low to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, subsistence, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Tutka soils have native vegetation of Sitka spruce, devils club, alder, fern, and bluejoint grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 223 Cook Inlet Mountains. Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. The series is of moderate extent.
