TRUXTON SERIES

The Truxton series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in mixed alluvium and have slopes of 1 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torriorthents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Truxton loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

	A1--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick) 

	A2--2 to 5 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick) 

	Bw1--5 to 34 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 35 inches thick) 

	Bw2--34 to 60 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine prismatic structure parting to weak fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). 

TYPE LOCATION: Mohave County, Arizona; 4 miles southeast of Truxton; 2,000 feet north and 100 feet west of the southeast corner of section 19, T.24 N., R.11 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February. Driest during May and June. Ustic aridic soil moisture regime. 

Soil Temperature: 57 to 59 degrees F. 

Rock Fragments: 0 to 5 percent gravel 

Reaction: slightly to moderately alkaline 

Clay Content: less than 18 percent 

Value: 5 or 6 dry 

Chroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Keota (CO), Mitchell (NE), and Walkibout (NM) series. Keota soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches and a component of volcanic ash and glass in the control section. Mitchell soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Walkibout soils have 10 to 25 percent mica in the coarse silt to fine sand fraction, have hue redder than 10YR, and have a soil temperature of 52 to 54 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Truxton soils are on flood plains at elevations of 4,200 to 4,700 feet. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes are 1 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 55 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 200 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pastern and Milok soils. Pastern soils are shallow to a hardpan. Milok soils have a calcic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability; rare to frequent flooding. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is snakeweed, buffalo grass, blue grama and sand dropseed. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona. The series is of small extent.  MLRA is 35.
