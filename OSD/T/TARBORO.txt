     Bw1--8 to 26 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loamy sand; weak medium granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; common fine flakes of mica and medium opaque grains; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     Bw2--26 to 40 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) loamy sand; weak medium granular structure; very friable; few fine roots; few fine flakes of mica and common medium opaque grains; moderately acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 0 to 48 inches.)

     C1--40 to 57 inches; yellow (10YR 7/6) sand; single grained; loose; few fine flakes of mica and common medium opaque grains; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.

     C2--57 to 82 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) sand; single grained; loose; few fine flakes of mica and common medium opaque grains; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

     C3--82 to 100 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) coarse sand; single grained; loose; few fine flakes of mica and common medium opaque grains; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Edgecombe County, North Carolina; 2.5 miles west of Tarboro on U.S. Highway 64; 0.2 mile northwest on SR 1207; 2.0 miles north on farm road and 50 feet northeast of road in field.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the base of the sandy deposits.: greater than 80 inches
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 80 inches
Depth to Seasonal High Water Table: greater than 72 inches
Soil Reaction: strongly acid through slightly acid, except where limed
Other Features: silt plus clay content in the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 5 to 20 percent with less than 8 percent clay 
Other Features: flakes of mica range from few to common in the B and C horizons 

RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:

A or Ap horizon (if it occurs):
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- loamy sand, loamy fine sand or sand 

Bw horizon (if it occurs):
Colorhue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 or 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- loamy sand, loamy fine sand or sand 

BC horizon (if it occurs):
Colorpaler than hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 or 8
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- loamy sand, loamy fine sand or sand 

C horizon:
Color--hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Colors become paler with increasing depth in many pedons.  The chroma 2 colors are of uncoated sand grains and are not a redoxymorhphic feature
Texture (fine-earth fraction)-- loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand. Coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, and gravelly layers are in the substrata of some pedons 

COMPETING SERIES:
Assateague soilsexcessively drained, silt plus clay in the control section is less than 5 percent 
Buncombe soils-- have C horizons that typically have loamy textures below a depth of 40 inches and are on flood plains 
Crevasse soils-- excessively drained, do not have a Bw horizon, and typically are less acid 
Malden soils-- excessively drained, have more fine and very fine sand, and typically have more weatherable minerals 
Peveto soils-- have neutral to moderately alkaline reaction 
Rolesville soils-moderately deep to hard bedrock

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
  Landscape: Coastal Plain
  Landform: stream terraces, marine terraces

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Edgecombe County, North Carolina; 1976.

REMARKS: Tarboro soils were formerly included in the Buncombe and Molena series.  However, Buncombe soils may have loamy strata below a depth of 40 inches, and Molena soils have an argillic horizon.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 80 inches
