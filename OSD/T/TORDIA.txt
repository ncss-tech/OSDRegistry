TORDIA SERIES

The Tordia series consists of soils that are deep to weathered mudstone and 
Sandstone from sediments like the Jackson Group. They are well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey material over materials weathered from mudstone and sandstone containing volcanic ash and shards. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on side slopes, shoulders and summits of broad interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coy, Dosrios, Esseville, Fashing (TX),Monteola and Weigang (TX) series.  Coy soils: are at slightly lower elevations and they have Bt horizons. Dosrios and Monteola soils: are very deep soils on similar surfaces.Esseville soils: are moderately deep to densic materials and have a gypsic horizon within 100 cmFashing and Weigang soils: are at higher elevations and are shallow to densic or paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is 
low on 0 to 1 percent slopes, medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, high on 3 to 5 
percent slopes, and very high on 5 to 8 percent slopes. Water enters the soil 
rapidly when it is dry and cracked, and very slowly when it is moist.

USE AND VEGETATION: Areas are used for cropland, pastureland and rangeland. 
Cultivated crops are mostly corn, grain sorghums, cotton, and wheat. Range 
consists of Texas cupgrass, plains bristlegrass, plains lovegrass trichloris, 
sideoats grama, vine-mesquite, mesquite, agarita, and cacti, plus annual weeds 
and grasses. Pasture is mainly coastal bermudagrass. The ecological site is Rolling Blackland 18-25 PZ(RO83A***)

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Rio Grande Plain of Texas (MLRA 83A). The series is of moderate extent.
