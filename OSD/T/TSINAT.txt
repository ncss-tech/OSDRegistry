TSINAT SERIES

The Tsinat series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to duripan. Tsinat soils formed in alluvium derived from reworked loess, volcanic ash, and basalt. They are on summits of plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tsinat soils are on summits of plateaus.  They formed in eolian material derived from Quaternary loess, volcanic ash, and pumice and alluvium derived from reworked loess and Tertiary basalt. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Calabasas, Medrano, Tetilla, and Churipa soils. Calabasas soils are deep to petrocalcic horizons, are fine-silty, and occur on summits of plateaus. Medrano soils are shallow to duripans, are loamy-skeletal, and occur on cinder cones. Tetilla soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches, do not have cemented pans, and occur on toeslopes of plateaus. Churipa soils are shallow to petrocalcic horizons, do not have calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders of plateaus.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low surface runoff; moderately slow permeability in the upper part and very slow permeability in the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tsinat soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation. The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black grama, sand dropseed, ring muhly, galleta, sideoats grama, threeawn, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Cinder(R036XB117NM)..

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tsinat soils are of small extent on the southcentral Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 36.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 2 to 21 inches (Btk horizons)
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 54 inches.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006..

ADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location has been sampled for the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S99NM-049-15.

Note: This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in either the coarse silt or very fine sand fractions within 75 cm of the soil surface. It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony. In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low. Tsinat soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.
