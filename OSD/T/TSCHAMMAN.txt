TSCHAMMAN SERIES

The Tschamman series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils on basalt plateaus and mesas.  Tschamman soils formed in loess and are underlain by basalt.  Permeability is very slow. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Chromic Durixererts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tschamman very stony silty clay loam - rangeland at an elevation of 5,150 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bss1--3 to 14 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium and coarse angular blocky and subangular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots in cracks; few fine very fine tubular pores; intersecting slickensides and pressure faces; 2 percent gravel; 1 cm wide cracks; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (7 to 15 inches thick)

    Bss2--14 to 26 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silty clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong coarse prismatic structure parting to strong medium and coarse angular blocky and subangular blocky; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots in cracks; few fine very fine tubular pores; intersecting slickensides and pressure faces; 2 percent gravel; 1 cm wide cracks; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

    Bss3--26 to 30 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) clay, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; strong fine and medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots in cracks; few fine very fine tubular pores; intersecting slickensides and pressure faces; 2 percent gravel; 1 cm wide cracks; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bqm--30 to 43 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) indurated duripan, brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; few very fine, fine, few fine and very fine roots matted at the top of the horizon;  2 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent stones (cemented into the duripan); silica cap (l mm thick) is underlain by strongly cemented material; abrupt broken boundary.  (1 to 15 inches thick)

    2R--43 inches; basalt bedrock

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Peasley series.  Peasley soils have a weakly cemented duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tschamman soils are on basalt plateaus and mesas.  Tschamman soils are underlain by basalt and developed in loess.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 3,900 to 5,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 90 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hobby soils on ridges and the Bray soils in concave positions.  Hobby soils are moderately deep to bedrock and lack a duripan.  Bray soils have an ochric epipedon and an argillic horizon and do not crack.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is rapid; permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tschamman soils are used for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is low sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Tschamman soils are of moderate extent in south central Idaho.
