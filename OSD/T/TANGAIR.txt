TANGAIR SERIES

The Tangair series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand and sandy marine terrace deposits. Tangair soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 390 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, isomesic Durinodic Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Tangair soils in an area of Tangair sand on a slope of 1 percent facing north at an elevation of 122 meters under a cover of chamise, black sage, California sage, coyotebrush, mock heather, monkeyflower, and poison oak. (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 10 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse granular structure; loose; common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; layer of white sand grains on surface; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 15 cm thick)

 A2--10 to 60 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) dry and moist sand; massive; loose; few fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; moderately coherent concretions 2 to 5 millimeters across make up 1/2 percent of mass, uniformly distributed, reddish brown (5YR 5/4 and 6/4) moist; a few reddish sand grains; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (38 to 60 cm thick)

 Bcs1--60 to 90 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; single grained; loose; few fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; concretions make up 5 to 15 percent of mass; 1 to 2 percent of sand grains are light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) moist; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); gradual smooth boundary. (20 to 38 cm thick)

 Bcs2--90 to 120 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; single grained; loose; very few fine roots in upper portion; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 to 35 percent concretions, reddish brown and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4 to 5YR 4/4), (5YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/4) moist, 12 to 150 mm across, shell of concretions redder than interior, small concretions and interior of larger ones have higher chroma and are softer, concretions in Bcs1 similar to the preceding; concretions are very hard when dry; 1 to 2 percent of sand grains are light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) moist; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); gradual wavy boundary. (20 to 38 cm thick)

 C--120 to 150 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) sand, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; single grained; loose; many very fine interstitial pores; few reddish sand grains; very few soft bodies similar to concretions in Bcs1 and Bcs2 horizons; strongly acid (pH 5.2).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Santa Barbara County (Santa Ynez Area), California, 1927.

REMARKS: Tangair soils were formerly classified as Ground-Water Podzols.
The temperature regime and classification were updated in August 2024 using the Thirteenth Edition of Soil Taxonomy during the initial mapping of Vandenberg Space Force Base. This series was formerly classified as mixed, thermic Aquic Durinodic Xeropsamments.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 60 cm
Durinodes: the zone from 60 to 120 cm
