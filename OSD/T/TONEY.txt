TONEY SERIES

Toney series consists of moderately deep, moderately well-drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff. The Toney soils are on tablelands.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Paleargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Toney extremely cobbly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface has about 60 percent cover of cobbles.

   A1--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine, and many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; 60 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 10 cm thick)

   A2--5 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) when moist; gray (10YR 6/1) spots, moderate thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and many very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; many bleached sand grains; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 cm thick)

   Bt1--10 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay, brown (10YR 4/3) when moist; strong medium columnar structure, with a light gray (10YR 7/1) bleached sand grain capping; extremely hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and common very fine exped roots; common very fine tubular pores; many pressure cutans on faces of peds and many faint clay films in pores; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 33 cm thick)

   Bt2--30 to 46 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial, and common very fine tubular pores; many pressure cutans on faces of peds and many faint clay films in pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (6 to 25 cm thick)

   Btk--46 to 58 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and tubular pores; common distinct clay films in pores, few faint and distinct clay films on faces of peds; strongly effervescent; many fine very pale brown (10YR 8/2) lime veins and filaments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

   Cr--58 to 76 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) tuff, with many white (10YR 8/1) pumiceous flecks, brown (10YR 5/3) when moist; massive; very hard, very firm; few very fine roots along fracture planes; many thin brown (10YR 5/3) clay films along fractures; many faint black (10YR 2/1) coatings on fracture faces; matrix is noneffervescent with few fine lime veins and filaments along fracture planes; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION: Washoe County, Nevada; about 1,200 feet west and 1,500 feet north of the southeast corner of section 22, T. 43 N., R.18 E.; latitude 41 degrees, 37 minutes, 46 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees, 56 minutes, 58 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.6294444 latitude, -119.9494444 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to paralithic contact: 50 to 100 cm.
Other features: Abrupt clay increase of 15 percent or more within a vertical distance of 2.5 cm or less between the A and Bt horizon. Linear extensibility is 6 cm or more.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 40 to 60 percent

A horizons
Value: 4 through 7 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Chroma: 1 or 2.

Bt horizons
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma: 2 through 4.
Texture: Clay or silty clay.
Structure: Columnar or prismatic in the upper part, prismatic, angular blocky or subangular blocky in the lower part.

Btk horizon
Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.
Value: 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma: 3 through 6.
Texture: Clay or silty clay.
Reaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Other features: Few, common or many pressure faces or slickensides; some pedons have few wedge-shaped aggregates.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent. Common or many fine or medium soft lime masses.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goldaho and Zoesta series.

Goldaho and Zoesta soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toney soils are on tuffaceous tablelands. They formed in residuum derived from tuff.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,135 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 meters; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 80 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Catnip, Home Camp, Karlo, Newlands and Ninemile soils. Catnip soils have very-fine control sections and lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Home Camp, Ninemile and Newlands soils have mollic epipedons and are underlain by hard bedrock. Karlo soils lack argillic horizons and have vertical cracks that extend to the soil surface.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well-drained; medium runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is dominantly low sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Washoe County, Nevada, and adjacent areas of California and Oregon. The series is of small extent. MLRA 23.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Washoe County, Nevada, 1974.

REMARKS: Type location is moved from Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California and Nevada, to Washoe County, Nevada, North Part to better represent the concept of the series. March, 2004.
Toney soils were formerly classified as Brown soils.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).
Argillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 58 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons).
Paralithic contact - The boundary at 58 cm (Cr layer).
Vertic subgroup - Many pressure cutans and linear extensibility of 6 cm or more (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).
Abrupt boundary - The boundary at 10 cm (A2-Bt1 boundary).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 58 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons).
