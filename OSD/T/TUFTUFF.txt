TUFTUFF SERIES

The Tuftuff series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived from tuff.  These strongly sloping to steep soils are on mountain flanks and bases.  Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.

USGS Organ Peak topographic quadrangle; latitude 32 degrees, 17 minutes, 03 seconds north and longitude 106 degrees 34 minutes 23 seconds west.  UTM zone 13S, 351853E, 3572834N; NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture: usually dry in some or in all parts for six-tenths or more of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Some part of the epipedon is moist for more than 90 cumulative days in most years when the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Mean annual soil temperature: 59 to 62 degrees F.

Depth to lithic contact: 21 to 40 inches

Depth to argillic horizon: 12 to 20 inches

Thickness of mollic epipedon: 20 to 34 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):

Clay content: 18 to 35 percent

Coarse fragment content: 60 to 75 percent

Reaction: slightly acid to neutral

A horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 1 to 4 dry, 1 to 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3, dry or moist
Coarse fragments: tuff fragments; 35 to 65 percent total fragments; 20 to 65 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.

Bt horizons:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 3 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Texture modifier: very gravelly or extremely gravelly
Coarse fragments: tuff fragments; 45 to 75 percent total coarse fragments; 35 to 65 percent gravel; 10 to 30 percent cobbles.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Overlook (AZ) series. The Overlook soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: Colluvium from tuff.
Landform: Mountain flanks and bases
Slope: 5 to 35 percent
Mean annual temperature: 58 to 61 degrees
Mean annual precipitation: 13 to 15 inches
Precipitation pattern: precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
Frost-free period: 140 to 180 days
Elevation: 4,700 to 6,300 feet

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Silktassel, Thaad, Arbol, Reduff and Crotalus soils.  
Silktassel, Arbol, and Reduff soils are shallow to bedrock and are on mountain tops and flanks.
Thaad soils have a slightly moister control section and are on mountain flanks and bases.
Crotalus soils have calcic horizons and are on mountain flanks and bases.   

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderate.  Runoff is medium on slopes of 5 to 20 percent, high on slopes of 20 to 35 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation is of the montane shrubland type consisting of hairy grama, blue grama, sideoats grama, prairie junegrass, muhly spp., alligator juniper, and Rhus spp.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern New Mexico; LRR D MLRA 42. The series is of small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 17 to 36 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)

Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 30 inches. (A1, A2, A3 and Bt1 horizons).

Argillic horizon: The zone from 17 to 36 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Aridic feature: Soil has an ustic moisture regime that borders on the aridic moisture regime.

The assignment of the cation exchange capacity is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
