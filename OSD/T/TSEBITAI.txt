TSEBITAI SERIES

The Tsebitai series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from siltstone and sandstone.  Tsebitai soils are on fan terraces below mesas, cuestas and buttes.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Tsebitai very fine sandy loam -- on a fan terrace sloping 3 percent to the north at 5,340 feet elevation -- rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described, the soil was dry throughout.)

(2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw1--5 to 16 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary.

(8 to 20 inches thick)

    BCky--34 to 48 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gypsiferous loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; secondary gypsum segregated in few fine filaments; strongly effervescent, secondary calcium carbonates segregated in few fine filaments; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 15 inches thick)

    Cy--48 to 64 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gypsiferous loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak very coarse platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; secondary gypsum segregated in few fine filaments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tsebitai soils are on fan terraces below mesas, cuestas, and buttes. Tsebitai soils formed in alluvium derived from Cretaceous siltstone and sandstone.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fordbutte, Littlehat, Nataani, Persayo, and Ravola series.  Fordbutte, Littlehat, and Nataani soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock on adjacent bedrock uplands.  Persayo soils are shallow to soft bedrock. Ravola soils are fine-silty, lack diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains and alluvial fans.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tsebitai soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is Indian ricegrass, alkali sacaton, sand dropseed, galleta, and Castle Valley clover.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tsebitai soils are of small extent (about 6,000 acres) on the Four Corners Platform portion of the Colorado Plateau province in northwest New Mexico and possibly southwest Colorado. MLRA 35.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: San Juan County, New Mexico, Shiprock Area Soil Survey, 1993.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches.  (A horizon)

Cambic horizon - The zone from 5 to 26 inches.  (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.
Tsebitai is the common Navajo word for the Ship Rock, and means "rock with wings".  It is pronounced Say'-bi-tie.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location was sampled for full characterization by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon S86NM-045-013. Salinity values were determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.  These pedons were also wet sieved to determine percent coarser than very fine sand within the control sections.  Calcium carbonate equivalence was also determined with a field volume calcimeter.
