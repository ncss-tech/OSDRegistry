TWINLAKE SERIES

The Twinlake series consists of shallow, well drained soils on backslopes and ridges of mountains.  Twinlake soils formed in colluvium from argillite and rhyolite with an influence of ash. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, isotic Lithic Haplocryepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Twinlake very gravelly ashy sandy loam - woodland, on a 60 percent eastfacing slope at an elevation of 6,900 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 5 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium and coarse roots; few fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

  Bw--5 to 14 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) extremely gravelly ashy sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine, medium, and coarse roots; 40 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy to irregular boundary. (6 to 17 inches thick)

  R--14 inches; argillite
