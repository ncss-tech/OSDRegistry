TIEVILLE SERIES

The Tieville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in calcareous clayey alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Vertic Endoaquolls

Flooding--rare flooding for brief to long periods during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas have been drained by surface ditches and are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, and small grains. Some areas are in native range. See Additional Data for native vegetative cover in Iowa and Nebraska.
