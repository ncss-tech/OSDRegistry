TUSHER SERIES

The Tusher series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and/or eolian sands derived from sedimentary rocks.  Tusher soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, fan remnants, stream terraces, or structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

The Green River soils have a water table at 20 to 60 inches in depth, and are under Fremont Cottonwoods.  The Glenton soils have less salinity and sodocity and are under basin big sagebrush.  The Toddler soils are fine-loamy and are under black greasewood.  The Chipeta soils are shallow to weathered shale and are on shale hills under mat saltbush.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cultivated areas are used for growing alfalfa, grains and pasture.  Vegetation on rangeland is shadscale, galleta, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread grass, fourwing saltbush, globemallow and winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Utah; LRR D, MLRA 34B; moderate extent.
