MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Surry County, North Carolina; 2003. 

REMARKS: Toast soils were previously mapped as Wedowee soils. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Toast series as a mesic counterpart to the Wedowee series. 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 23 inches (Bt horizon)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 8 to 29 inches (Bt and BC horizons). CEC/clay ratio by ammonium acetate at pH 7.0 is 14.3 cmol (weighted average). 
Other soil features identified with this pedon:
Series control section--0 to 60 inches
