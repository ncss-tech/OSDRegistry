TERLOUGH SERIES

The Terlough series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low terraces of mountain valley floors.  Terlough soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Terlough gravelly silt loam - conifer forest, on 0 percent slope at elevation of 3,840 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)

  Oi--0 to 1 inches; slightly decomposed plant material consisting of leaves, needles, moss, twigs and logs

  A--1 to 9 inches; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) gravelly silt loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, common medium and few coarse roots; few fine tubular and few very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary

  AB--9 to 14 inches; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) very gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine, medium and coarse roots; few fine tubular and very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 5 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.  (A and AB horizons combined are 10 to 20 inches thick)

  Bw--14 to 25 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; single grain; loose, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium and few coarse roots; common very fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (10 to 29 inches thick)

  C--25 to 61 inches; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine, few very fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5).
