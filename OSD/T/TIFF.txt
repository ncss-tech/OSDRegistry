TIFF SERIES 

The Tiff series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed clayey residuum on uplands.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep areas that have been truncated by mining operations.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, kaolinitic, mesic Rhodic Paleudalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tiff gravelly clay - on a convex escarpment of 13 percent slope in a mined area at an elevation of 710 feet. 

   Bt1--0 to 8 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) gravelly clay; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) dry; moderate medium angular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; very firm; many fine and medium roots, and common coarse roots; many very fine and fine vesicular and tubular pores; common distinct clay films (cutans) on faces of peds; 23 percent chert gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

   Bt2--8 to 29 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) very cobbly clay; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) dry; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; very firm; common medium and coarse roots, and common fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular and tubular pores; many distinct clay films (cutans) on faces of peds; 27 percent chert gravel; 20 percent chert cobbles; few fine prominent black masses of manganese or iron-manganese accumulation; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

   Bt3--29 to 53 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) gravelly clay; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) dry; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; very firm; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; many distinct clay films (cutans) on faces of peds; 23 percent chert gravel; few fine prominate black masses of manganese or iron-manganese accumulation; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

   Bt4--53 to 80 inches; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) clay; dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) dry; moderate fine angular blocky structure; very firm; common very fine and fine vesicular and tubular pores; many distinct clay films (cutans) on faces of peds; 8 chert gravel; few fine prominate masses of manganese or iron-manganese accumulation; strongly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  Tiff is the only series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tiff soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands that have been truncated by strip mining operations.  They formed in clayey residuum.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Goss, Courtois, Weingarten and Hildebrecht soils.  Goss soils are not truncated and are on adjacent hill slopes.  Courtois soils are in the fine family and are on ridgetops.  Weingarten soils are in the fine-silty family and are on ridgetops.  Hildebrecht soils are in the fine-silty family, have a fragipan, and are on ridgetops. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is low to high. Permeability is moderately slow. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are abandoned strip mines.  These areas were mined for barite and have been allowed to revegetate naturally. Cedars, hardwoods, grasses, and forbs are the dominant species present. A few areas have been reclaimed and planted to domestic grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The eastern part of the Ozarks Border Area (MLRA 116B) of Missouri where strip mining occurred.  The series is of moderate extent.
