TRUESDALE SERIES

The Truesdale series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils on level to sloping terraces and basalt plains.  They formed in alluvium or lacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 51
degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xereptic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Truesdale fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable; nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots;
slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 18 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; slightly effervescent; slightly
alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bk--18 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm; many very fine and fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent hard (cicada) krotovinas 0.5 to 1.5 inches across with lime splotches and coatings on the surface; few fine lime veins throughout; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bkqm--24 to 32 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) duripan, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, very firm, 3 to 5 thin (less than 2 mm) horizontal lenses of strong lime-silica cementation 0.5 to 3 inches apart and concentrated in the upper part; matrix weakly cemented and does not slake in HC1, but becomes friable; 30 percent of nodules or (cicada) krotovinas; few roots between plates; many very fine tubular
pores; violently effervescent with many lime splotches and veins; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    2Bk--32 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine tubular pores; violently effervescent with common lime veins; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5).

TYPE LOCATION:  Canyon County, Idaho; about 3.5 miles east of Homedale; 1880 feet west and 440 feet north of the SE corner section 5, T.3N., R.4W.
Latitude - 43 degrees, 37 minutes, 04 seconds North;

Average annual soil temperature - 49 to 54 degrees F
Depth to strongly to weakly cemented duripan - 20 to 40 inches
Depth to bedrock - 50 to over 60 inches
Depth to the calcic horizon (Bk) - 11 to 21 inches
Texture in particle-size control section - FSL, SL, COSL, GR-SL; total clay content is 10 to 18 percent, carbonate free clay is 5 to 15 percent.

A horizon
Value - 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist

Bk horizon
Value - 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist

Calcium carbonate content - 15 to 40 percent
Reaction - moderately or strongly alkaline

2Bk horizon
Texture - SL, SIL, L
Rock fragments - 0 to 25 percent
Reaction - moderately or strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bliss, Eltopis, and Kodra series.  These soils lack a calcic horizon above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Truesdale soils are in level to sloping medium and high terraces and basalt plains at elevations of 2,200 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium or lacustrine sediments of mixed mineralogy and may have some eolian admixture.  Average annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches, including
0.5 to 2 feet of snow, and the average annual air temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cencove, Letha, Minidoka, Nyssa, and Sagehill soils.  Cencove soils have contrasting textures and lack duripans.  Nyssa soils are coarse-silty.  Sagehill soils lack duripans.  Letha soils have high exchangeable sodium, lack a duripan, and are on low terraces.  Minidoka, Cencove, and Nyssa soils are on landscape positions similar to Truesdale soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability above the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for rangeland and irrigated cropland.  Principal crops are small grain, potatoes, vegetables, corn, sugar beets, alfalfa, pasture grasses, and a few orchards.  Vegetation in the potential natural plant community is Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Thurber needlegrass, and Sandberg
bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho and eastern Oregon.  The series is moderately extensive.
