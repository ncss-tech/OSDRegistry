TRINCHERA SERIES

The Trinchera series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  Trinchera soils are on outwash plains and outwash fans. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.
