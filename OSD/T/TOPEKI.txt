TOPEKI SERIES

The Topeki series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite. Topeki soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Mean annual temperature is 5 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Lithic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Topeki extremely stony loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The surface is covered with approximately 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 20 percent stones, and 3 percent boulders.

    A1--0 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) extremely stony loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    A2--13 to 30 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely stony loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine through medium roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; 20 percent cobbles and 45 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

    C--30 to 38 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely stony loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and 45 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

    R--38 cm, hard fractured quartzite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  White Pine County, Nevada; about 2 miles north of Bald Mountain in Great Basin National Park, between Strawberry Creek and Windy Canyon; USGS Windy Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 02 minutes 52 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 19 minutes 35 seconds W; UTM Zone 11, 731375e, 4325475n, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in the moisture control section in winter, spring, and early summer, dry in all parts 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice (July and August), but intermittently moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to convection storms between July and September; xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 4 to 7 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature: 8 to 10 degrees C.
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 18 to 38 cm.
Depth to bedrock: 25 to 50 cm.
Profile reaction: Slightly acid or moderately acid. Some pedons have thin A1 horizons that are neutral.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 25 percent.
Rock fragments: Average 60 to 85 percent, dominantly cobbles and stones.

A horizons
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.

C horizon (Where present)
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arrowpeak, Cheadle, Chokecherry, Clamp, Dalys, Dollarhide, Eyre, Irigul, Irson, Jonlake, Labshaft, Milling, Poin, Rogert, Schwacheim, Starley, and Udel series.  

Arrowpeak soils have mean annual soils temperature of 2.8 to 5 degrees C and contain 10 to 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Cheadle soils have Bk horizons. Chokecherry soils have 10 to 18 percent clay on the particle-size control section. Clamp soils have bedrock between depth of 10 to 30 cm.  Dalys soils are 7 to 25 cm deep to lithic contacts.  Dollarhide soils have less than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control sections.  Eyre soils have less than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control sections.  Irigul soils have rock fragments that are mostly channers and have MSST of 12 to 15 degrees C.  
Irson soils have mean annual soil temperature of 0 to 1.7 degrees C., rock fragments dominated by igneous rocks and mollic epipedon thickness of 15 to 30 cm.  Jonlake soils contain coarse fragments that are mainly gravel-size.  Labshaft soils have 40 to 70 percent rock fragments that are mainly gravel and have MSST of 12 to 15 degrees C, and are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer months.  Milling soils have less than 18 percent clay in their particle-size control sections.  Poin soils contain 5 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Rogert soils have 5 to 18 percent clay and an ustic soil moisture regime.  
Schwacheim soils have a udic soil moisture regime, contain coarse fragments that are mainly gravel and have 15 to 35 percent sand with textures of silt loam, silty clay loam and clay loam.Starley soils have Bk horizons.  Udel soils are less than 25 cm to bedrock and contain less than 18 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Topeki soils are on mountains and occur on backslope and crest positions. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from quartzite. Elevations are 2,080 to 3,170 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid with cold and wet winters and warm dry summers. Mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm. The frost-free season is 40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hapgood and Jonlake soils. 
Hapgood soils are very deep and have mollic epipedons over 40 cm thick.  
Jonlake soils are dominated by gravel-size rock fragments.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Topeki soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly curlleaf mountainmahogany, mountain big sagebrush, snowberry and bluebunch wheatgrass. This site is correlated to Ecological Site F28AY058NV Stony Mahogany Savanna.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. MLRA 28A. These soils are of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: White Pine County, Nevada, East Part, 2004. The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon.
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to 30 cm (A1 and A2 horizons)
Lithic Contact - The layer at 38 cm (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 38 cm (part of the A2 and C horizons)

The type location was moved from Nye County to White Pine County in 1991 and the series concept was revised slightly.
