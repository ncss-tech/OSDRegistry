TOLEX SERIES 

The Tolex series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from igneous argillite, sandstone, and metasedimentary rock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tolex channery loam, forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    0--1 inch to 0; forest litter of partially decomposed needles, twigs and roots; clear smooth boundary. (1/2 to 2 inches thick) 

    A--0 to 1 inch; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick) 

    E--1 to 5 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; gray silt and sand skeletans on faces of plates; 20 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bt--5 to 13 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and on coarse fragments; 65 percent channers; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick) 

    BC--13 to 18 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) extremely channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 85 percent channers, 5 percent flagstones; slightly effervescent on undersides of coarse fragments; neutral (pH 6.8) gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick) 

    R--18 inches; hard argillite bedrock with a few cracks; few fine roots in some cracks.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fremont County, Colorado, 1988; proposed in Lewis and Clark County, Montana, 1979. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0386, MT1010.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an O horizon 1 inch thick (Oi horizon).  An ochric epipedon from the surface to 5 inches, mixed (A, E horizons).  An argillic horizon from 5 to 13 inches (Bt horizon) that is also the particle-size control section.  Lithic bedrock at a depth of 18 inches (R horizon).  Tolex soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.

Classification changed from Lithic Eutroboralfs in 1997.
