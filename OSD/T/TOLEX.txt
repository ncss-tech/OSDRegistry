TOLEX SERIES

The Tolex series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from igneous argillite, sandstone, and metasedimentary rock.  These soils are on bedrock-floored hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tolex channery loam, forest (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oe--0 to 3 cm; forest litter of partially decomposed needles, twigs and roots; clear smooth boundary. (1 to 5 cm thick) 

    A--3 to 6 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) channery loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 20 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 cm thick) 

    E--6 to 16 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate very thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; gray silt and sand skeletans on faces of plates; 20 percent channers; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 13 cm thick) 

    Bt--16 to 36 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely channery clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine and few medium roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; continuous distinct clay films on faces of peds and on coarse fragments; 65 percent channers; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 40 cm thick) 

    BC--36 to 49 cm; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) extremely channery loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 85 percent channers, 5 percent flagstones; slightly effervescent on undersides of coarse fragments; neutral (pH 6.8) gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick) 

    R--49 cm; hard argillite bedrock with a few cracks; few fine roots in some cracks.
