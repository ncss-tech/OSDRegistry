TISHTANG SERIES

The Tishtang series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from diorite. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 2540 millimeters (100 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountain summits and upper slopes with slopes of 9 to 25 percent at elevations of 915 to 1524 meters (3002 to 5000 feet). These soils formed in residuum from diorite. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2032 to 2794 millimeters (80 to 110 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C (44 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 9 degrees C (49 degrees F), the mean winter temperature is 2 degrees C (35 degrees F), and the mean annual temperatures ranges from 5 to 8 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F). The growing season is about 75 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Darkwoods and Firmountain soils.  These soils occur on phyllite at lower elevations. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Native vegetation is white fir, Douglas-fir, incense cedar, with an understory of whitethorn ceanothus, common snowberry, and honeysuckle.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. These soils are of small extent.
