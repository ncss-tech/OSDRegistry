TILFORD SERIES

The Tilford series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in local alluvium and residuum derived from reddish siltstone and silty shale.  Tilford soils are on on backslopes and footslopes of fans, terraces, and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 445 mm (17.5 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tilford silt loam - on a north-facing slope of 4 percent in native grass.  When described the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Bw1--13 to 23 cm (5 to 9 inches); dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slight effervescence; neutral; gradual wavy boundary.

   Bw2--23 to 41 cm (9 to 16 inches); reddish brown (5YR 5/3) silt loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

   Bw3--41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 inches); reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) silt loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 15 to 63 cm.)

   Bky--66 to 100 cm (26 to 40 inches); light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium accumulations of gypsum; common fine and medium accumulations of carbonates; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline.

Mollic epipedon thickness:  18 to less than 50 cm (7 to less than 20 inches)
Depth to calcium carbonates:  0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches)
Depth to bedrock:  typically is greater than 150 cm (60 inches); weakly cemented siltstone and/or silty shale may occur between 100 and 150 cm (40 and 60 inches) in some pedons

A 2C horizon occurs between 100 and 150 cm (40 to 60 inches) in some pedons.  It has properties similar to the C horizon except textures are very gravelly and extremely gravelly loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and coarse sandy loam.  It has 35 to 60 percent rounded and subrounded gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobble, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Fragments are from mixed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary sources.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bend, Homme, Nuckolls, and Uly series.
Bend - have hue of 10YR or yellower, and have varves 1 to 2 mm in thickness in the lower part of the profile
Homme - have hue of 10YR or yellower, have free carbonates deeper than 25 cm, and lack secondary accumulations of gypsum
Nuckolls - have free carbonates deeper than 50 cm, typically do not have secondary accumulations of carbonates or gypsum, and have mean annual temperatures of 10 to 14 degrees C
Uly - have hue yellower than 7.5YR in the A and B horizons, and typically do not have secondary accumulations of carbonates or gypsum

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  silty alluvium and residuum derived from reddish-colored silty shale and siltstone, primarily of the Spearfish formation

Swint - are fine-loamy, and have an irregular decrease in organic matter; on lower landscape positions
Vale - have argillic horizons; on similar landscape positions

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage:  Well
Ksat:  moderately high
Surface runoff:  low to medium, depending on slope

USE AND VEGETATION:
Use:  native range (livestock grazing), pasture, hayland, and cropland.  Small grains, corn (where irrigated), and alfalfa are the principal crops.
Native vegetation:  little bluestem, big bluestem, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needleandthread, blue grama, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Tilford soils occur primarily in the Red Valley physiographic area of the Black Hills Foothills in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming.  LRR G, MLRA 61.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Meade County, South Dakota, 1974.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 inches); (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)
Cambic horizon - 13 to 100 cm (5 to 40 inches); (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and Bky horizons)
Secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate and gypsum - 66 to 100 cm (26 to 40 inches); (Bky horizon)

The taxonomic classification of the series is changed from Torriorthentic Haplustolls to Typic Haplustolls with this update.  The type location for the series is in the typic-ustic moisture regime in MLRA 61, and the soil has a diagnostic cambic horizon.
