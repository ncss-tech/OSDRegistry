03/1995--NSTH 17, reclassification only

08/2016--Andic soil properties were recognized in the soils based on a strong presence of andic soil properties in geographically associated soils as well as in populated data for the Clackamas County soil survey. As a result, the classification was changed from loamy-skeletal, isotic Typic Humicryods to medial-skeletal, amorphic Andic Humicryods. The soils are assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence.
