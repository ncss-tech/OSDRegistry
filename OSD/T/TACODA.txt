TACODA SERIES

The Tacoda series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains. These soils formed in sandy outwash overlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Epiaquods

TYPICAL PEDON: Tacoda sand, on a 1 percent slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 8 cm (3 inches); black (10YR 2/1) sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [2 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 E--8 to 38 cm (3 to 15 inches); light gray (10YR 7/2) sand, very pale brown (10YR 8/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; common medium and fine distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [5 to 30 cm (2 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bs--38 to 58 cm (15 to 23 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sand; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few medium distinct yellowish red (5YR 4/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches) thick]

 Bw--58 to 89 cm (23 to 35 inches); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) and light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand; single grain; loose; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 30 cm (12 inches) thick]

 BC--89 to 114 cm (35 to 45 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) sand; single grain; loose; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.

 2C1--114 to 152 cm (45 to 60 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/2) silty clay; massive with widely spaced vertical fractures; firm; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 2C2--152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) silty clay; massive with widely spaced vertical fractures; firm; common medium faint brown (7.5YR 4/2) iron depletions in the matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Iosco County, Michigan, about a half mile south of National City; 2,200 feet south and 400 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 9, T. 21 N., R. 6 E.; USGS National City topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 13 minutes 42 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 42 minutes 17 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Augwood and Flink series. Augwood and Flink soils contain less than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tacoda soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in sandy outwash overlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1  to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wakeley, Au Gres, Croswell, and Deford soils. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Wakeley and Deford soils are in depressions and along drainageways. The Au Gres soils are on similar position and lack the clayey substratum. The moderately well drained Croswell soils are on small ridges.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the solum and low in the substratum. Permeability is rapid in the solum and very slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Common trees are red pine, eastern white pine, paper birch and quaking aspen. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northern part of the lower peninsula of Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iosco County, Michigan, 1995.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 38 cm (15 inches) (A, E horizons).
Albic horizon: from a depth of 8 to 38 cm (3 to 15 inches) (E horizon).
Spodic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 58 cm (15 to 23 inches) (Bs horizon).
Aquic conditions: redoximorphic features present immediately below the surface horizon and in all underlying horizons.

Areas of these soils were previously mapped as Au Gres, clayey substratum phase.
