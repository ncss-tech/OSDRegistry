SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon 

SERIES PROPOSED: Wheeler County, Oregon; 2014

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Natric horizon--zone from 5 to 61 cm
*Ochric epipedon--zone from 0 to 5 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 5 to 55 cm
*Secondary carbonates--zone from 2 to 127 cm
*Sodium adsorption ratio--greater than 13 throughout profile

3/2015--Aquic conditions are present in subsurface horizons with both episaturation and endosaturation due to a salt-affected perched water table at a depth of 20 to 61 cm in spring. Turtlesprings name is from Turtle Cove member of John Day Formation and influence of ground-fed springs.

2/2016--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting; no major technical changes were made.
