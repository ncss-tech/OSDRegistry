TARQUIN SERIES

The Tarquin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed  colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone and conglomerate. Tarquin soils are on dissected fan remnants and hills and have slopes of 9 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These is the Tarquin soils.  Tarquin soils are formed in marine deposits on uplifted terraces.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tarquin soils occur on dissected fan remnants and side slopes of hills. Slopes are 9 to 30 percent. Elevations are 50 to 198 meters (160 to 645 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone and conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1900 to 2290 millimeters (75 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 275 to 325 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Battery, Catchings, and Copperceek  soils. Battery soils do not have redoximorphic features. Catchings soils do not have redoximorphic features and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Coppercreek soils do not have redoximorphic features and have an ochric epipedon. Battery and Catchings are at higher elevations.  Coppercreek soils are found on slightly convex and linear areas on sandstone and shale. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for wildlife, recreation and watershed. Natural vegetation consists of redwood, western hemlock, evergreen huckleberry, red huckleberry, Pacific rhododendron, cascara, salmonberry, salal, swordfern, and redwood sorrel.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: California Coastal Redwood Belt; MLRA 4B. The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California
