TIPPECANOE SERIES

The Tippecanoe series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. The Tippecanoe soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly loamy outwash. They are on outwash plains and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudolls

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corwin, Foresman, Pacer, Parr, and Prairieville series. Corwin and Parr soils have a densic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Foresman soils have sola less than 102 cm (40 inches) in thickness. Pacer soils have till in the lower part of the series control section which contains less than 15 percent rock fragments. Prairieville soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tippecanoe soils are on outwash plains and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are deep or very deep to calcareous sandy and gravelly loamy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Comfrey, Crane, Free, and Wea soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Comfrey soils have thicker mollic epipedons and are on nearby flood plains. The somewhat poorly drained Crane soils are on lower lying positions. The very poorly drained Free soils are in depressions. The well drained Wea soils are on nearby slopes and slight rises.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly cropped to corn and soybeans. Small grain and legume hay are also grown. Native vegetation is tall prairie grass, mainly big bluestem.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Indiana and Ohio; MLRAs 110, 111A, and 111D. The type location is in MLRA 110. The series is of moderate extent.
