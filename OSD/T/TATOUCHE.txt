TATOUCHE SERIES

The Tatouche series consists of deep, well drained soils that
formed in clayey colluvium weathered from tuff, breccia, and andesite.  Tatouche soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes
of 12 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tatouche gravelly loam, on a 32 percent slope
under mixed conifers at 4,300 feet elevation.  When described,
the soil was dry throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

O--2 inches to 0; litter of twigs and neddles.

A1--0 to 5 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravelly loam,
dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; strong fine and very fine
granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine
pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

A2--5 to 11 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) gravelly loam,
dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine tubular
pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)

Bt1--11 to 19 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) gravelly clay
loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) dry; moderate medium and fine
subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic;
common medium and few fine and large roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; few moderately
thick and thin clay films; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

2Bt2--19 to 34 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, dark
brown (10YR 4/4) dry; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common medium and few fine and coarse roots; many very fine tubular
pores; 10 percent weathered gravel; common moderately thick clay films; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (12 to 20 inches thick)

2Bt3--34 to 60 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, brown
(7.5YR 5/4) dry; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky
structure; very hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few
roots; many very fine tubular pores; 10 percent weathered gravel; common moderately thick clay films; moderately acid (pH 5.8);
gradual wavy boundary.  (10 to 28 inches.)

2C--60 to 73 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay loam,
yellowish brown (10YR 5/5) dry; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; 5 percent weathered gravel; common black stains;
moderately acid (pH 5.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Jackson County, Oregon; about 10 miles southeast
of Ashland along access road to north end of railroad tunnel at Siskiyou Summit; approximately 990 feet north and 1,590 feet west
of the southeast corner of sec. 20, T. 40 S., R. 2 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mean
annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 to 12 inches for
45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 10
to 30 percent rock fragments of which 10 to 20 percent is gravel
and 0 to 10 percent are cobbles and has 35 to 50 percent clay.

Th A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and
3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is slightly
acid or neutral.

The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4
moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.  It is moderately or
slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Booford, Harter, Manila,
Marsden, Ostler, Rob Roy and Shagnasty series.  Booford and Rob
Roy soils are moderately deep.  Manila, Marsden and Shagnasty
soils lack O horizons and are dry for 60 or more consecutive
days.  Ostler soils have 18 to 22 inches of precipitation and do
not have a discontinuity.  Harter soils lack an O horizon, have
18 to 25 inches of precipitation and do not have a discontinuity.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tatouche series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in clayey colluvium weathered from andesite, tuff, and breccia.  Elevation
is 3,600 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about
30 to 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees
F.  The frost-free period is less than 100 days.  Slopes range
from 12 to 65 percent.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bybee, Farva,
Hobit and Kanutchan soils.  Bybee soils are moderately well
drained and lack argillic horizons.  Farva soils are skeletal and lack argillic horizons.  Hobit soils are fine-loamy and have a
cryic soil temperature regime.  Kanutchan soils are poorly
drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.
USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are used for timber production, water supply, wildlife, and recreation.  Native vegetation includes
Douglas fir, white fir, incense cedar, shrubs, and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Cascades of southwestern
Oregon.  The soils are of limited extent.
