TERRIER SERIES

The Terrier series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These nearly level soils are on steam terraces and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Terrier soils are on floodplains. Slope is 0 to 4 percent. These soils formed from clayey alluvium. Elevation ranges from 3,980 to 4,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the tentative Ybar (NM), Bigsalt (NM), and Pup(NM). Ybar soils are on lower fan piedmonts and do not have salic horizons or a water table within 80 inches, Bigsalt soils are on floodplains and do not have a water table within 60 inches. Pup soils are on broad drainageways and have vertic properties.   

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; low runoff; slow permeability. Water table from 0 to 40 inches during all seasons.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is inland saltgrass, iodinebush, spreading alkaliweed and saltcedar.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, MLRA 42. Terrier is of limited extent.
