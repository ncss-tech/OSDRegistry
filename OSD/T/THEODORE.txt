SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska; 2020

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Redoximorphic iron concentrations--C2, C3, and C4 horizons
*Redoximorphic iron depletions--C4 horizon
*Irregular decrease in organic carbon content--C2, C3, and C4 horizons
All horizons within 25 cm of the mineral soil surface effervesce with 1N HCl.
Occasional flooding is the dominant condition for this series.
A positive reaction to alpha-alpha dipyridyl is assumed below 75cm in June.
