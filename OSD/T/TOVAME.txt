TOVAME SERIES

The Tovame series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils, formed in alluvium from mixed rocks on terraces on mountain valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and mean annual temperature about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tovame silt loam, moist meadow, on 0 percent slope at elevation of 4,150 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A1--0 to 6 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. 

  A2--6 to 12 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine, and few medium roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

  A3--12 to 22 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine, and few medium roots; few fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 16 to 25 inches)

  Bw--22 to 35 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick)

  C1--35 to 50 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; few fine, faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations and common medium, distinct light gray (Gley 1 7/N) redox depletions; single grain; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 25 inches thick)

  C2--50 to 61 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loamy sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).
