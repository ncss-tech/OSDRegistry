TADPOLE SERIES

The Tadpole series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash over coarse-loamy alluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent on plains. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Tadpole silt loam -- on a nearly level lava flow trough, at 2,950 feet elevation in rangeland. When described on November 3, 1999, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong fine platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.1); abrupt smooth boundary.

    A2--2 to 5 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine and fine, few medium irregular and tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (combined A horizon - 2 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 12 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine, few medium tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. ( 0 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 18 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent (about 15 percent CaC03); calcium carbonate is disseminated throughout the peds; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. ( 3 to 24 inches thick)

    Bkq--18 to 38 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 40 percent strongly cemented durinodes; violently effervescent (about 25 percent CaC03); calcium carbonate is disseminated throughout the peds; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary. (12 to 24 inches thick)

    2C--38 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; violently effervescent (about 20 percent CaC03); calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9).

Some pedons have buried thin layers with continuous silica cementation below 40 inches

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. The Chijer and Portneuf soils are similar, but both have a soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tadpole soils are on plug domes, pressure ridges, lava flow lobes and troughs on shield volcanoes of plains.  Elevations are 2,800 to 3,550 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in loess and weathered volcanic ash over coarse-loamy alluvium from basalt and volcanic ash. Average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. Average annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 130 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Laped, Purdam, Scism, Trevino and Weso soils. Purdam, Scism and Trevino soils have a soil moisture regime that borders on xeric. Laped and Trevino soils are less than 20 inches deep. Weso soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Landscape positions are similar.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tadpole soils are used mainly for rangeland. Natural vegetation is shadscale saltbush, bud sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, Thurber needlegrass and on saline areas winterfat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Ada and Elmore Counties, Idaho; MLRA 11. These soils are of limited extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:

Ochric epipedon - zone from the surface to 5 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)

Cambic horizon - zone from 5 to 12 inches (Bw horizon)

Calcic horizon - zone from 12 to 38 inches (Bk and Bkq horizons)

Particle-size control section - zone from 10 to 40 inches 

Soil moisture regime - aridic

More investigation of the chemical characteristics of the saline phase of this series is needed to determine what relationship the higher EC values have to the winterfat plant community.
