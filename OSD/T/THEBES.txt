THEBES SERIES

The Thebes series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  They are on windblown sandy hummocks, on outwash plains, alluvial terraces, and on upland ridges adjacent to stream valleys.  These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess or other silty material and the underlying eolian loamy sand or sand.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.7 degrees C (53 degrees F).

Flagg and Hackers soils have hue of 5YR or redder in some part of the series control section.  Jackson, Jemerson, Seaton, and Stookey soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Lomira soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to the base of the argillic horizon and to carbonates. Rush soils have coarse fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Yellowriver soils average less than 50 percent sand in the underlying material.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thebes soils are on wind-blown sandy hummocks, on outwash plains, alluvial terraces, and on upland ridges adjacent to stream valleys.  Slope gradients commonly are between 5 and 15 percent but range from 1 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying eolian loamy sand or sand.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.6 to 13.3 degrees C (51 to 56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Middletown soils and Alvin soils.  Middletown soils have formed in more than 102 cm (40 inches) of loess or other silty material and are in similar positions.  Alvin soils have more sand in the particle size control section and are on similar positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained.  The potential for surface runoff is low to high.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and high to very high (41.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the loess and rapid in the underlying material.  

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used principally for growing cultivated crops.  Principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grain and meadow.  Native vegetation was hardwood trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central and northwestern Illinois, and eastern Iowa in MLRAs 108B, 113, 114B. and 115C.  The extent is moderate.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Shelby County, Illinois, 1932.

REMARKS: With this update the typical pedon is relocated to Mercer County, Illinois.  Thebes soils were previously correlated as fine-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal in Illinois and Iowa.  However, based on field investigations in Illinois and additional documentation, it is proposed, with this update, to classify the Thebes soils as fine-silty.  

This pedon was checked in the field by SLE 2/17/1998 and adjustments were made in the description on depth of soil development, colors, and redoximorphic features.  The pedon number is 84IL-131-44.

 Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
   ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon);
   argillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 79 cm (9 to 31 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
