COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bodenburg, Fairbanks, Fairless, Koyukuk, Nunaniq series. Bodenburg and Koyukuk series lack finely disseminated calcium carbonate in the subsoil. Fairbanks, Fairless, and Nunaniq soils lack sandy subsoils.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess over eolian sand
Landform: climbing dunes on back slopes of hills adjacent to flood plains
Slopes: 36 to 86 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 25 degrees F., -4 degrees C.
Mean annual precipitation: about 11 inches, 280 mm

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Eielson and Fairbanks series. Eielson soils are on floodplains and are moderately well drained.. Fairbanks soils are on hills and mountains and lack sandy suboils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: well drained, high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity moderate in the loess mantle and rapid in the eolian sand substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation includes white spruce and aspen forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 231, Interior Alaska Highlands, The series is of limited extent.
