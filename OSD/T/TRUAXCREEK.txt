TRUAXCREEK SERIES

The Truaxcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on stream terraces, flood plains and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Truaxcreek loam, in rangeland on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 2121 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   Oe--0 to 3 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) mucky peat, black (10YR 2/1) moist; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 cm thick)

   A1--3 to 13 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. 

   A2--13 to 25 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 horizons - 18 to 28 cm)

   Bw--25 to 39 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 15 cm thick) 

   Bk--39 to 82 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, very sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 5 percent soft masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (30 to 46 cm thick)

   2C--82 to 152 cm; variegated extremely gravelly sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; 60 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0).
