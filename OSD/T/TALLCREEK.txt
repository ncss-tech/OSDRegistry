TALLCREEK SERIES 

The Tallcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces, lake terraces, outwash terraces and lake plains in valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, active, frigid Vitrandic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tallcreek ashy silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A--1 to 5 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) ashy silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and many coarse roots; moderately acid (ph 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--5 to 19 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) ashy silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; slightly alkaline (ph 7.6); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bk--19 to 29 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) silt loam, olive gray (5Y 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine masses of lime; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (ph 7.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

    C1--29 to 35 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) silty clay loam varved lacustrine material, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium and coarse roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (ph 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    C2--35 to 43 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) silty clay loam varved lacustrine material, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (ph 7.4); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

    C3--43 to 60 inches; pale yellow (5Y 8/2) very fine sandy loam varved lacustrine material, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) redox concentrations; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (ph 7.4).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tallcreek soils are used for woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is mainly ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, western larch, grand fir, Engelmann spruce, white spruce, and water birch.  The understory vegetation is mainly pinegrass, twinflower, huckleberry, queencup beadlilly, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Tallcreek soils are of small extent in the valleys of northwestern Montana.
