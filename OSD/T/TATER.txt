REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 2 to 70 cm (A1, A2 and BA horizons)
*Andic soil properties--zone from 2 to 160 cm
*Particle-size control section--2 to 102 cm, with 2 to 70 cm being medial-skeletal and amorphic, and 70 to 102 cm being ashy-skeletal and amorphic.  Classification is based on the thickest part (medial-skeletal and amorphic).  Need to propose a contrasting particle-size class of medial-skeletal over ashy-skeletal with 15 bar water qualifying statement the same as used in the medial over ashy contrasting particle size class family.
