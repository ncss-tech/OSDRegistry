TREMONT SERIES

The Tremont series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in two distinct layers of loamy alluvium on flood plains. They are underlain below a depth of 102 to 183 cm (40 to 72 inches) by gravelly sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tremont silty clay loam, rarely flooded, in a nearly level area in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--18 to 33 cm (7 to 13 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak coarse and medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few medium and fine roots; few gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the A horizon is 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches).]

 Ab1--33 to 53 cm (13 to 21 inches); black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; weak fine and very fine granular structure; friable; few medium and fine roots; few gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Ab2--53 to 74 cm (21 to 29 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine angular blocky; firm; few medium and fine roots; few gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Ab horizon is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches).]

 Bgb1--74 to 94 cm (29 to 37 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium prominent olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) and light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; few black (10YR 2/1) krotovinas; about 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Bgb2--94 to 137 cm (37 to 54 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation; few black (10YR 2/1) krotovinas; about 5 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bgb horizon is 36 to 102 cm (14 to 40 inches).]

 2Cg1--137 to 163 cm (54 to 64 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam; single grain; loose; about 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.

 2Cg2--163 to 203 cm (64 to 80 inches); dark gray (10YR 4/1) very gravelly coarse sandy loam; single grain; loose; about 40 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Ohio; Mad River Township; about 130 feet north and 460 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 13, T. 3, R. 9.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Thickness of the solum: 102 to 183 cm (40 to 72 inches)
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 inches)
Thickness of the distinctly younger alluvium: 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches)
Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm (20 inches): 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 56 degrees F)
Series control section: the soil contains calcium carbonate throughout and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Ap or A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3 (3 to 5 dry)
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent

Ab horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry); 4 allowed below a depth of 61 cm (24 inches)
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent

The Ap and A horizons typically are lighter in color and have a higher calcium carbonate equivalent than the Ab horizon.

Bwb or Bgb horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 10 percent

2Bgb or 2BCb, where present below 102 cm (40 inches):
Texture: gravelly analogs of silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam
Rock fragment content: 15 to 30 percent

2Cg or 2C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: gravelly or very gravelly analogs of silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam, but some pedons have subhorizons of gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand
Rock fragment content: 15 to 59 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. In a closely related family are the Havelock and Millington series. These soils are in the superactive cation-exchange activity class. In addition, Havelock soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 91 cm (36 inches). Millington soils do not have a buried soil (Ab horizon) within the series control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tremont soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in loamy calcareous alluvium washed from soils formed in drift of late Wisconsinan glaciation. They are underlain by gravelly sediments below a depth of 102 to 183 cm (40 to 72 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 54 degree F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lippincott, Ross, and Sloan soils. The very poorly drained Lippincott soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying calcareous gravelly and sandy outwash. They are on adjacent terraces. The well drained Ross soils commonly are on higher positions than Tremont soils or are nearer to stream channels. The very poorly drained Sloan soils typically are in lower positions than Tremont soils, or are farther from stream channels.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is very low or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate. Tremont soils are subject to rare or occasional flooding during late fall to spring.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in cropland, but some are in permanent pasture or woodland. Corn and soybeans are the principal crops. Some areas are used for hay or forage crops. Native vegetation is scattered deciduous forest with prairie grasses. Sycamore, ash, elm, beech, maple and walnut were the principal woodland species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Ohio; MLRA 111A. The series is of small extent.
