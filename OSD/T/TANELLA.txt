TANELLA SERIES

The Tanella series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Tanella soils are on flood plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Cumulic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tanella loam, on a linear 2 percent slope in irrigated hay at an elevation of 7,970 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on November 2, 1994 the soil was dry from 0 to 30 inches and moist below.

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium granular structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 3 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    A--4 to 13 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate coarse granular; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel, 8 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 inches thick)

    AC--13 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) very cobbly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak coarse granular; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)

    C1--18 to 27 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) very cobbly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 12 inches thick)

    C2--27 to 80 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) extremely cobbly loamy sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; single grained; loose; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel, 35 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Routt County, Colorado; about 1 mile south of Yampa, Colorado; located about 50 feet east and 1,400 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 14, T. 2 N., R. 85 W.; Yampa USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 8 minutes 22 seconds N. and long. 106 degrees 54 minutes 11 seconds W., NAD 29.

Depth to sandy-skeletal material (C2 horizon): 20 to 40 inches
Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 6 to 14 percent

Texture:  CBV-SL, CBX-SL, CBV-L, CBV-SCL

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the no competing series.  The series in a closely related family are Becks and Wishard.  Becks and Wishard have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium derived from mixed sources.
Landform:  flood plain steps
Slopes:  0 to 3 percent
Elevation: 7,500 to 8,600 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  36 to 40 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  15 to 20 inches. Precipitation is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year.
Frost-free period:  30 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Egeria and Lintim series.
Egeria soils occur on lower flood plains and are poorly drained
Lintim soils occur on structural benches and hills and are well drained

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained, low runoff, moderate over rapid or very rapid permeability.  These soils are rarely flooded for brief periods during the months of April through June.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are irrigated hay and pasture.  There is very little acreage in native vegetation.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Colorado.  LRR E, MLRA 48A.  This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Routt County, Colorado. 1997.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon, Cumulic feature:  From 0 to 18 inches.  (Ap, A, and AC horizons)
Endosaturation: In the Cr horizon, based on observations of saturation. The absence of redoximorphic features is presumed to be due to the sandy-skeletal substratum. Aquic conditions are not recognized in the upper 40 inches.
