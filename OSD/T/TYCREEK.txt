TYCREEK SERIES

The Tycreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Tycreek soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary rock 
Landform: mountain slopes
Slopes:  3 to 50 percent
Elevation:  2,150 to 2,480 meters (7,050 to 9,300 feet)
Mean annual temperature:  4.0 to 6.0 degrees C (39 to 43 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation:  410 to 530 mm (16 to 21 in)
Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months are October to May and driest months are June to September.  
Frost-free period:  70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Beje, Senchert, Toponce, and Zillion series.  The Beje spoils are shallow to bedrock.  The Senchert soils are on similar landforms and are moderately deep to bedrock and pachic.  Toponce soils are on similar landforms and have a cryic temperature regime and vertic properties. Zillion soils are on similar landforms and have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low to medium runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tycreek soils are mainly used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, mountain snowberry, slender wheatgrass, Salina wildrye, and Letterman's needlegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Utah mountains; LRR E, MLRA 48A; The Series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES PROPOSED:  Duchesne County, Utah, 2017.  The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 150 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 27 to 77 cm.  (Bt1, Bt2, and part of the Btk horizon)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 27 cm.  (A1 and A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 27 to 88 cm.  (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizon)
Calcic horizon:  the zone from 60 to 163 cm. (Btk, Bk, and BCk horizons)

Note: The Tycreek series is very similar to the Martinsdale series. Martinsdale occurs primarily in central and northern Montana and extends north to the Canada border. Tycreek was written for Utah because it has significantly higher elevations and very likely a different climatic pattern.  The Martinsdale series previously correlated in Colorado might fit the new Tycreek series concept.
