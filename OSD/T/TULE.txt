TULE SERIES

The Tule series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on bedrock controlled ridges and hillslopes.  They formed in residuum and alluvium derived dominantly from tuffaceous deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, frigid Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tule loam - on a nearly level toeslope facing northeast in native rangeland.  (Colors are for dry unless otherwise stated).

     A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

     C1--3 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 9 inches thick)

     C2--12 to 15 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; 65 percent gravel with carbonate crust on bottoms; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

     R--15 inches; hard white tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Albany County, Wyoming; 1,800 feet east and 1,200 feet north of the SW corner, Section 34, T28N, R77W.  42 degrees 21 minutes 6 seconds north latitude and 106 degrees 3 minutes 25 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  Depth to lithic contact ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  The particle size control section contains 18 to 35 percent clay and has 35 to 45 percent coarse fragments when averaged. The coarse fragments are mainly of gravel size.  This soil is usually dry, but it is moist in April, May, and early June.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine earth is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.

The C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Asholler and Renvers series.  The Asholler series contains 35 to 75 percent fragments that are mainly channers and angular fragments.  The Renvers soils contain 8 to 18 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tule soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping ridges and hillslopes.  The soil formed in alluvium and residuum from the White River Formation.  Elevation is 6,600 to 7,800 feet.  The slope gradient is 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The frost-free season is about 85 to 110 days depending upon aspect and air drainage.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is slow to rapid.  Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat are the primary uses on these soils.  Black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, and forbs are the dominant species in the potential plant community.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Tule soils are of limited extent in south-central Wyoming.
