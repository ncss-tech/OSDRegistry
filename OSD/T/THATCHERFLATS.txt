THATCHERFLATS SERIES

The Thatcherflats series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty alluvium on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is slow. Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Natrixeralfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Thatcherflats silt loam, nonirrigated pasture; on a 0.5 percent slope at 4,930 feet elevation. When described on August 11, 1988, the soil was moist below 56 inches. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong very fine platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 5 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse platy structure parting to moderate medium platy; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Btn--5 to 9 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; strong medium columnar structure parting to strong fine and medium angular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 14 inches thick)

    Btkn1--9 to 11 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Whitearth series. Whitearth soils are well drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thatcherflats soils are on slightly elevated stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 4,900 to 6,200 feet. The soil formed in reworked silty alluvium from loessal deposits. The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches, the average annual air temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F and the frost free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the  Bear Lake,  Chesbrook (T),  Lago (T) and  Wursten series. Bear Lake, Lago and Wursten soils have mollic epipedons. Chesbrook soils lack an argillic horizon. Wursten soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Bear Lake and Chesbrook soils are commonly found in poorly drained depressional to flat positions. Lago soils are on slightly convex to smooth areas and are in complex with Bear Lake soils. Wursten soils occur on low to high terraces on well drained positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability; rare flooding for brief periods March through July.

USE AND VEGETATION: Thatcherflats soils are used for nonirrigated and irrigated pasture. The potential natural vegetation is greasewood and other vegetation adapted to saline soils.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. The soils of this series are not extensive.  MLRA 13.
