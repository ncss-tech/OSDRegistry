TONKAWA SERIES

The Tonkawa series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils.  These nearly level to steep soils formed in sandy beds derived from marine deposits on the Carrizo, Queen City, and Sparta Formations.  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 18 degrees C (65 degrees F); mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tonkawa fine sand, elevation is 155 m (508 ft) (Elevation estimated from topographic software, following location directions below) (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

  A--0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 in); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sand; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness is 8 to 41 cm [3 to 16 in].)

  Bw1--30 to 81 cm (12 to 32 in); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sand; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure parting to single grained; loose; common fine and few medium and coarse roots; common krotovinas; strongly acid; diffuse smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 20 to 140 cm [8 to 55 in].)

  Bw2--81 to 173 cm (32 to 68 in); ; reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) fine sand; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure parting to single grained; loose; common fine and medium roots; few very pale brown spots of uncoated sand; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 20 to 100 cm [8 to 40 in].)

  Bw3--173 to 203 cm (68 to 80 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) and yellow (10YR 7/6) fine sand; weak coarse and very coarse prismatic structure parting to single grained; loose; few fine and medium roots; few yellowish red (5YR 5/8) iron-enriched lamellae less than 0.5 cm thick; few fine nodules of ironstone; very strongly acid.
