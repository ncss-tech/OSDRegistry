TEVIS SERIES 

The Tevis series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in outwash or colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite. These soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Dystric Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tevis gravelly loam, forested.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 2 inches thick)

    A--2 to 5 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 30 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick) 

    E1--5 to 16 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 60 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 15 inches thick) 

    E2--16 to 24 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 15 inches thick) 

    E/Bw--24 to 60 inches; E part (80 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist which surrounds the B part; B part (20 percent) is pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; texture mixed is extremely gravelly sandy loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, medium, and coarse roots; many very fine and fine pores; 60 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2).
