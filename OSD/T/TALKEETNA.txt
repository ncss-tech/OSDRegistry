TYPE LOCATION: Matanuska-Susitna Valley Area, Alaska; about 12 miles north of Palmer; in the NW 1/4 of the SW 1/4 of section 36, T. 20 N., R. 1 E., Seward Meridian.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to the glacial till: is 15 to 24 inches
Silty solum thickness:  15 to 25 inches and may be bisequal
Spodic horizons: 6 to 10 percent total organic carbon 4 to 6 inches thick
Upper part of the control section: formed in loess dominated by amorphous material
Depth to bedrock: 40  to greater than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.

O horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 2 or 3
Reaction class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

A horizon: (where present)
Matrix color: hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 1 or 2
Texture: silt, silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

Bhs horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2
Texture: mucky silt, mucky silt loam, mucky very fine sandy loam
Total organic carbon: 6 to 12 percent
Reaction class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

Bs horizons
Matrix color: hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4; chroma of 3 or 4
Texture: silt, silt loam, very fine sandy loam
Reaction class: extremely acid or very strongly acid

2C horizon:
Matrix color: hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 4 or 5; chroma of 2 or 3
Texture: sandy loam, loam modified by 40 to 60 percent coarse fragments; 30 to 55 percent gravel and 10 to 45 percent cobbles
Consistence: friable to firm
Reaction class: very strongly acid to moderately acid

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hurdygurdy soil. Hurdygurdy soils are presumed to have a colder soil temperature.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Drainage class: well drained
Parent material: ash-influenced loess overlying friable to firm glacial till
Landform: mountain slopes, hills, ridges, and structural benches
Slopes: 0 to 85 percent
Mean annual temperature: 33 to 36 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 35 to 50 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Chunilna, Deneka, and Tsadaka soils. Chunilna soils are very poorly drained and occur on depressions. Deneka soils are well drained and are less than 20 inches to hard bedrock. Are well drained soils and have ortstein.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, very low to high runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the solum and moderately high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is alder, willow, tall grass, and other shrubs and forbs. A few areas are use for summer grazing.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowland, South-central, Alaska  The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Soil Reconnaissance in Alaska, 1914.

REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this profile include:
Albic horizon: from 3 to 4 inches
Spodic horizons: from 7 to 15 inches; 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic
Amorphous material dominant: 3 to 18 inches
Loamy-skeletal material: from 18 to 60 inches
