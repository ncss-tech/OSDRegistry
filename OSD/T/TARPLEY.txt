TARPLEY SERIES

The Tarpley series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey residuum over limestone bedrock of the Cretaceous period.  These soils occur on nearly level to strongly sloping upland plateaus and ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, thermic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tarpley clay loam, stony--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; vertical cracks 1.5 to 3 cm (1/2 to 1 in) wide extend through the horizon; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (Thickness is 8 to 20 cm [3 to 8 in])

    Bt--18 to 46 cm (7 to 18 in); reddish brown (5YR 4/4) clay, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; strong, medium subangular blocky and angular blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine pores; thin continuous clay films on surfaces of peds; few fragments of chert mostly less than 0.75 cm (1/4 in); vertical cracks 1.5 to 3 cm (1/2 to 1 in) wide extend to the bedrock; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Thickness is 15 to 42 cm [6 to 16 in])

    R--46 to 56 cm (18 to 22 in); pale yellow, coarsely fractured, indurated limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Mills County, Texas; from the Mills County Courthouse in Goldthwaite, Texas, 14.5 miles southeast on Farm Road 572; north 1.4 miles on an unpaved road to a private pasture road; east on pasture road 200 yards to the top of a flat mountain and 400 yards southeast on the plateau in rangeland.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class; Well.  
Permeability class: slow.
Runoff: medium on slopes less than 1 percent, high on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and very high on 5 to 10 percent slopes.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  A few small areas are cultivated for crop production of small grains.  Mostly used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists mostly of Texas wintergrass, sideoats grama, little bluestem, and Indiangrass.  Woody vegetation is white shin oak, live oak, post oak, mesquite, catclaw, and pricklypear.
