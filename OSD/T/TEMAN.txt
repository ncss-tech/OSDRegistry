TEMAN SERIES

The Teman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks mostly of volcanic origin that are high in pyroclastic materials.  The Teman soils are on inset fans and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPE LOCATION:  Lander County, Nevada; approximately 8 miles south of Battle Mountain; about 2,250 feet south and 1,000 feet east of the approximate northwest corner of section 27, T. 31 N., R. 45 E.; USGS Blossom Spring 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 31 minutes 51 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 53 minutes 49 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees  latitude,  longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part from October through early June, dry late June through October l; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.
Depth to calcic horizon: 50 to 94 cm.
Depth to Bq horizon: 20 to 36 cm.
Calcic horizon: 30 or more cm thick.  It has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and 5 to 30 percent 3 to 5 mm carbonate concretions.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, usually more alkaline with increasing depth.
Salts and sodium: Normally strongly salt and slightly sodium affected at depths below 20 cm, and free or slightly affected above.  Some pedons are strongly salt and moderately sodium affected throughout the profile.
Gypsum: Segregated gypsum crystals are common at any depth below 18 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 20 to 30 percent. 
Sand fraction:  Less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  
Rock fragments: Some pedons have up to 10 percent gravel below a depth of 100 cm.

A horizon
Hue:  2.5Y or 10YR
Value:  3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Structure:  Very thin to thick platy or prismatic or it is massive.

Bq and Bk horizons
Value:  6 through 8 dry, 4 through 8 moist, light values are in the lower subhorizons.
Chroma:  1 through 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.
Texture:  Silt loam or silty clay loam.
Cementation:  20 to 50 percent weak and moderately strong durinodes.  Some pedons have strata of up to 50 percent discontinuous weak silica cementation.
Other features:  Strata of volcanic ash commonly occur between depths of 40 to 76 cm and are 10 to 20 cm thick in some pedons.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teman soils are on smooth inset fans and some fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks mostly of volcanic origin that are high in pyroclastics.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,375 to 1,475 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Broyles, Creemon, Duffer, Landco, and Whirlo soils.  Broyles, Creemon, and Whirlo soils have cambic horizons and do not have calcic horizons.  Duffer soils have carbonatic mineralogy and are saturated within a depth of 100 cm.  Landco soils have coarse-silty over clayey particle-size control sections and do not have durinodes and calcic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; very slow runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Seasonal water table is 183 to 300 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland, wildlife habitat and irrigated hayland.  The present vegetation is mainly Basin big sagebrush, black greasewood, rubber rabbitbrush, basin wildrye and mustards.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Nevada. MLRA 24. These soils are not extensive.
