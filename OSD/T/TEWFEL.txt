TEWFEL SERIES

The Tewfel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tewfel clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic, many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 8 inches thick)

    A--7 to 12 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw1--12 to 21 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick.)

    2Bw2--21 to 30 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 10 percent channers; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick).

    Cr--30 to 60 inches; semiconsolidated shale.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1408.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 12 inches (Ap, A horizons); a cambic horizon from 12 to 21 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons); a paralithic contact at a depth of 30 inches; a particle-size control section from 10 to 30 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2 horizons).  Tewfel soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
