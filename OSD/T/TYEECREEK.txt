TYEECREEK SERIES

The Tyeecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on midslopes of lateral moraines on glaciated mountains.  Tyeecreek soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial till derived primarily from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Alfic Vitricryands 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tyeecreek ashy silt loam, woodland, on an 18 percent north-facing slope at an elevation of 5,470 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)
