MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES PROPOSED: Montgomery County, North Carolina; 2007.

REMARKS: Tillery soils were formerly included with Tetotum soils. Tetotum soils were mapped as upland soils in the coastal plains and on stream terraces in the Piedmont, but now is restricted to the coastal plains.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 25 centimeters, about 10 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 147 centimeters, about 10 to 58 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and BCtg horizons)
Redox concentrations--the zone from 109 to 203 centimeters, about 43 to 80 inches (BCtg, Cg1, and Cg2 horizons)
Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less--the zone from 51 to 203 centimeters, about 20 to 80 inches (Bt2 through the C horizons)
