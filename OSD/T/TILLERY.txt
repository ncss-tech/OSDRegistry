SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: North Carolina and possibly South Carolina
Extent: Small

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Montgomery County, North Carolina; 2007.

REMARKS: 
Tillery soils were formerly included with Tetotum soils. Tetotum soils were mapped as upland soils in the coastal plains and on stream terraces in the Piedmont, but now is restricted to the coastal plain.  The 02/2026 revision changed formatting. No data was changed.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (10 inches) (A horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 147 centimeters (10 to 58 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and BCtg horizons)
Redox concentrations--the zone from 109 to 203 centimeters (43 to 80 inches) (BCtg, Cg1, and Cg2 horizons)
Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less--the zone from 51 to 203 centimeters (20 to 80 inches) (Bt2 through the C horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln Nebraska; pedon numbers S04NC-123-001, S04NC105-001, S04NC-125-001, and S04NC-007-001.
