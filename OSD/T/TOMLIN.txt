MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES PROPOSED: Yadkin County, North Carolina, 2006

REMARKS: Tomlin soils were previously mapped as Lloyd soils. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Tomlin series as a mesic counterpart. Tomlin soils are commonly associated with Clifford soils (fine, kaolinitic, mesic Typic Kanhapludults). Clifford soils formed in residuum weathered from felsic crystalline rock and have B horizons with hue of 5YR or redder with moist value of 4 or more.  Tomlin soils formed in mixed felsic to mafic crystalline rock (primarily amphibolite) and have B horizons with hue of 2.5YR or redder with moist value of less than 4.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 21 centimeters (Ap horizons)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 21 to 145 centimeters (Bt and BCt horizons)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 21 to 145 centimeters (Bt and BCt horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.: Pedon (S06NC197001) and (S04NC097020C). Note: Pedon S04NC097020C has a fine-loamy particle-size class and is an inclusion with the Tomlin series.  All other soil qualities and properties are within the Tomlin series concept.
