THESSVO SERIES

The Thessvo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Thessvo loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and common fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 6 inches thick) 

    Bk1--4 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine tubular and interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and many fine masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 14 inches thick) 

    Bk2--11 to 15 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; many very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; finely disseminated calcium carbonate, many fine masses of calcium carbonate, and common prominent calcium carbonate casts on undersides of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear abrupt boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    2C--15 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; 50 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
