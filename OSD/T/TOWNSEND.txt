TOWNSEND SERIES

The Townsend series is a moderately deep, moderately well drained soil formed in eolian sands and glacial drift overlying dense glaciomarine sediments.  Townsend soils formed under prairie vegetation and are found on hillslopes of glacial drift plains with slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 500 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Townsend soils are on hillslopes of glacial drift plains at elevations of 0 to 90 meters. They formed in eolian sands and glacial drift overlying dense glaciomarine sediments.  These soils are in a mild marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 460 to 635 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free season is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the San Juan and Zylstra soils.  San Juan soils are somewhat excessively drained and do not have any restrictive features within the soil profile.  Zylstra soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a coarse-loamy particle size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the A1, A2, AB, and 2Bg horizons, and very low in the 2Cd horizon.  Townsend soils have a perched water table as high as 45 centimeters from the soil surface from November to March.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Townsend soils are used for livestock grazing, forage crop production, wildlife habitat, and homesites.  Potential natural vegetation consists of grasses and widely spaced Douglas-fir, Oregon white oak, pacific madrone, Roemers fescue, snowberry, bracken fern, trailing blackberry, bald hip rose, and oceanspray.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Washington; MLRA 2, North.  Series is of small extent.
