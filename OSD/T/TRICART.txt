TRICART SERIES

The Tricart series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tricart clay loam, rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 1 inch; dark grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots; common very fine pores; neutral; (pH 7.3) clear smooth boundary. (1 to 7 inches thick)

    A2--1 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine pores; 5 percent pebbles; neutral; (pH 7.2) clear wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 13 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine pores; 10 percent pebbles; common fine and medium masses of lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; (pH 7.8) gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    2Bk2--13 to 25 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; few very fine pores; 40 percent pebbles; common distinct lime coatings on surface of pebbles; many fine and medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline, (pH 8.4) gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

     2Bk3--25 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak, medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; 55 percent pebbles; common distinct lime coatings on surface of pebbles; many fine and medium masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline. (pH 8.4)

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carter County, Montana, 1992.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1311.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon (mixed to 7 inches)(A1, A2, and part of Bk1 horizons); a calcic horizon from 13 to 60 inches (2Bk2 and 2Bk3 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bk1, 2Bk2, and 2Bk3 horizons).  Tricart soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
