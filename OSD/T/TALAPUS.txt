REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Umbric epipedon--zone from 8 to 66 cm
*Cambic horizon--zone from 66 to 89 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 8 to 108 cm
*Andic soil properties--zone from 8 to 160 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from 8 to 160 cm

08/2016--Assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence.

11/2001--More investigation is needed to determine whether the zone from 25 to 50 cm has less than 2.0 cmol Al (1N KCL).
