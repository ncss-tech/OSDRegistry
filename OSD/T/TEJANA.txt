TEJANA SERIES

The Tejana series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in local alluvium derived from volcanic ash and cinders over sandstone on plains and mesas.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tejana very gravelly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak thin platy and weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and common very fine roots; common fine vesicular pores; 40 percent pebble-sized cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 25 percent cinders; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 14 inches thick)

    C--12 to 24 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 30 percent cinders; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

    2Bwb--24 to 36 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 14 inches thick)

    2C1--36 to 48 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

    2C2--48 to 60 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Catron County, New Mexico; northeast 1/4, sec. 17, T. 3 N., R. 17 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section July through September and December through April.  The soil is driest during May and June. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature:  49 to 56 degrees F.

Depth to discontinuity:  20 to 40 inches
Particle-size control section:  20 to 30 percent clay on a weighted average

Rock fragments:  less than 35 percent cinders on a weighted average above the discontinuity.

A horizon
Value - 3 to 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist

Bw or C horizons
Value - 3 to 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4
Fine earth fraction:  loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam

2B or 2C horizons
Hue - 10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  3 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma:  3 to 7

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Capps (TX), Chugter (MT), Deacon (NM), Shirk (WY), Shore (KS) and Valle (AZ) series.  Capps soils have calcic horizons.  Chugter soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon.  Deacon soils lack a discontinuity within 40 inches and lack cinders.  Shirk soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Shore soils are moist in May and June. Valle soils are noncalcareous to 40 inches or more and lack cinders.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Tejana soils are on plains and mesas.  They formed in local alluvium derived from ash and cinders and sandstone.  The slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 to 15 inches; the average annual temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 115 to 130 days.  Elevation is 6,500 to 7,000 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include Celacy, Flugle, Goesling and Hubbell soils.  Celacy soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Flugle and Goesling soils have argillic horizons.  Hubbell is ashy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately rapid permeability; medium runoff.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The principal use is grazing.  The present vegetation is blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, Russian thistle, rabbitbrush, and juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central New Mexico.  The soil is of moderate extent. MLRA 35.
