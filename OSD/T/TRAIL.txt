TRAIL SERIES

The Trail series consists of very deep, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium. Trail soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Trail loamy sand - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)
 A--0 to 3 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; noneffervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)
 C1--3 to 20 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) stratified loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.
 C2--20 to 26 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) stratified fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; few very thin strata of silt loam, loam, and clay loam; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.
 C3--26 to 43 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) stratified loamy sand, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; common fine irregular pores; few very thin strata of silt loam, loam, and clay loam; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.
 C4--43 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) stratified loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; few very thin strata of very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and silt loam; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4). (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 35 to 58 inches)

TYPE LOCATION: Navajo County, Arizona; on the north side of the Little Colorado River and west of the City of Holbrook; 2,100 feet north and 500 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 1, T. 17 N., R. 20 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February. Driest during May and June. Typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Soil Temperature: 51 to 61 degrees F.
Rock Fragments: less than 15 percent gravel
Reaction: slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline
Calcium carbonate: effervescent from at depth of less than 10 inches to more than 40 inches
Salinity: none to slightly saline
Sodicity: none to slightly sodic

A and C horizons
Hue: 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Texture: coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, sand
Stratification: thin strata of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baroid (WY,) Beebe (UT), and Loveboldt (T)(NV) series. Beebe soils have an exchangeable sodium percentage that exceeds 20 percent. Baroid soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 50 degrees F., and are moist in the moisture control section during May and June. Loveboldt soils are dry in the summer.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Trail soils are on floodplains, channels, valley bottoms, low terraces, alluvial flats, and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in stratified alluvium weathered dominantly from sandstone, siltstone, limestone and mudstone. Elevations range from 3,800 to 6,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 59 degrees F. The frost-free period is 115 to 195 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Epikom, Ives, Jocity, and Tours soils. Epikom soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches. Ives soils are coarse-loamy. Jocity soils are fine-loamy. Tours soils are fine-silty.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained or somewhat excessively drained; low runoff; moderately rapid to rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Trail soils are used for livestock grazing and irrigated cropland. The present vegetation is cottonwood, salt cedar, willow, Russian thistle, camelthorn, fourwing saltbush, and sand dropseed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona, southern Colorado, northern New Mexico and southern Utah. This series is not extensive. MLRA 35 and 36. Use in MLRA 70C is not allowed.
