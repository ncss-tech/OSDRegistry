TRIOMAS SERIES

The Triomas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F). Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.

Ima soils: are on similar landscape positions, do not have an argillic horizon and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control-section.
Penwell soils: are on higher landscape positions.
Ratliff soils: are on similar and slightly lower landscape positions, do not have an argillic horizon and are calcareous throughout.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained and moderately permeable. Runoff is negligible on less than 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mostly for rangeland. A few areas are in cropland with the major crops being cotton and grain sorghum. The native vegetation is little bluestem, sand bluestem, mesa dropseed, hooded sand lovegrass, perennial threeawn, windmillgrass, yucca, sand sage, and a few mesquite trees. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077DY046TX) range site in MLRA-77D.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern High Plains, Southern Part (MLRA 77D in LRR H); of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The series is extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Andrews County, Texas; 1970.

REMARKS: Classification change from Ustalfic Haplargids to Ustollic Haplargids based on Lincoln Laboratory data from the Wickett series and other closely associated series in the same geographic area and position. These soils formerly were formerly included in the Patricia series, but occur in a drier environment.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon:  0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in) (A horizons).
Argillic horizon:  41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) Bt horizons.
Calcic horizon:  172 to 203 cm (68 to 80 in) Btk horizon.
Ustollic feature: Aridic moisture regime that borders on an ustic regime and a 
weighted average sand/clay ratio of approximately 25 with a weighted average 
organic carbon of greater than one-seventh percent in the upper 41 cm (16 in).
