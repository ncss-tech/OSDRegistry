TIVIN SERIES

The Tivin series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian deposits. These soils are on dunes on paleoterrace in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 680 millimeters (27 inches) and mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, mesic Typic Ustipsamments 

TYPICAL PEDON: Tivin fine sand in rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

  A--0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), interior, fine sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), interior, moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; 1 percent clay; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 41 centimeters thick; 3 to 16 inches thick) 

  AC--20 to 46 centimeters (8 to 18 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), interior, fine sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), interior, moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; 1 percent clay; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 41 centimeters; 0 to 16 inches thick) 

  C--46 to 200 centimeters (18 to 79 inches); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6),interior, sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), interior, moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots throughout; 1 percent clay; neutral 

TYPE LOCATION: Reno county, Kansas; 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) north of Hutchinson; 731 meters (2399 feet) west and 247 meters (812 feet) north of southeast corner of sec. 16, T. 22 S. R. 5 W.

Some pedons have a 2C or 2Ab horizon within 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) with textures of very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam. Clay ranges from 10 to 20 percent. Some pedons also have a 3C horizon with sand, fine sand, or coarse sand textures. Clay ranges from 0 to 3 percent. 
Some pedons contain carbonates and gravels.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Duda (SD), McKelvie (NE), Peji (SD), Simeon (NE), and Valentine (NE) soils in the same family. 
Duda and Peji soils are moderately deep and have sandstone at 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  
McKelvie soils have sandstone fragments in the control section.
Simeon soils have up to 15 percent by volume gravel. 
Valentine soils have a mean annual soil temperature lower than 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: eolian deposits
Landform: dunes on paleoterraces in river valleys 
Slopes: 1 to 35 percent
Elevation: 350 to 550 meters (1150 to 1800 feet)
Mean annual air temperature: 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 610 to 890 millimeters (24 to 35 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dillhut, Langdon, Plev, Pratt, Solvay, Spelvin, and Turon series. 
Dillhut soils are moderately well drained, have a buried soil between 50 to 100 centimeters (20 and 40 inches), and occur on lower landform positions. 
Langdon soils contain lamellae, and are on similar landform positions. 
Plev soils are poorly drained, have a buried soil between 100 to 178 centimeters (40 and 70 inches), and are in interdunal depressions. 
Pratt and Turon soils have an argillic horizon and contain lamellae, and occur on lower relief dunes. 
Solvay soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur in interdunes. 
Spelvin soils are well-drained, have a fine-loamy particle size control section and occur on interdunes. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:

DATE: 05/15/95: Series Proposed: Tivin is our mesic soil for Tivoli. We feel that Valentine is a little too far north to be used in south central Kansas. JCW
12/23/99: series established per Reno County final correlation.

08/2011: GLP
