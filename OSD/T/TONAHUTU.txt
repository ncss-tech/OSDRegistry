TONAHUTU SERIES

The Tonahutu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Tonahutu soils are on moraines.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Troutville (CO) series.  In addition, the following soils may be competitors when their classification is updated: the Hyannis(CO), Origo(NM),  and the Yochum(CO) series.
Hyannis and Yochum soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  
Origo soils have a base saturation of 40 to 60 percent, have less than 10 percent mica.  
Troutville soils are bordering an ustic moisture regime, have less than 10 percent mica content, and have rock fragments dominantly 10 to 24 inches in diameter.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist

Elevation:  8,700 to 11,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  38 to 42 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  24 to 34 inches
Precipitation pattern:  uniform throughout the year

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Enentah and Fallriver series.  The Enentah and Fallriver soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on the upper one third of backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, rapid to very rapid runoff,  moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid in the lower part..

USE AND VEGETATION:  Recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is subalpine fir, Engelmann's spruce, and lodgepole pine with an understory of grouse whortleberry and russet buffaloberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48A. This series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Grand County, Colorado, Rocky Mountain National Park soil survey area, 1999.  The name is from a prominent drainage in the area, and is also the Arapaho word for meadow. Pronounced ton-uh-HOO-too.

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 1 to 6 inches.  (E horizon)
Argillic horizon composed of lamellae:  The zone from 6 to 45 inches.  (E and Bt1, E and Bt2, and Bt and E horizons)
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 11 to 41 inches.  (part of the E and Bt1, the E and Bt2, and part of the Bt and E horizon)

Originally recognized as Troutville but was separated after laboratory data established high mica content.

Keys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998.
