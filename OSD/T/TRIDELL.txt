TRIDELL SERIES

The Tridell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, shale and quartzite.  Tridell soils are on fan remnants and hills.  Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arle, Bigsheep, Guben, Tricart and Whetrock Series.  Not yet updated to the Eight Edition of SOIL TAXONOMY is the Trimad series.  
Arle and Whetrock soils are moderately deep.
Bigsheep, Tricart and Trimad soils have moisture control sections affected by peak periods of moisture in the spring and early summer.
Guben soils formed in a thick mantle of mixed volcanic alluvium on pediment surfaces.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, shale and quartzite
Landform:  fan remnants and hills
Slopes:  4 to 50 percent
Elevation:  6,000 to 8,000 feet
Mean annual temperature:  42 to 45 degrees
Mean annual precipitation:  12 to 16 inches
Frost-free period:  90 to 110 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boxring, Ironco, and Waterhill series.  The Boxring soils are shallow with argillic horizons and are on mountain slopes.  The Ironco soils have argillic horizons and are on hills and outwash plains.  The Waterhill soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and are on fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate or high runoff, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland.  The potential vegetation is twoneedle pinyon, Utah juniper, black sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, and birchleaf mountain mahogany.  This soil has been correlated to Upland Stony Loam (Pinyon-Utah Juniper) 047CY335UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah and in Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 47C; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Uintah County, Utah, Roosevelt-Duchesne Soil Survey Area, Utah, 1947.  The name comes from a geographic feature in the survey area.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons)
Mollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 inches.  (A, and Bw horizons)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 60 inches.  (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3, and Bk4 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.

The surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, "Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979."

Taxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.

The type location was moved to its current location to better reflect the series concept.
