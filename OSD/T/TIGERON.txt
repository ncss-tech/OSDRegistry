TIGERON SERIES

The Tigeron series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium derived from sandstone, argillite, quartzite, and other igneous rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.
