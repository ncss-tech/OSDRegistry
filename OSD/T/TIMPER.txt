TIMPER SERIES

The Timper series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Timper soils are on fan skirts, fan piedmonts and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Cambidic Haplodurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Timper sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm; gray (10YR 6/1) sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine and medium vesicular pores; 10 percent fine gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 cm thick)

    A2--8 to 15 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular and many fine vesicular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.7); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 20 cm thick)

    Bw--15 to 25 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 28 cm thick)

    Bqkm--25 to 46 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) strongly silica and carbonate-cemented gravelly duripan, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate thick platy structure; extremely hard, very firm; many fine roots in cracks and between plates; many cracks that occur between plates and where the pan is fractured; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); clear wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 cm thick)

    2Bqk--46 to 69 cm; light gray (10YR 7/1) stratified gravelly loamy sand and sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; moderate thick platy structure due to stratification and weak cementation, single grained in other strata; hard in some strata, loose in others, firm and loose when moist, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots that run horizontally between plates; common very fine interstitial pores in cemented strata and many very fine and fine interstitial pores in other strata; 20 percent gravel, violently effervescent on the outer faces of plates and slightly effervescent within plates and noncemented strata; strongly alkaline (pH 8.9); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    3Bqkm--69 to 91 cm; light gray (10YR 7/1) strongly silica-carbonate cemented duripan, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; extremely hard, very firm, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine roots; few fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent in fractures and noneffervescent elsewhere but has thin very pale brown (10YR 8/2) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist sheets where carbonate and silica have accumulated on plate tops; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

    4C--91 to 152 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grained; loose; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 50 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1).

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; about 1,320 feet south and 100 feet west of the northeast corner of section 33, T. 3 S., R. 55 E.; USGS White Blotch Springs NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 38 minutes 46 seconds N and longitude 115 degrees 47 minutes 19 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.6461111 latitude, -115.7886111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winters and early spring months and for l0 to 20 days cumulative between July through October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to duripan:  25 to 50 cm.
Depth to unconformable material:  75 to 150 cm.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  5 to l8 percent.
Rock fragments:  Up to 50 percent in any horizon but when mixed average less than 35 percent, mostly gravel.

A horizon 
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  l through 3.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline. 
Carbonates:  Slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.

Bw horizon 
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Texture:  Sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline 
Carbonates:  Slightly through violently effervescent.
Structure:  Granular or subangular blocky.

2Bqk horizon (when present) 
Texture:  Stratified loam through very gravelly coarse sand.  
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline through very strongly alkaline 
Carbonates:  Noneffervescent through strongly effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adelaide, Belcher Blackhawk and Truhoy series.

Adelaide soils have a buried Bt horizon and the particle-size control section average texture is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam and it is noncalcareous above the duripan.  Belcher soils have semiconsolidated lake laid tuff below a depth of 50 cm.  Blackhawk soils have a dominantly silt loam noncalcareous particle-size control section. Truhoy soils have a Bqk horizon with silica cementation above the duripan.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Timper soils are on alluvial flats, fan piedmonts and fan skirts. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,225 to 1,936 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is l30 to l50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aysees, Fang, Jarboe, Kawich, and Penoyer soils.  All of these soils are very deep and lack a duripan.  Also, Aysees soils are sandy-skeletal and have a calcic horizon; Fang soils are coarse-loamy and have high chroma iron mottles within a depth of 100 cm; Kawich soils are sandy; and Penoyer soils are coarse-silty.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, medium or slow runoff, high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is mainly graymolly, shadscale, and annuals.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada.  These soil are not extensive. MLRA 29.
