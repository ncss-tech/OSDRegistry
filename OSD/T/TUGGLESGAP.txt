MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Patrick County, Virginia, 2008.

REMARKS: Tugglesgap soils were previously mapped as Dillard and soils. Dillard soils have fewer rock fragments and a seasonal high water table at a depth of 2 to 3 feet. Tugglesgap soils are seasonally wet from November to April. The average depth to the top of the wet zone is thought to be less than 50 centimeters (20 inches); however, soil morphology does not meet the criteria for an aquic great group (Endoaquults). At present, reaction to alpha,alpha-dipyridyl reaction has not been tested. It is anticipated Tugglesgap soils may be reclassified to Aeric Endoaquults once additional data has been collected.

Diagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 7 to 35 inches (Bt and Btg horizons)
Aquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the Argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year.
Lithologic discontinuity--Contrasting fragment content and hardness starting at a depth of 50 inches (2C horizon)
Series control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches.

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S99VA141013. Additional reference sample is S99VA141014.
