TOPHAT SERIES

The Tophat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from mixed sources. These soils are on hills, mountains, ridges and landslides. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Etnass, Jumpstart, Nearl, Quirt and Sedgway series. Etnass soils are on nearby ridges, summits and sideslopes. They formed in residuum from shale, have intersecting slickensides and cracks, and are 10 to 40 inches deep to carbonates. Jumpstart soils are on nearby sideslopes. They have a forest litter horizon and lack a mollic epipedon. Nearl soils are on nearby basins. They have a forest litter horizon, lack an argillic horizon, and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick. Quirt soils are on nearby sideslopes. They formed in residuum from shale, have a mollic epipedon less that 16 inches thick, and are 15 to 30 inches deep to carbonates. Sedgway soils are on nearby ridges, summits and sideslopes. They average less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tophat soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat. These soils commonly support communities that have a shrub layer of mountain big sagebrush, spike big sagebrush or subalpine big sagebrush, with an herbaceous layer dominated by California brome, slender wheatgrass or bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: They are of moderate extent in southeastern Idaho and southwestern Montana.  MLRAs - 43B, 46.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.
