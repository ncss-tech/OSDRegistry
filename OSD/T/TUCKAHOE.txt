TUCKAHOE SERIES

Soils of the Tuckahoe series are deep and well drained.  They
formed in recent alluvium sediment on nearly level flood plains in the Piedmont and upper Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Dystric Fluventic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tuckahoe loam - in a cultivated area.
(Colors are for moist soil.)

     Ap--0 to 10 inches; dark brown (10YR 4/3) loam; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; few fine flakes of mica; few worm casts; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches
thick)

     BA--10 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; nonsticky, slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine pores; few fine flakes of mica; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 14 inches thick)

     Bwl--17 to 30 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few fine flakes of mica; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)

     Bw2--30 to 43 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; few fine flakes of mica; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

     Bw3--43 to 61 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic few fine roots; few distinct light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand coatings; few fine flakes of mica; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)

     C--61 to 68 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) silt loam; massive; friable, nonsticky, slightly plastic; few fine roots; few dark oxide stains; few fine flakes of mica; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Goochland County, Virginia; 1.7 miles southeast of intersection of Highways 600 and 627 and 50 feet east of the James River.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 40 to 65 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments, where present, are less than 5 percent by volume at depths of less than 40 inches.  Content of flakes of mica ranges from none to many.  A buried horizon is in some pedons in the lower part of the solum.  The soil ranges from strongly acid through neutral throughout the solum.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.

The B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Mottles are in some pedons, but mottles with chroma of 2 or less are below 24 inches.  The B horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Sand content is less than 45 percent.

The C horizon is stratified, and is variable in color and texture.

COMPETING SERIES:  The Hannahatchee and Ocana soils are the only series in the same family.  The Hannahatchee soils have greater than 45 percent sand in the B horizon.  The Ocana soils are formed in alluvium weathered from limestone and have 15 to 35 percent chert in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tuckahoe soils formed in recent alluvium on nearly level flood plains in the Piedmont and upper Coastal Plain.  Slopes are commonly less than 2 percent.  The loamy sediments are largely derived from soils formed in material weathered from
schist, gneiss, granite, phyllite, and other metamorphic and
igneous rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches and mean annual
temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Monacan, Toccoa,
Bolling, Buncombe, Fork, Pamunkey, and Wehadkee soils.  Bolling, Fork, and Pamunkey soils are Alfisols.  Buncombe soils are in a sandy family.  Wehadkee soils are Fluvaquents.  Monacan soils are aquentic and Toccoa soils are coarse loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are cleared and used for crops or pasture.  Corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay are the principal crops.  A few small areas are in woodland consisting of yellow-poplar, loblolly pine and white oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Virginia, North Carolina, and possibly Georgia.  This series is of small extent.
