TROUP SERIES

The Troup series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in unconsolidated sandy and loamy marine sediments. Troup soils are on ridges and hillslopes.  Slopes predominantly range from 0 to 15 percent but range to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (64 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1320 millimeters (52 inches). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Grossarenic Kandiudults

Blanton soils are somewhat excessively drained to moderately well drained on lower positions and are in a Grossarenic subgroup. 
Bonneau soils are well drained on lower, stream terrace positions, are in an Arenic subgroup and have an argillic horizon at depths of 56 to 188 centimeters (22 to 74 inches). 
Bonifay soils are well drained soils and are on slightly lower positions, have more than 5 percent plinthite in the argillic horizons and are in the Grossarenic Plinthic subgroup. 
Fuquay soils are well drained on lower positions and are in an Arenic subgroup. 
Lakeland soils are excessively drained on similar to higher positions and are Quartzipsamments. 
Lucy soils are well drained on similar positions and are in an Arenic subgroup. 
Orangeburg soils are well drained on similar to lower positions, have a control section of fine-loamy, and are in the Typic subgroup. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Somewhat excessively drained 
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity (Ksat): moderately high in the Bt horizon and high in the A and E horizons 
Permeability: moderate in the Bt horizon and rapid in the A and E horizons 
Flooding frequency and Duration: None 
Ponding frequency and Duration: None 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas of Troup soils are in forests of pine and mixed hardwoods. Cleared areas are used for pastureland and for growing peanuts, watermelons, and vegetables. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Major Land Resource Area (MLRA's): The series occurs primarily in the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A).  It also occurs to a lesser extent in the Carolina and Georgia Sand Hills (MLRA 137), North Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 138), Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152A), and the Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 153A).
Extent: large extent

SERIES ESTABLISHED: 
Houston County, Alabama in 1965. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 

Particle-size control section: 112 to 162 centimeters (44 to 64 inches) 

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 112 centimeters (0 to 44 inches) (A, E1, and E2 horizons) 

Grossarenic feature - the zone from 0 to 112 centimeters, from the mineral soil surface (0 to 44 inches) (A, E1, and E2 horizons) 

Argillic horizon - the zone from 112 to 203 centimeters (44 to 80 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons) 

Kandic horizon - the zone from 112 to 203 centimeters (44 to 80 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt2 horizons) 

The classification changed from Paleudult to Kandiudult in recognition of the low activity clay amendment to the Keys of Soil Taxonomy 3rd Edition (1/89). This soil is currently classified according to the 12th Edition of the Keys of Soil Taxonomy.
