TASCOSA SERIES

The Tascosa series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and gravelly alluvial sediments of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on convex, gently sloping to steep knobs and erosional hillslopes in the Canadian Breaks and margins of the Southern High Plains.  Slope ranges from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tascosa gravelly loam, north-facing, convex, 4 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of about 3,200 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 9 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2); moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to granular; slightly hard, friable; many roots; about 35 percent of 5 to 20 mm diameter medium quartzite gravel; about 50 percent of soil surface is covered with gravel; few wormcasts; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (7 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk--9 to 13 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) extremely gravelly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; common fine and medium roots; about 10 percent calcium carbonate films, threads, and coatings on the underside of quartzite gravel; about 60 percent of 7 to 20 mm diameter medium quartzite gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

    C--20 to 80 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) very gravelly sandy loam, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) moist; single grain; loose, very friable; about 50 percent of 5 to 20 mm diameter medium quartzite gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

October through March are the driest months.  These soils are intermittently moist in April through September.
Mean annual soil temperature: 59 to 65 degrees F.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 0 to 26 inches.
Depth to quartzite gravel: 0 to 80 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hathaway series.  Similar soils are the Gallegos, Hilgrave, Pena, Polar, Potter, and Veal series.
Hathaway series: formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources of limestone, rhyolite, granite, dacite, andesite, tuff, quartzite, sandstone, and shale. 
Gallegos and Polar series: have an ochric epipedon and in addition, Gallegos series is noncalcareous in the upper 7 inches.
Hilgrave series: has an argillic horizon and is noneffervescent in the A and upper Bt horizons.
Potter series: has carbonatic soil mineralogy.
Veal series: have less than 5 percent siliceous gravel and carbonatic soil mineralogy.
Pena series: have a thicker mollic epipedon and cobbly or stony AC and C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: sandy and gravelly alluvial sediments of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.
Landform: convex, gently sloping to steep knobs and erosional hillslopes in the Canadian Breaks and margins of the Southern High Plains (MLRA 77E).
Slopes: dominantly 3 to 30 percent.
Mean annual air temperature: 57 to 63 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 17 to 23 inches. 
Frost-free period: 175 to 220 days.
Elevation: 2,200 to 4,800 feet.
Thornthwaite annual P-E Index Values: 30 to 34.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ady, Berda, Guadalupe, Mobeetie Likes, Plemons, Potter, Springer, and Veal series.
Ady soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and have an ochric epipedon and an argillic horizon.
Berda and Veal soils are on similar hillslope landscape positions and have an ochric epipedon and a fine loamy particle-size control section.
Guadalupe soils are on lower landscape positions on floodplains and have coarse loamy particle-size class.
Mobeetie and Likes soils are on similar hillslope landscape positions and have an ochric epipedon and a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.
Springer soils are on lower landscape positions and have an ochric epipedon and an argillic horizon.
Potter soils are on higher landscape positions and have carbonatic soil mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Moderate permeability.  Surface runoff is low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, medium on 5 to 20 percent slopes, and high on greater than 20 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is primarily used for rangeland and wildlife and supports stands of little bluestem, black grama, hairy grama, sideoats grama, blue grama, and sand dropseed with some catclaw and yucca.  It produces low amounts of forage.  This soil has been correlated to the Mixedland Slope (077EY061TX) range site in MLRA-77E.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Canadian Breaks and margins of the Southern High Plains of western Texas, possibly extending into Oklahoma and New Mexico (MLRA-77E in LRR H).  The series is of moderate extent.
