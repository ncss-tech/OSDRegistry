TYBO SERIES

The Tybo series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, andesite, basalt, and welded tuff. Tybo soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Haplodurids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Tybo gravelly fine sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is partially covered with approximately 18 percent gravel. 

 A1--0 to 5 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 25 percent gravel; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline pH 9.4); abrupt smooth boundary. 

 A2--5 to 10 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin and medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine through medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films coating sand grains; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 13 cm combined thickness of A horizons) 

 Bw--10 to 18 cm; pale brown (10YR/ 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine through medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films coating sand grains; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear broken boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick) 

 Bk--18 to 28 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and few medium roots; few very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 38 cm thick) 

 Bkqm--28 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) cemented material, very pale brown (10YR 7/4) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm, indurated by secondary silica and secondary calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6). 

TYPE LOCATION: Nye County Nevada; about 10.5 miles north-northwest of Tonopah; in the southwest one quarter of the southwest one quarter of section 9, T. 4 N., R. 42 E.; USGS Crescent Dunes 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 12 minutes 39.1 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 16 minutes 34.9 seconds W; NAD 83; UTM zone 11N 475805E, 4229247N, NAD83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Usually dry, but are moist for short periods during the winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative following convection storms during July through October; typic aridic soil moisture regime. 
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 15 degrees C. 
Depth to duripan: 20 to 50 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: Averages 15 to 35 percent, mainly gravel and gravel-sized duripan fragments. 

A horizons
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4, dry or moist.
Effervescence: Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent. 
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 1 to 6 percent. 
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

Bk horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4, dry or moist.
Texture: Gravelly sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly very fine sandy loam.
Clay content: 8 to 18 percent.
Rock fragments: 15 to 35 percent.
Structure: Subangular blocky or massive.
Consistence: Nonsticky or slightly sticky, nonplastic or slightly plastic.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 3 to 10 percent. 
Reaction: Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.

Bkqm horizon
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y.
Value: 6 through 8 dry, 4 though 7 moist.
Chroma: 1 through 4, dry or moist.
Structure: Thick platy or massive.
Consistence: Indurated or strongly cemented with an indurated subhorizon. 

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Garhill, Sodhouse, and Univega series. 

Garhill soils have lithic contacts below the duripan at depths of 30 to 76 cm. Sodhouse soils have cambic horizons and are noncalcareous. Univega soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tybo soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone, andesite, basalt, and welded tuff. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,990 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluewing, Delamar, Geer, Koyen, Leo, Old Camp, Osobb, and Stumble soils. Bluewing soils are very deep and sandy-skeletal. Delamar soils have argillic horizons and are greater than 50 cm to the duripan. Geer, Koyen, and Leo soils do not have duripans. Old Camp soils have argillic horizons and are shallow to basalt. Osobb soils are loamy-skeletal. Stumble soils are very deep and sandy. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; very low to very high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Tybo soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly spiny hopsage, Nevada ephedra, galleta, snakeweed, Anderson's wolfberry, and littleleaf horsebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South-central Nevada. These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 29.
