TOGNONI SERIES

The Tognoni series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt.  Tognoni soils are on hills and mountain slopes, mesas, plateaus and pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tognoni extremely gravelly fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A1--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) extremely gravelly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 45 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

   A2--5 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong medium platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine vesicular and tubular pores; 25 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

   Bt1--10 to 18 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderately fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; many very fine tubular pores; common distinct films lining pores and few faint clay films on ped faces; 20 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 8 cm thick)

   Bt2--18 to 36 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct films on ped faces and lining pores; 30 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; common moderately thick silica and carbonate pendants on rock fragments in the lower part of the horizon; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (8 to 25 cm thick)

   R--36 cm; fractured basalt, very thin discontinuous silica-carbonate laminar cap and coatings in fractures.

TYPE LOCATION:  Esmeralda County, Nevada approximately 500 feet from the Nye County line, about 400 feet east and 800 feet north of the southwest corner of Section 4, T. 2 S., R. 43 E.; USGS McMahon Ridge 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 47 minutes 22 seconds N and 117 degrees 10 minutes 6 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.7894444 latitude, -117.1683333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods winter and early spring and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 11 to 14 degrees C.
Depth to bedrock: 8 to 36 cm.
Reaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Percent clay:  27 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments:  45 to 70 percent.

A horizon
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Effervescence:  Slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.
Lower boundary:  Abrupt or very abrupt.

Bt horizon
Hue:  10YR or 7.5YR.
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Clay loam or clay.  Subhorizons of clay loam are in some pedons.
Clay content:  Averages 35 to 45 percent clay.
Rock fragments:  45 to 70 percent, dominantly cobbles.
Structure:  Subangular blocky or granular.
Consistence: Soft to hard, very friable to friable, slightly sticky to sticky, slightly plastic to plastic.
Effervescence:  Noneffervescent to slightly effervescent.
Other features:  Silica and carbonate pendants are common in the lower part in most pedons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Downeyville, Etinarg, Hoot, Mirkwood, Theon, Valleycity, Vium and Waucoba series.  

Downeyville, Etinarg, Hoot, Mirkwood, Theon, Valleycity, Vium and Waucoba soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tognoni soils are on hills or mountain slopes, mesas, plateaus and pediments.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,525 to 2,075 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 110 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blacktop and competing Downeyville soils.  Blacktop soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff, moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is shadscale, galleta, Bailey greasewood, Anderson wolfberry, Nevada Ephedra, bud sagebrush, Joshua tree, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  West-central Nevada.  The Tognoni series is of small extent.  MLRA 29.
