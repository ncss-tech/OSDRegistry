TOMBALL SERIES

The Tomball series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Willis Formation. These nearly level soils occur in open ended depressions on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (45 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F).

SERIES PROPOSED: Waller County, Texas, 2018. The name is from a town in Harris County.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Gessner and Waller series. The series was separated based on geology, landform, and MLRA. Gessner and Waller soils are on the Lissie Formation. Gessner soils are in oval depressions and Waller soils are on flats. In addition, Waller soils are in MLRA 152B (Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods)

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 45 to 95 cm (18 to 38 in) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 45 cm (0 to 18 in) (A and E horizons) 
Argillic horizon: 45 to 203 cm (18 to 80 in) (Bt and Btg horizons)
Episaturation: 0 to 77 cm (0 to 30 in) (A, E and Bt1 horizons)
Aquic conditions: 0 to 45 cm (0 to 18 in)

Additional Comments: The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by MLRA soil survey office laboratory data number on pedon S2018TX4734889 from the type location in Waller County, Texas.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Data from type location S2018TX4734889. Particle-size analysis, salinity and sodicity tests were performed at the project office on 6 pedons.
