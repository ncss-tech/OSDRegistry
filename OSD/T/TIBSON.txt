TIBSON SERIES

The Tibson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alpine till, alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived mainly from limestone, dolomite, sandstone and argillite rock.  These soils are on moraines, stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, mountains, hills, ridges and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Calcicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tibson cobbly loam, in native vegetation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) cobbly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots, and common medium roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 8 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk1--8 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coats in pores, and many medium masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 12 inches thick)

    Bk2--14 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; very hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots to 42 inches, and few very fine roots below this depth; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; common medium masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - moraines, stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, mountains, hills, ridges and landslides
Elevation - 4,490 to 9,300 feet
Slope - 0 to 70 percent
Parent material - alpine till, alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived mainly from limestone, dolomite, sandstone and argillite rock

Mean annual precipitation - 14 to 25 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 34 to 43 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tibson soils are used mainly as rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Idaho fescue, Columbia needlegrass, shrubby cinquefoil, creeping juniper, and forbs.  These soils also support low-density stands of limber pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, and Douglas-fir.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: These soils are of moderate extent.  MLRAs - 43B, 44B, 46.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Choteau-Conrad Area Soil Survey, Teton County, Montana, 1991; proposed in Teton County, Montana, 1984.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 8 inches (A, Bw horizons)
Calcic horizons - from 8 to 60 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizon)
