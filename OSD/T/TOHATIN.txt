TOHATIN SERIES

The Tohatin series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone.  Tohatin soils are on treads and risers of dissected fan terraces.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Denazar (NM), Lynndyl (UT), and Sandbench (UT) series.  Denazar soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower and calcic horizon at 10 to 35 inches. Lynndyl soils have hue of 10YR and mean annual soil temperatures of 47 to 52 degrees F.  Sandbench soils are moderately deep to bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tohatin soils are on treads and risers of dissected fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium and eolian material derived from Jurassic and Triassic sandstone.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,900 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aneth, Claysprings, Sheppard, Mota, and Piute soils.  Aneth soils do not have diagnostic calcic horizons and occur on adjacent eolian-mantled surfaces.  Claysprings soils are shallow and occur on backslopes.  Sheppard soils do not have diagnostic horizons and occur on stable dunes.  Mota soils are coarse-silty and have horizons with more than 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and are on adjacent stable fan terraces and alluvial cones.  Piute soils are very shallow to sandstone on structural benches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tohatin soils are used for livestock grazing.  Present vegetation is blackbrush, Indian ricegrass, galleta, sand dropseed, sandhill muhly, and Cutler Mormon tea.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tohatin soils are of small extent on the Blanding Basin and Tyende Saddle portions of the Colorado Plateau province in northeast Arizona.  MLRA is 35.
