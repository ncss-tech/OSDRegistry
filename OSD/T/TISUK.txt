COMPETING SERIES: These are the McKinley and Pinguk soils. McKinley soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Pinguk soils have saturated horizons in the spring.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: hills, mountains, till plains
Parent material: silty eolian deposits over gravelly till
Elevation: 387 to 778 feet
Slope: 0 to 20 percent
Annual precipitation: 21 to 29 inches
Annual temperature: 24.8 degrees F
Frost-free period: 60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Dirrant, Imuruk, and Kuzitrin soils. Dirrant soils are very poorly drained, shallow to permafrost, and occur on till plains. Imuruk soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, and occur on hills, and outwash plains. Kuzitrin soils are somewhat poorly drained, very deep, and occur on swales on mountains and swales on till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military use and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is ericaceous shrub/lichen dwarf scrub.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 240, Nulato Hills-Southern Seward Peninsula Highlands, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
