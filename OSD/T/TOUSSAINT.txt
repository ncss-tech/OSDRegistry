TOUSSAINT SERIES

The Toussaint series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. They formed in till that has been leveled by wave action and are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fonda and Toledo series. Fonda and Toledo soils are deeper than 56 cm (22 inches) to carbonates and do not have a densic contact within the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toussaint soils occur on lake plains of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Toussaint soils formed in till that has been leveled by wave action. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hoytville, Nappanee, and St. Clair soils. The very poorly drained Hoytville soils, the somewhat poorly drained Nappanee soils, and the moderately well drained St. Clair soils are in a catena with the Toussaint soils. The Nappanee and St. Clair soils are on slight rises, and on backslopes and shoulders of nearby dissected areas. The Hoytville soils are on flats, depressions or drainageways. In areas where Hoytville and Toussaint soils are adjacent, the Hoytville soils are on slightly higher positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum, moderately low in the lower part of the solum, and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the solum, slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the substratum. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of the Toussaint soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans and wheat are the principal crops. Some areas are used for specialty crops, such as tomatoes and sugar beets. A relatively small proportion is in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest, primarily swamp white oak, bur oak, pin oak, elm, hickory, ash, cottonwood, basswood, and soft maple with some marsh grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Ohio, and possibly northeastern Indiana and southeastern Michigan; MLRA 99. The series is of small extent, about 800 acres.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wood County, Ohio, 2009.

REMARKS: A mineralogy study of this catena is currently in progress in MLRA 99. This study may result in a change of mineralogy from illitic to mixed.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon (mollic intergrade): from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 86 cm (Bg horizon).
Densic contact: at 132 cm (top of the Cd1 horizon).
Aquic conditions: the zone from 0 to 203 cm.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory (WD-137). Supporting lab data from the same delineation is available (WD-87).
