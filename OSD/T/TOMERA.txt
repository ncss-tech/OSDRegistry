TOMERA SERIES

The Tomera series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed, but dominantly sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic materials.  Tomera soils are on dissected terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chappuis, Kiesel, Longdis, Owinza and Standish series.   

Chappuis soils have carbonates starting at 8 to 38 cm. Kiesel soils are calcareous throughout. Longdis soils lack rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Owinza soils are calcareous in the Btn horizons. Standish soils are somewhat poorly drained.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tomera soils are on dissected terraces and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed but dominantly sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic materials.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,460 to 1,830 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C., and the frost free season is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cherry Spring, Chiara, Cortez, and Orovada soils.  Cherry Spring and Cortez soils have duripans at depths between 50 and 100 cm.  Chiara soils have a duripan at depths of less than 50 cm.  Orovada soils have a cambic horizon and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well-drained; medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, Sandberg bluegrass, cheatgrass and annual forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada.  Tomera soils are of moderately extensive. MLRA 25.
