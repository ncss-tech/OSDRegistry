SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, Oregon; 2018

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Volcanic glass--zone from the surface to a depth of 13 cm
*Depth to lithologic discontinuity--43 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 43 cm

8/2017--The Twinbridge series is limited in extent, but it was proposed because of the unique limestone geology. The pedon was described by Bob Ottersberg in 1993.
