TECOLOTE SERIES

The Tecolote series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed mainly in material weathered from felsite. Tecolote soils are on sideslopes, backslopes, and toeslopes of mountains and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Tecolote very stony loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    0i--0 to 1 inches; slightly decomposed organic material consisting mainly of leaves, twigs, needles, and bark. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    A--1 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) very stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 25 percent gravel and 40 percent rounded cobbles and stones; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. (1 to 7 inches thick)

    E--4 to 13 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) very gravelly loamy sand, brown(7.5YR 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel and 10 percent rounded cobbles and stones; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    BE--13 to 30 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 55 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles and stones; neutral; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt--30 to 46 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; thin discontinuous waxlike coatings on faces of peds and on portions of coarse fragments; 60 percent gravel and 20 percent rounded cobbles and stones; neutral; gradual irregular boundary. (10 to 25 inches thick)

    C--46 to 66 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; silghtly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent rounded cobbles and stones; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION: El Paso County, Colorado; at U.S. Air Force Academy along the pipeline road in the SW 1/4 of sec. 16, T. 12 S., R. 67 W.; Palmer Lake USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 00 minutes 03 seconds N, long. 104 degrees 54 minutes 06 seconds W, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: ustic moisture regime, typic subclass.
Mean annual soil temperature: 42 to 46 degrees F. 
Depth to bedrock: is 60 inches or more. 
Depth to the base of the Bt: more than 40 inches. 
Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent; cobbles and stones range from 15 to 50 percent, and gravel ranges from 20 to 40 percent.

The O horizons are missing in some pedons. 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist

E horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 or 3 moist 
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loam. 
Some pedons have weak thin platy structure. 
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

BE horizon (if present):
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture: clay loam or sandy clay loam
Some pedons are high in very fine sand.
Reaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: 
Colomex (NM): has discontinuity
Laventana (NM): bedrock at 40 to 60 inches
Macmeal (MT): has secondary carbonates
Mocmont (MT): has B/E horizons
Namon (UT): bedrock at 40 to 60 inches
Sheek (CO): has very stony Bt
Skyview (MT): bedrock at 20 to 40 inches
Sonsela (NM): does not have E horizons
Towaoc soils: does not have an E horizon
Trapps (MT): has secondary carbonates
Vision (MT): does not have E horizons
Xankey soils: does not have an E horizon
Wahatoya (CO): bedrock at 20 to 40 inches
Ymark (MT): bedrock at 40 to 60 inches
Yourame (MT): has secondary carbonates
Yreka (MT): has E/Bt horizons 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: sideslopes, backslopes, and toeslopes of mountains. 
Elevation: 7,000 to 8,800 feet 
Slopes: 5 to 70 percent
Parent material: weathered felsite or sediments from felsite; this material in places appears to have been modified by loess deposits. 
Average annual precipitation: 15 to 25 inches.
Average annual temperature: 40 to 45 degrees F
Frost free season: 70 to 110 days.. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Erramouspe, Pinata and Stroupe soils. Erramouspe and Stroupe soils do not have a frigid temperature regime; also, Stroupe soils have a mollic epipedon. Pinata soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is medium on 5 to 20 percent and high on slopes greater than 20 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Forest, grazing, wildlife and recreation. Vegetation is ponderosa pine, some Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, scattered pinyon and juniper and Gambel oak; some Arizona fescue, bullgrass, Parry's oatgrass, deergrass and mountain muhly in the understory.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mountains and foothills in Colorado and northern New Mexico. The series is moderately extensive.  LRR E, MLRA 48A and 49.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: El Paso County, Colorado, 1975.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 1 to 4 inches. (A horizon)
Albic horizon: 4 to 13 inches. (E horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 30 to 46 inches. (Bt horizon)

Type location was moved from Lincoln County, NM to El Paso County, CO on 5/01.  The series range was narrowed to MLRAs 48A and 49. It is unclear whether the historical climax plant community at the type location includes Douglas-fir or whether it is only ponderosa pine. At the El Paso County type location there is no pinyon-juniper vegetation, which was on the original type location in New Mexico; this is now outside the series concept. The moisture regime subclass is left as typic ustic on the 11/2007 revision, but if it can be verified that this series typically has a Douglas-fir climax plant community, the classification will likely be updated to a Udic subgroup, udic ustic moisture subclass.
