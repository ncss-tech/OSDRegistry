TICK SERIES

The Tick series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly slope alluvium and the underlying dense, clayey mudstone. These soils are on gently sloping to very steep upland ridges.  Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, subactive, mesic Typic Hapludults

TYPICAL PEDON: Tick very gravelly silt loam - on a convex ridgetop of 7 percent slope in an oak forest at an elevation of 1,460 feet.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Oi--0 to 1 inches; slightly decomposed oak leaf litter.

   A--1 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly silt loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry; moderate medium granular structure; very friable; common coarse roots; many fine tubular pores; 35 percent chert gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick) 

   E--6 to 11 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few coarse roots; common very fine tubular and many very fine irregular pores; 15 percent chert gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 7 inches thick)

   Bt1--11 to 19 inches; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) silty clay loam; weak medium platy structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; friable; few coarse roots; common very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; common fine black (N 2/0) iron and manganese oxide concretions; 5 percent soft mudstone paragravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary.

   Bt2--19 to 28 inches; mixed, yellow (10YR 7/6 and 7/8) and very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly silty clay loam; moderate medium platy structure parting to moderate very fine angular blocky; friable; few medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 30 percent soft mudstone paragravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); gradual wavy boundary.

   Bt3--28 to 42 inches; mixed, yellow (10YR 7/6 and 7/8) very gravelly silty clay; strong thick platy structure parting to strong medium platy and strong fine angular blocky; firm; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common fine distinct clay films on faces of peds; 40 percent soft mudstone paragravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 35 or more inches)

   2Cd--42 to 80 inches; soft, dense, clayey, stratified mudstone

TYPE LOCATION: Texas County, Missouri; about 8 miles southeast of Cabool; 960 feet north and 320 feet west of the SE corner of section 29, T. 28 N., R. 9 W; Willow Springs North USGS quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 04 minutes 16 seconds N. and longitude 91 degrees 56 minutes 45 seconds W.

  Hue: 10YR
  Value: 3 to 6
  Chroma: 2 to 4
  Fine earth: silt loam, loam
  Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent gravel
  Reaction: moderately acid to very strongly acid

E horizon
  Hue: 10YR
  Value: 4 to 6
  Chroma: 3 to 6

  Rock fragments: 5 to 50 percent gravel
  Reaction: strongly acid or very strongly acid

Upper Bt horizon
  Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR
  Value: 4 to 8
  Chroma: 2 to 8
  Fine earth: silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay
  Rock fragments: 0 to 35 percent gravel

  Value: 5 to 8
  Chroma: 6 or 8
  Fine earth: silty clay, clay
  Rock fragments: 10 to 60 percent gravel
  Reaction: strongly acid to extremely acid

2Cd horizon: soft, dense, clayey, stratified mudstone

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Littlejoe, (T)Penhook, and (T) Strawfield series. Littlejoe soils have mica flakes throughout the series control section. Penhook soils are very deep.  Strawfield soil have hard, unweathered phyllite at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tick soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping narrow ridgetops and moderately steep to very steep side slopes of ridges. They formed in gravelly slope alluvium over dense, clayey mudstone. Slopes range from 3 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,200 to 1,550 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Doniphan, Mano, Ocie, Poynor and Viburnum series. Doniphan and Poynor soils are very deep and on similar landscape positions. Mano and Ocie soils formed in residuum from dolomite, have contrasting particle size control sections and are on lower side slopes below the Tick soils. Viburnum soils are very deep, clayey, and are on broad, level ridgetops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Runoff is medium to very high. Permeability is moderately slow, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for timber production. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods. A few areas are used for hay and pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks Highlands region (MLRA 116A) of south-central Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. The series is of moderate extent.
