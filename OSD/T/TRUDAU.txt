TRUDAU SERIES 

The Trudau series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, flood-plain steps, drainageways and knolls.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Trudau loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A--0 to 2 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak very fine platy structure parting to moderate very fine granules; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 8 inches thick) 

    Bw--2 to 14 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; few fine masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary. (8 to 15 inches thick) 

    Bk--14 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many irregular and tubular pores; common fine and medium masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bkz--30 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam stratified with sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many irregular pores; common fine salt crystals; common fine and medium masses of calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)
