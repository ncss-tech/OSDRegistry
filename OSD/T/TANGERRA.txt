COMPETING SERIES: There are the no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: ash influenced loess over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits
Landform: depressions on moraines and outwash plains 
Slope: 0 to 6 percent
Mean annual temperature: about 34 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: about 25 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Soldotna and Qutal soils. Soldotna soils are well drained and are on terraces. Qutal soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on till plains.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, very high runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and very high in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is *.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 224 Cook Inlet Lowlands, South-central Alaska, The series is of moderate extent.
