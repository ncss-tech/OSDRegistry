TUBBS HOLLOW SERIES

The Tubbs Hollow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from red sandstone or red siltstone. Tubbs Hollow soils are on mountain backslopes, summits and shoulders. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Tubbs Hollow gravelly loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 3 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick)

 Bw1--3 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly-sticky and slightly-plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick)

 Bw2--12 to 25 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) extremely cobbly loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly-sticky and non-plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 15 percent gravel, 60 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4). (9 to 13 inches thick)

 R--25 inches; fractured red sandstone.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the: 
(01/29/2008 - competing section will be updated once all the cryepts have been reclassified to the 10th edtion)

Holdon (T) (CA) - are deep to a lithic contact and have fragmental material at 20 to 40 inches.
Ketchum (ID) - are very deep.
Longhike (T) (NV) - are moderately deep to a Cr horizon.
Muiral (NV) - have O and Bk horizons.
Poso (T) (ID) - are very deep and have Bk horizons.
Yankeefork (ID) - are very deep. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: mountain backslopes, summits and shoulders; generally northerly or easterly aspects
Elevation: 6,600 to 7,850 feet
Slope: 2 to 60 percent
Parent material: red sandstone
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry, summers. 
Average annual precipitation: 13 to 18 inches
Average annual temperature: 36 to 40 degrees F. 
Frost-free season: 50 to 70 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cutoff, Dry Canyon, Sheep Creek and Taylow series.
Cutoff - are on similar landscape positions but with southerly aspects and lower elevations, have Bk horizons and have a frigid temperature regime.
Dry Canyon - are on similar or lower landscape positions, have argillic horizons, are deep and have a frigid temperature regime.
Sheepcreek - are on backslopes at lower landscape positions, have argillic and Bk horizons and have a frigid temperature regime..
Taylow -  are on similar positions at lower elevations or on southerly aspects, are shallow to bedrock and have a frigid temperature regime 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to high surface runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tubbs Hollow soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly low sage, stunted mountain big sage, bluebunch wheatgrass, twisted leaf rabbitbrush, antelope bitterbrush, goldenrod, buckwheat and prickly pear.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. These soils are of small extent in MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008. The name is from a nearby canyon.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (the A horizon and part of the Bw1 horizon). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 3 to 25 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons). 
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 inches to the lithic contact at 25 inches (part of the Bw1 horizon and the Bw2 horizon) 

01/29/2008 - Due to changes in soil taxonomy from the 9th to the 10th edition, the classification changed from Xeric Eutrocryepts to Xeric Haplocryepts.
