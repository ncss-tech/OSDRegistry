TEEQUEE SERIES

The Teequee series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Teequee soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Torrertic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Teequee cobbly clay loam, on a west, southwest facing, convex, 20 percent slope in at an elevation of 7,260 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 12, 1999, the soil was moist from 0 to 20 inches.
The surface is covered by about 20 percent gravel and10 percent cobbles.  The fragments are sandstone.  About 20 percent is bare ground and 25 percent is covered by litter under trees.

  A--0 to 2 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) cobbly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular; soft, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 10 percent cobble, 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

  Bt--2 to 8 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of ped ; 10 percent pararock pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

(9 to 20 inches thick)

  Btkss2--31 to 51 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak and moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; slightly effervescent; few very fine tubular pores; common slickensides; common distinct clay films on faces of ped ; common fine soft carbonate seams; 10 percent pararock pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 20 inches thick)

  Cr--51 to 61 inches; gray (7.5YR 5/1) clay, dark gray (7.5YR 4/1) moist; soft weathered shale.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Demar and Thurlow series.  Demar soils have early summer moisture peaks.  Thurlow soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale
Landform: hillslopes, structural benches
Slopes: 1 to 55 percent
Elevation: 6,950 to 7,650 feet
Mean annual temperature: 45 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 18 inches
Precipitation pattern: Precipitation falls year round but peaks in July and August, and declines in spring.  April, May, and June are the driest months.  Total snowfall averages about 4 to 5 feet with snowmelt lasting through April.
Frost-free period: 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Menefee, Orlie, and Vessilla series.  The Menefee soils are shallow, do not have argillic horizons and are on shoulders and upper hillslopes .  The Orlie soils are very deep, have less clay and are on valley sides.  The Vessilla soils are shallow to hard sandstone and are on ridges and hillslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, rapid  runoff, slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central New Mexico; RM-2 subresource area, MLRA 36 The series is of small extent.
