COMPETING SERIES: 
None 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain estuaries 
Landform: Mainland coves or submerged wave-cut headlands of Holocene age 
Parent Material: Submerged organic materials formed at or near sea level when sea level was at a lower elevation 
Slope: 0 to 0.25 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature:  50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature:  52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Water Regime: Tidal, 1.0 to 3.0 feet tidal range
Water Salinity Range: 26 to 32 ppt 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Tingles soils--are fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments on lagoon bottoms.
Southpoint soils--are fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments, relict marsh sediments, and upland subaerial soils on mainland coves and submerged wave-cut headlands.  Southpoint soils do not have thick organic materials within 16 inches (40 centimeters) of the soil surface.
Truitt soils--are fine-silty soils formed in lagoonal sediments over buried organic horizons that formed at or near sea level when sea level was at a lower elevation, on submerged wave-cut headlands or mainland coves.  The buried organic materials occur below 40 inches (1 meter) and are greater than 2 inches (5 centimeters) thick. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Subaqueous and peraquic soil moisture regime
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high to high in the organic horizons and low to moderately low in the mineral horizons 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are un-vegetated and function as estuarine benthic wildlife habitat is limited. Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish are rare.  Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima). Vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 5 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
Distribution: Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and possibly Virginia 
Extent: Small

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina 

SERIES PROPOSED: Worcester County, Maryland, 2007

REMARKS: 
Soil is permanently submerged with salt or brackish water. The presence of sulfidic material within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for acid sulfate drainage if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Peraquic feature - Positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface. (Under 73 inches (185 centimeters) of salt water)
Sulfidic materials - within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface (the A, Cg, and Oa horizons).
