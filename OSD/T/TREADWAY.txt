TREADWAY SERIES

The Treadway series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in recent calcareous, gypsiferous, and saline clayey slope alluvium derived from Permian age redbed shale and claystone. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on toe slopes and alluvial fans of uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.

Tilvern and Throck series: These soils are less than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have vertic properties.
Mangum series: These soils occur on flood plains and have vertic properties. 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: recent calcareous, gypsiferous, and saline clayey slope alluvium derived from Permian age redbed shale and claystone
Landform: toe slopes and alluvial fans on pediments below areas of raw outcrops or escarpments of Permian age redbeds.
Slope: 0 to 3 percent
Mean annual air temperature range: 57 to 64 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation range: 22 to 30 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Beckman, Clairemont, Hayfork, Knoco, Mangum, Nipsum, Spur, and Vernon series. 
Beckman, Hayfork, and Mangum series: These soils occur on slightly lower flood plains.
Clairemont and Spur series: These soils occur on lower flood plains and contain less than 35 percent clay content in the particle-size control section.
Knoco and Vernon series: These soils occur on higher areas and have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.
Nipsum series: These soils occur on similar areas, but have a mollic epipedon. 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is high on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 3 percent slopes. The soil is rarely moistened to below 20 inches. These soils have none to frequent overland flow for very brief periods from April to October. 
USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly as grazing land for beef cattle. The native vegetation is a sparse cover of short grasses, prickly pear cactus, and various thorny shrubs such as mesquite and lote bush. 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central rolling red plains of Oklahoma and Texas; LRR H; MLRAs Central Rolling Red Plains, Western Part (78B) andCentral Rolling Red Plains, Eastern Part (78C); Moderate extent
