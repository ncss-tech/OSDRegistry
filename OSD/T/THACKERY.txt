THACKERY SERIES

The Thackery series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy material and the underlying calcareous outwash. The soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bogart, Centerburg, Cygnet, Haney, Houcktown, Jenera, Jugtown, Nicely, Reaville, Scattersville, Swampoodle, Tuscola, Vallonia (T), Vanlue, and Williamstown series. Bogart soils have rock fragments dominantly of sandstone, shale, and quartz. Centerburg, Cygnet, Houcktown, Jenera, Tuscola, Vallonia, Vanlue, and Williamstown soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. In addition, Cygnet and Houcktown soils have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section. Haney soils have more than 2 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Jugtown, Nicely, Scattersville, and Swampoodle soils do not have carbonates within 140 cm (55 inches). Reaville soils have bedrock within 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Thackery soils are on nearly level to gently undulating outwash plains and stream terraces of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in loamy material and the underlying calcareous outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 838 to 1067 mm (33 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 366 meters (600 to 1200 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Fox and Ockley soils, the somewhat poorly drained Sleeth soils, and the very poorly drained Westland soils. Fox and Ockley soils are on higher topographic positions. Sleeth and Westland soils are on depressions and swales.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 to 76 cm (1.0 to 2.5 feet) between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum, and rapid or very rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Thackery soils are cultivated. Principal crops include corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, and meadows of grass-legume mixtures. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 111A, 111B (sandy substratum phase), 111D, 111E, and 114A in central and western Ohio; MLRAs 111C and 111D in western Indiana; and MLRA 95B in southern Wisconsin. The type location is in MLRA 111D. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Fairfield County, Ohio, 1956.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 cm (Ap, E horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 30 to 102 cm (Bt, 2Bt, 2Btg horizons).
Aquic conditions: redox features visible in horizons between a depth of 20 and 127 cm.

Sandy substratum and till substratum phases are recognized. Till substratum phases with till above 152 cm (60 inches) have a perched high water table and will be recorrelated to new series when their areas of use are updated.
