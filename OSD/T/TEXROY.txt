TEXROY SERIES

The Texroy series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy alluvial sediments derived from the upper part of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping terraces along the Canadian, Cimmaron, and Red River basins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Pachic Argiustolls

Guadalupe soils are on floodplains and do not have calcic horizons.
Manson soils are on rolling plains and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.
Mobeetie soils are on higher landscape positions and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.
Plemons soils are on rolling plains and have an ochric epipedon.
Potter and Veal soils are on higher landscape positions and have carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Moderate permeability.  Surface runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes and low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION:  This soil is primarily used for rangeland and wildlife but, where cultivated, the principle crops are grain sorghum, winter wheat, and forage crops.  Climax vegetation is dominated by blue grama, with lesser amounts of buffalograss, tobosa, vine-mesquite, Arizona cottontop, silver bluestem, western wheatgrass, white tridens, ephedra, condalias, wolfberry, gayfeather, gauras, greenthread, ratany, and heath aster.  This soil has been correlated to the Clay Loam (077EY051TX) range site in MLRA-77E.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains Breaks of Texas and Oklahoma (MLRA-77E in LRR H).  The series is of minor extent.
