TATIYEE SERIES

The Tatiyee series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from basalt, ash, and cinders.  Tatiyee soils have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tatiyee gravelly loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 3 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 12 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine interstitial and tubular pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 22 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist, many large faint dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) krotovina, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist, and few fine faint strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) features; weak fine and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine roots; few very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; slightly acid (pH 6.3); abrupt wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    Bt2--22 to 30 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 22 inches thick)

    Bt3--30 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; very few fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; few faint clay films on rock faces; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION: Apache County, Arizona. Northeast 1/4 of section 11, T.7 N., R.26 E., on Big Cienega.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Driest during May and June.  Typic ustic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 39 to 46 degrees F.  

Mean summer soil temperature is less than 59 degrees F.

Rock Fragments: averages more than 35 percent in the control section

Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

Organic Matter: 2 to 10 percent in the upper part

A horizons
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 or 2, dry or moist

Bt horizons
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR
Texture:  clay loam, clay (averages more than 35 percent clay in the control section; ranges to 27 percent in the lower part)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alamaditas (CO), Fardraw (CO), Kolob (UT), Showalter (UT), and Sirref (UT) soils. 
Alamaditas: have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.
Fardraw soils: formed in alluvium, outwash and till derived from mixed sources, but principally of granitic and volcanic origin
Kolob: have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.
Showalter and Sirref: have horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tatiyee soils have slopes of 0 to 8 percent but are dominantly 1 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from basalt, ash and cinders.  Elevations range from 7,800 to 10,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brolliar, Gordo, Friana, Sizer and Sponseller series.  Sponseller and Gordo soils are fine-loamy.   Brolliar and Friana soils are fine textured.  Sizer soils are fine-loamy over fragmental.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation consists of Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Kentucky bluegrass, sedges, weeds and native flowers.  In Utah, vegetation includes big sagebrush, bitterbrush, bluebunch Wheatgrass and mutton bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona and Southern Utah.  The series is moderately extensive. MLRA 39.
