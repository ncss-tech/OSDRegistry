TOPAZMILL SERIES

The Topazmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foot slopes and hill sides of uplands. They formed in loamy slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Typic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON: Topazmill fine sandy loam, 8 to 15 percent slopes, in a fescue pasture at an elevation of 670 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine roots throughout; many very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 6.9); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

   2Bt3--26 to 37 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine tubular pores; many coarse prominent discontinuous dark red (2.5YR 3/6) and common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay films on faces of peds; few fine prominent discontinuous pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay depletions on faces of peds; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); clear smooth boundary. 

   2Bt4--37 to 57 inches; mixed dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine tubular pores; common coarse continuous red (10R 4/6) clay films on faces of peds; many coarse pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay depletions; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); gradual smooth boundary. 

   2Bt5--57 to 80 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) clay loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many fine tubular and irregular pores; many medium prominent discontinuous strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent discontinuous pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay depletions on faces of peds; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); gradual smooth boundary. (combined thickness of the Bt and 2Bt horizon is 62 or more inches)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cottonbend, Egyptgrove, Fanchon, McClung, Nolichucky, Taterhill, Trimble, and Wyrick series. Cottonbend, Fanchon, Taterhill, and Wyrick soils have more silt and less sand in the particle-size control section. Egyptgrove soils have a Btd horizon. McClung and Trimble sois do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Nolichucky soils have rounded sandstone and quartzite fragments in the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Topazmill soils are on footslopes and side slopes of uplands. They formed in loamy slope alluvium and colluvium. Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent. Elevations are commonly 550 to 1,200 feet. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bender, Coulstone, Relfe, Sandbur, Yelton, and Zanoni series. Bender and Coulstone soils are on side slopes and are loamy skeletal. Relfe soils are sandy-skeletal. Sandbur soils are coarse-loamy. Both of these soils are on floodplains. Yelton soils have a fragpan and are on similar landscape positions. Zanoni soils are coarse-loamy and are on stream terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is low to high. Permeability is moderate, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for pasture and hay production. The native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozark Highland region (MLRA 116A) of southern Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. The series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Ozark County, Missouri, 2003. The name comes from a small community in the area.

REMARKS: These soils were previously included in the Lecoma and Holstein series in mapping in southern Missouri. These soils are alfisols.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (Ap and BA horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 80 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons) 

ADDITIONAL DATA: These soils are mapped primarily in the Roubidoux and upper Gasconade geologic formations.
