TAXONOMIC CLASS: 

TYPICAL PEDON: Turbellina peat - on a slope of 3 percent under sedge wet meadow. (All colors are for moist soil)

	Oi--0 to 9inches (0 to 23 cm); dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) peat; many very fine and fine roots; extremely acid (pH 4.4); abrupt wavy boundary.

	Cg/Oejj--9 to 14 inches (23 to 36 cm); dark gray (5Y 4/1) and very dusky red (2.5YR 2.5/2) silt loam; massive; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; 10 mm yellowish red (5YR 4/6) high chroma redox concentrations (approximately 40 percent of horizon); strongly acid (pH 5.1); abrupt broken boundary.

        Cf--14 to 60 inches (36 to 152 cm); dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) permanently frozen silt loam; strongly acid (pH 5.1).

TYPE LOCATION: Delta River Area, Alaska; in the Tangle Lakes area about 4.3 miles southwest of Rand Tangle Lake, Alaska; UTM coordinates: Zone 6, Easting 546167, Northing 6986721.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Mean summer soil temperature: 36 to 39 degrees F. (2 to 4 degrees C)
Depth to permafrost: 14 to 25 inches (36 to 64 cm)

Oi horizon and Oe part of Cg/Oejj horizon:
Colorhue of 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 2 to 4
Texturepeat, mucky peat
Organic matter content65 to 90 percent
Reactionultra acid to strongly acid

Cg horizon or Cg part of Cg/Oa horizon:

Reactionextremely acid to strongly acid

Cf horizon:
Colorhue of 10YR or 2.5Y; chroma of 2 or 3
Clay content0 to 10 percent
Silt content55 to 75 percent
Sand content15 to 35 percent
Rock fragments0 to 5 percent rounded gravel; 0 to 2 percent rounded cobbles
Reactionextremely acid to strongly acid

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Goldstream, Saulich, and Windy Creek soils. Goldstream, Saulich, and Windy Creek soils have a presumed mean annual summer soil temperature warmer than 36 degrees F (2) degrees C.).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landforms: hills; outwash plains
Parent material: silty cryoturbate deposits
Elevation: 2,546 to 3,012 feet (776 to 918 m)
Slope: 0 to 12 percent
Annual precipitation: 22 to 31 inches (564 to 776 mm)
Annual temperature: 25 degrees F (-4 degrees C)
Frost-free period: 50 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Kuswash and Schleyer soils. Kuswash soils are poorly drained, shallow to permafrost, and occur on outwash plains. Schleyer soils are somewhat excessively drained, very deep, and occur on hill, mountain, outwash plains, and terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, negligible runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high above the permafrost and very low in the permafrost.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for wildlife habitat and recreation. Native vegetation is sedge wet meadow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 228, Interior Alaska Mountains, Alaska. The series is of small extent.
