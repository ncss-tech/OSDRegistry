THERESA SERIES

The Theresa series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to a densic contact with till. These soils formed in loess and in the underlying loamy till on drumlins and ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the  Bluemount, Douds, Grellton, Kendallville, Kiever, Letort, Lindley, Mandeville, McHenry, Mifflin, Nodine, Norden, Ott, Pecatonica, Plumcreek, Renova, Rockbridge, Westville, Whalan, and Wykoff series.  None of these soils have a densic contact within the series control section. In addition, Bluemount and Whalan soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Douds, Kliever, Letort, Lindley, Nodine, Plumcreek, Rockbridge, and Wykoff soils do not have carbonates within the series control section; Mandeville and Norden soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches), and Ott soils at a depth of 38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 inches); and Mifflin soils have a lithic contact at 102 to 140 cm (40 to 55 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Theresa soils are on convex slopes of drumlins and ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Theresa soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 864 mm (28 to 34 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from approximately 7.2 to 10.6 degrees C (45 to 51 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hochheim, Lamartine, and Mayville soils that are on similar landscapes.  The well drained Hochheim soils commonly occupy steeper slopes and have sola less than 61 cm (24 inches) thick.  The moderately well drained Mayville and somewhat poorly drained Lamartine soils commonly occupy gentler slopes or level sites in nearby areas where the loess mantle is more than 56 cm (22 inches) thick.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and slow in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grains, soybeans, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland and some for woodland.  Native vegetation is maple-basswood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  MLRAs 95A, 95B, and 110 in southeastern Wisconsin.  Theresa soils are extensive.
