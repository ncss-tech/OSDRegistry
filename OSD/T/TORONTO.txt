TORONTO SERIES

The Toronto series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Udollic Epiaqualfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Toronto silt loam, on a 1 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 223 meters (730 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 23 cm (9 inches); black (10YR 2/1) silt loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; common fine and very fine roots; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [18 to 23 cm (7 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bt3--64 to 81 cm (25 to 32 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay loam; moderate coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm; few fine roots; common distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay films on faces of peds; common medium faint grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 38 to 84 cm (15 to 33 inches).]

 2BCt--81 to 135 cm (32 to 53 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay films on faces of peds; many medium distinct gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions in the matrix; many medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [(5 to 25 inches) thick]

 2C--135 to 152 cm (53 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam; massive; firm; common fine distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions in the matrix; common fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Herbert series. Herbert soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of soil development.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toronto soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Toronto soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1143 mm (29 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 13.9 degrees C (46 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 160 to 200 days. Elevation is 104 to 396 meters (340 to 1,300 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chalmers, Drummer, Fincastle, Millbrook, Raub and Wingate soils. The poorly drained Chalmers and Drummer soils are in depressions. The moderately well drained Wingate soils are on higher lying rises. Fincastle soils have lighter colored surface layers and are on similar landscape positions. Millbrook soils are on similar landscape positions but have the lower part of the sola formed in outwash. Raub soils are on similar landscape positions but have mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) during the fall and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all areas are cropped to corn and soybeans. Wheat is the principal small grain. Native vegetation is mixed forest and prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 108A, 110, 111C, and 111D in west central Indiana and eastern Illinois. The series is of moderate extent.
