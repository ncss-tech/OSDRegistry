TEABRUSH SERIES

The Teabrush series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from calcareous sandstone and shale.  Teabrush soils are on alluvial flats and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 150 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm.

This series was formerly included with the Moffat series.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
