TORNING SERIES

The Torning series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in locally sorted outwash sediments on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 25 inches. Mean annual air temperature 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciudolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Torning fine sandy loam, on a 3 percent convex slope, on an outwash plain, in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist conditions unless otherwise noted.) 

 Ap--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

 Bk1--8 to 12 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine roots; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

 Bk2--12 to 30 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) fine sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 6 to 30 inches.) 

 C--30 to 80 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) fine sand; single grain; loose; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Swift County, Minnesota; 3 miles southeast of Appleton; located about 760 feet south and 400 feet east of the northwest corner of section 31, T. 120 N., R. 42 W.; USGS Milan NW topographic quadrangle; lat. 45 degrees 09 minutes 53 seconds W. and long. 95 degrees 58 minutes 42 seconds W., NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches. The series control section has 8 to 18 percent clay. The content of sand coarser than very fine sand exceeds 15 percent. These soils do not have rock fragments in the particle-size control section. These soils have carbonates in all parts. 

The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, moist and 4 or 5, dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent. 

The Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 12 to 30 percent. 

The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sand, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent. 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Esmond series. Esmond series contains 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section and is formed in glacial till. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Torning soils have convex and linear slopes with gradient of 2 to 15 percent on outwash plains. They developed in locally sorted outwash sediments of Late Wisconsin in age. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 29 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 120 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 990 to 1,950 feet above sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The main ones are the Egeland and Arveson soils. Well drained Egeland soils do not have carbonates throughout. Poorly drained Arveson soils are on lower-lying terrain. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is medium. The permeability is moderately rapid. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are cultivated; corn, soybeans, and small grains are the principal crops. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western Minnesota. Inextensive.
