TURKEYTRACK SERIES

The Turkeytrack series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces and fan terraces of plateaus.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Paleustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Turkeytrack gravelly loam - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oi--0 to 1 inches; recent and slightly decomposed pine litter.

TYPE LOCATION:  Coconino County, Arizona; about 1000 feet west and 300 feet south of the northeast corner of Section 31,. T. 29 N., R. 7 W.; about 1 mile northwest of Thorton Lookout on the Hualapai Indian Reservation.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-March.  Driest during May and June.  Approximately 60 percent of the precipitation occurs in the winter months. Typic ustic soil moisture regime.  

Rock fragments: averages 10 to 30 percent in the particle size control section

Soil temperature: 48 to 52 degrees F.

Linear extensibility: 6.0 cm or more from the surface horizon to 40 inches

A horizon
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry

Bw horizon
Value: 3 through 5 dry
Texture: loam, clay loam

Bt horizon
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist
Texture: clay, sandy clay (40 to 60 percent clay).  15 percent or more (absolute) clay increase at the upper boundary within a vertical distance of 1 inch

Btk horizon
Value: 4 or 5 dry
Texture: clay, sandy clay
Rock fragments: ranges from 10 to 55 percent gravel and cobble
Calcium carbonate equivalent: less than 15 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Turkeytrack soils are on stream terraces and fan terraces of plateaus.  Elevation is 6500 to 6900 feet.  These soils formed in old alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Sponiker, Pinntank, Pocomate, and Retsover soils.  Sponiker soils have thick mollic epipedons.  Pinntank soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Pocomate soils are shallow to bedrock.  Retsover soils lack a mollic epipedon and are deep to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Turkeytrack soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is ponderosa pine, mountain big sagebrush, blue grama, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern Arizona.  This series is not extensive. MLRA 35.
