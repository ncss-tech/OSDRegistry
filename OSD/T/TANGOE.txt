TANGOE SERIES

Depth class: very deep
Drainage class poorly or somewhat poorly
Parent material: stratified alluvium overlying very gravelly alluvium or loamy alluvium over sandy and gravelly alluvium
Landform: floodplains
Slopes: 0 to 8 percent
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 26 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 52 inches

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Oxyaquic Cryorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Tangoe sandy loam on a 0 percent slope under low willow shrub vegetation at 2500 feet elevation.  (All colors are for moist soil)

    Oe--1 inch to 0; black (10YR 2/1) peat; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick)

    AC1--0 to 1 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

    AC2--1 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) stratified sand through silt with composite texture of sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine distinct olive gray (5Y 4/2) redox depletions and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    2C1--8 to 16 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 45 percent rounded gravel and 15 percent rounded cobble; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick)

    2C2--16 to 60 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) extremely gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; 45 percent rounded gravel and 15 percent rounded cobble; slightly acid (pH 6.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Gulkana River Area, Alaska; about 22 miles north of Sourdough; the SE1/4 of the NE1/4 of section 6, T.12N., R.2E., Copper River Meridian. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Stratified loamy thickness: 2 to 10 inches with coarse-loamy particle size
Particle size control section: sandy skeletal
Saturated conditions: 0 to 40 inches, for more than one month during May through September
Soil reaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline throughout the profile

AC horizon:
Color: hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4; chroma of 1 to 3
Texture: stratified sand through silt with composite texture of fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam

2C horizon:
Color: variegated sand and gravel
Texture: coarse sand, loamy sand modified by 35 to 70 percent total coarse fragments; 30 to 60 percent rounded gravel, 5 to 30 percent rounded cobble, pockets and strata of sand and silt are common in this horizon.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this classification.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: stratified alluvium overlying very gravelly alluvium or loamy alluvium over sandy and gravelly alluvium
Landform: floodplains
Slopes: 0 to 8 percent
Mean annual temperature: 23 to 26 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 16 to 52 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly or somewhat poorly drained, low to negligible runoff. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the profile and high or very in the gravelly underlying material. Tangoe soils are subject to flooding. These soils have seasonally high water tables that are very shallow to moderately deep but lack redoximorphic features in the profile 

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil have vegetation consisting of low willow shrub.  Primary land use includes recreation and wildlife habitat.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 227, Copper River Basin, South-central, Alaska. The soil is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: WASILLA, ALASKA

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Gulkana River Area, Alaska.  1999.

REMARKS: Diagnostic features recognized in this profile include:
No diagnostic horizons
Saturated within 100 cm of the surface for more than one month during the year
Particle size control section: coarse-loamy 0 to 8 inches; sandy-skeletal particle size from 8 to 60 inches
Temperature regime: cryic

A wet phase is designated where the seasonally high water table is within 10 inches or 25 centimeters of the soil surface.
