TETONIA SERIES

The Tetonia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess. Tetonia soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tetonia silt loam, cultivated, on a hill with 9 percent slope at an elevation of 1844 meters. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Ap--0 to 22 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 30 cm thick)

	AB--22 to 56 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; many organic stains on ped faces; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 34 cm thick)

	Bw--56 to 72 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 30 cm thick)

	Bk1--72 to 100 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common calcium carbonate masses on surfaces along pores and in matrix; many insects casts; strongly effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary. (11 to 50 cm thick)

	Bk2--100 to 128 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common calcium carbonate masses; common insects casts; strongly effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); gradual wavy boundary. (22 to 55 cm thick)

	Bk3--128 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine tubular pores; common calcium carbonate masses; strongly effervescent (25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

TYPE LOCATION: Teton County, Idaho; about 16 kilometers northwest of Tetonia; 446 meters north and 485 meters east of the southwest corner of section 36, T. 7 N., R. 43 E.;  Drummond USGS topographic quadrangle; lat. 43 degrees, 53 minutes, 12.5 seconds N. and long. 111 degrees, 19 minutes, 58.1 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mollic epipedon thickness: 40 to 64 cm
Particle-size control section: 10 to 20 percent total clay (weighted average is less then 18 percent) and less that 15 percent fine sand and coarser
Particle-size control section carbonate clay: 0 to 8 percent
Depth to calcic horizon: 40 to 80 cm				
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 25 percent in the calcic horizon
Mean annual soil temperature: 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C. (cryic soil temperature regime)
Mean summer soil temperature: 10.0 to 15.0 degrees C.
Moisture control section: dry throughout for 60 to90 consecutive days after the summer solstice (xeric)

Ap or A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR moist
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry and moist

AB horizon
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR moist

Bw horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

Bk horizon
Value: 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 3 or 4 moist
Effervescence: slight to violent (strong or violent in the calcic horizon)
Secondary carbonates: 2 to 30 percent
Reaction: moderately to strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no soil series in the family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
  Landscape: plateaus, mountain ranges, alluvial plains, outwash plains,
  foothills, plains, tablelands
  Landform: hills, mountain slopes, hillslopes, and plateaus
  Elevation: 1615 to 2134 meters
  Slope: 0 to 65 percent
  Parent material: loess
  Mean annual air temperature: 2.8 to 5.0 degrees C.
  Mean annual precipitation: 305 to 559 mm
  Frost free period: 20 to 55 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Rin, Lostine, Kucera, Iphil, and Ririe soils. All of these soils occur on the same landforms. Rin soils have a cryic soil temperature regime, are on north slopes, and do not have a calcic horizon. Lostine, Kucera, Iphil, and Ririe soils are on south slopes and have a frigid soil temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage class: well
Runoff: medium
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major uses: dryland winter wheat, barley, oats, alfalfa, hay, and grazing; irrigated wheat, barley, seed potatoes, and range
Dominant native vegetation: bluebunch wheatgrass, Nevada bluegrass, Idaho fescue, needleandthread, and mountain big sagebrush

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Southeastern Idaho and Western Wyoming, MLRA 13 and 43B
Extent: these soils are moderately extensive

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Teton County, Idaho, 1972; Teton Area, Idaho-Wyoming Soil Survey

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from a depth of 0 to 56 cm
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 56 to 72 cm
Calcic horizon: from a depth of 72 to 152 cm
Particle-size control section: from a depth of 25 to 100 cm
Soil temperature regime: cryic
Soil moisture regime: xeric

In 2001, the classification was revised to coarse-silty, mixed, superactive Calcic Pachic Haplocryoll based on changes to Soil Taxonomy.  In 2008, the type location was moved to its present location because the old location was  correlated to a frigid soil.. 

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Typical pedon was not sampled.
