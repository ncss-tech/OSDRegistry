Tablebluff soils are on nearly level to gently sloping dissected uplifted alluvial terraces on hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1070 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tablebluff soils are on alluvial fans, eroded fan remnants and dissected alluvial terraces on hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.   The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Elevations are 10 to 430 meters (33 to 1400 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by cool, foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean precipitation is 900 to 1320 millimeters (36 to 52 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).  The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C.  The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C.  Frost free season is about 270 to 330 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hookton, Nanningcreek, and Timmons soils.  Hookton soils have redoximorphic features at 25 to 50 centimeters and have in the fraction less than 75mm, 15 percent or more particles with diameter of .1 to 75 mm and clay content of 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Nanningcreek and Timmons soils have a mean summer and mean winter temperature that differs by less than 6 degrees C, these soils have an isomesic soil temperature regime.   Timmons soils are on gently sloping, slightly dissected marine terraces.  Hookton soils are on alluvial fans, eroded fan remnants and dissected terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained, low to high runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are mainly used for pasture and hay.  Nearly all nearly level areas of this soil have had the native vegetation removed.  The native vegetation is estimated to have been redwood, grand fir, Sitka spruce, California laurel, red alder, willow, with an understory of blackberry, salmonberry, ferns and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt MLRA 4B.  The series is of small extent.
