TICONIC SERIES

The Ticonic series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in 18 to 36 inches of sandy alluvium and the underlying stratified loamy alluvium.

Haynie--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Ticonic soils, have a clay content of 15 to 18 percent throughout the particle-size control section, and have a frequently saturated zone between depths of 4 to 6 feet in normal years
Kenmoor--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Ticonic soils and have buried horizons within 20 to 38 inches which have a clay content of more than 35 percent
Sarpy--are in landscape positions similar to those of the Ticonic soils and have a clay content of 2 to 5 percent throughout the particle-size control section

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Drainage class--well drained--a saturated zone does not occur within a depth of 6 feet in normal years
Permeability--rapid in the sandy alluvium and moderate in the underlying stratified loamy alluvium
Surface runoff potential--low
Flooding--rare or occasional flooding for brief to long periods during the months of February to November in most years resulting from precipitation events and snowmelt and flooding from streambank overflow is limited where dams and levees protect areas

USE AND VEGETATION:
Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans and small grains. Some areas are irrigated. The native vegetation is big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, other grasses of the tall grass prairie and deciduous trees.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Monona County, Iowa, 1995.

REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 10 to 40 inches (C1, C2, C3, 2C4, and 2C5 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 60 inches (Ap, C1, C2, C3, 2C4, 2C5, and 2C6 horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon);
udic moisture regime.

Strongly contrasting particle-size class transition zone--the zone from a depth 23 to 28 inches (C3 horizon).

These soils were formerly included with the Sarpy soils and Mixed alluvial lands.

Cation-exchange class is inferred from lab data for similar soils in the surrounding area.

Taxonomy version--second edition, 1999.

The redoximorphic features in this profile are believed to be related to the moisture status of the materials at the time of deposition and not related to present day moisture status. The redoximorphic features in this profile were not considered in the current classification of the soil.
These soils are not saturated to the surface.
