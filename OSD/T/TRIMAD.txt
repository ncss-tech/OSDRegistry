TRIMAD SERIES

The Trimad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, basin floors, hills and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Trimad cobbly loam, native grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.1); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to fine strong subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 9 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coatings on gravel and cobbles, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 14 inches thick)

    Bk2--9 to 18 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; common fine vesicular pores, and few very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coatings on gravel and cobbles, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (6 to 25 inches thick)

    Bk3--18 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) extremely gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 50 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; calcium carbonate coatings on gravel and cobbles, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).
