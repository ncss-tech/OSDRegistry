COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Kenmoor and Sandover are similar soils. Kenmoor soils are sandy over clayey. Sandover soils lack cambic horizons and also lack carbonates throughout the control section for the calcareous class. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Treloar soils formed in Missouri River alluvium on flood plains and flood plain steps. They occur on nearly level, linear to convex areas and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1020 millimeters (35 to 40 inches). 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blake, Haynie, Kenmoor, Lowmo, Peers, and Sarpy soils. Blake, Haynie, Lowmo, and Peers soils contain less sand in the upper part of the control section, lack contrasting textures, and occur on similar landforms. Kenmoor soils have more clay in the lower part of the control section and are on similar landforms. Sarpy soils are better drained, lack contrasting textures and occur on similar but slightly higher landforms.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for runoff is negligible to low. Permeability is rapid in the upper part and moderate in the lower part. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) is 42 to 141 micrometers per second in the upper sandy part and 4-14 micrometers per second in the lower loamy part. In undisturbed areas an apparent water table has an upper limit of 51 to 100 centimeters (20 to 39 inches) during November to May in most years. These soils are subject to frequent and occasional flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for cultivated crops or alfalfa. Some areas have been abandoned. The native vegetation is trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Central Mississippi Valley Wooded Slopes, MLRA 115B, of east central Missouri. The series is of moderate extent. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Warren County, Missouri, 2009. 

REMARKS: These soils were formed primarily by levee failures and the resultant sand deposition from blow holes. Reclamation resulted in extremely variable soil horizons which change in very short distances. The name is from a small village in Warren County. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: orchic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 centimeters (7 inches) (Ap horizon); depth to strongly contrasting particle size  71 centimeters (28 inches) (top of 2Bw1 horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 71 to 114 centimeters (28 inches to 45 inches) (2Bw horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data; University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri; Pedon ID M0721903 is data for the OSD typical pedon; Pedon IDs M0707115, M0713907, M0721916, M0713909, M0718317, M0707108, M0702740, M0718905, M0718906, M9601901 and M0702725, are additional data used for the series range in characteristics.
