TURSON SERIES

The Turson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on flood-plains and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to about 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Oxyaquic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Turson loam, in meadows (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick)

    C--10 to 24 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; common fine faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; massive; hard, very friable; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 33 inches thick)

    2C--24 to 60 inches; very gravelly loamy sand or sand; strongly effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Wyoming; approximately 210 feet southeast of the west 1/4 corner of sec. 14, T. 32N, R. ll9W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Mean annual soil temperature - 32 to 46 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature - 40 to 58 degrees F.
Thickness of mollic epipedon - 7 to 15 inches thick
Depth to lithologic discontinuity - 20 to 40 inches to sand and gravel Depth to redox concentrations (seasonally high water table) - 7 to 15 inches 
Organic carbon - ranges from .8 to 5 percent in the surface horizons and decreases uniformly with depth

Control section:
Rock fragments - 0 to 35 percent in the upper part and 35 to 80 percent in the lower part
Textures - typically loam in the upper part 
Clay ranges - 18 to 35 percent
Silt ranges - 20 to 55 percent
Sand ranges - 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand

Note: Typically these soils are calcareous throughout but are noncalcareous in the upper 1 or 2 inches in some pedons.

A horizon
Hue: 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR; dry or moist
Value: 4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3; dry or moist
Reaction: pH 7.4 to 9.0

C horizon
Hue: 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR; dry or moist
Value: 5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4; dry or moist
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 2 to 8 percent
Reaction: pH 7.9 to 9.0

Note: Contains few small faint to common medium distinct redox concentrations.

COMPETING SERIES:
Truaxcreek (MT) - have a Bw horizon
Wisdom (MT) - have a Bw horizon

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform - flood-plains and stream terraces
Slope - 0 to 6 percent
Parent material - alluvium derived from mixed sources
Mean annual precipitation - about 18 inches with about equal amounts of precipitation occurring during most months
Mean annual air temperature - about 39 degrees F.
Mean summer temperature - about 58 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dipman and Thayne soils. Dipman soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick, are very poorly drained, and lack a sandy-skeletal substratum. Thayne soils lack a sandy-skeletal substratum and are well drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well-drained; moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid in the lower part. These soils have a fluctuating seasonal water table which rises into the C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used as native pastureland or for native hay meadows. Principal native vegetation is bluegrass, meadow fescue, willows and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Moderately extensive in high mountain valleys of Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho and Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 47.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Star Valley Area, Idaho and Wyoming, 1971.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 10 inches (A horizon)
Depth to redox concentrations - at 7 inches (C horizon)
Depth to lithologic discontinuity - at 24 inches (2C horizon)
Particle-size control section - from 10 to 40 inches (C, part of 2C horizons)
