TURRAH SERIES 

The Turrah series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Turrah silty clay loam, in hayland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted). 

    A1--0 to 4 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick) 

    A2--4 to 12 inches; black (10YR 2/1) clay, black (10YR 2/1) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; common fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry redox concentrations; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick) 

    Bg1--12 to 22 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common fine roots; many very fine pores; common black (10YR 2/1) organic stains; common medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry redox concentrations; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. 

    Bg2--22 to 38 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and very plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine pores; many fine and medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry redox concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bg horizon is 14 to 34 inches.) 

   2Cg--38 to 60 inches; gray (5Y 5/1) very gravelly sandy clay loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) dry; massive; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; 60 percent gravel; common fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) dry and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) dry redox concentrations; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).
