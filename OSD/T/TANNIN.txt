COMPETING SERIES: These are the Colestine, Eagreek, Holkat, Hugo, Hurlbut, and Littlesand  soils. Colestine soils are moderately deep to fractured metamorphic rock. Eagreek soils are derived from volcanic material. Holkat soils are moderately deep to soft metasedimentary rock. Hugo soils have soft bedrock between 100 and 150 centimeters. Hurlbut soils are moderately deep to soft metamorphosed sedimentary bedrock. Littlesand soils are moderately deep to soft fine-grained sandstone bedrock. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tannin soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes on mountain slopes. Slopes are 9 to 75 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1000 meters. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Burgsblock, Coolyork, and Rockyglen soils.  Burgsblock and Rockyglen soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Coolyork soils have mollic epipedons and contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Burgsblock soils occur on linear to convex positions. Rockyglen soils occur on slightly to strongly convex positions. Coolyork soils occur on linear to concave positions on backslopes 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to very high runoff; moderately low to moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation is tanoak, Douglas-fir, California black oak, Oregon white oak, pacific madrone, California huckleberry, and poison oak.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area. MLRA 5. The series is moderately extensive.
