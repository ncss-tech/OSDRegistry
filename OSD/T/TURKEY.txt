TURKEY SERIES

The Turkey series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils. These gently sloping to very gently sloping soils formed in sandy deposits of the Deweyville Formation of late Pleistocene to early Holocene age. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20.0 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1350 mm (53 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Turkey sand--woodland (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

    A--0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; many very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common fine and medium pores; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. (8 to 56 cm [3 to 22 in] thick)

    C2--25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; common very fine and fine, and few medium and coarse roots; common medium pores; common fine prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) iron stains with sharp boundaries; few fine pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) masses of clean sand along root channels; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    C3--51 to 84 cm (20 to 33 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; few very fine to medium roots; common medium pores; 3 percent fine and medium prominent brown (7.5YR 5/4) iron stains with sharp boundaries; few fine pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) masses of clean sand along root channels; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    C4--84 to 132 cm (33 to 52 in); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) sand; single grain; loose, very friable; common fine roots; common fine pores; 1 percnt fine and medium prominent pink (7.5YR 7/4) iron stains with clear boundaries on surfaces of peds; few fine prominent pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) masses of clean sand along root channels; very strongly acid; diffuse irregular boundary. (combined thickness of the C layers is 147 to 196 cm [58 to 77 in])

    C5--132 to 203 cm (52 to 80 in); strong brown (7.5YR 5/8); single grain; loose, very friable; common medium pores; few fine prominent pink (7.5YR 7/4) iron stains on surfaces of peds; few fine pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) masses of clean sand along root channels; very strongly acid.

Cainhoy soils are formed in sandy marine sediments; have a Bh horizon greater than 203 cm (80 in).  
Darden soils have 10 to 25 percent silt and clay in the control section. Foxworth soils have a fluctuating seasonal high water table.  
Glentosh soils have a mean annual precipitation less than 1168 mm (46 in).
Lakeland soils formed from eolian materials; are on steeper landforms.  
Mcneely soils are yellower than 7.5YR in the C layers.
Tonkawa soils occur in areas of mean annual precipitation ranging from 1016 to 1270 mm (40 to 50 in) section.  
Wando soils are well drained.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Babco (TX), Belrose (TX), McNeely (TX), and Tyden (TX) soils.
Babco soils: have a spodic horizon; on a similar landform but in a lower position.  
Belrose soils: have an argillic horizon; on a similar landform but in a lower position.  
McNeely soils: are yellower than 7.5YR; on a similar landform.  
Tyden soils: are very poorly drained; on a similar landform but in a lower concave position.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Turkey soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Runoff is very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used primarily for timber production and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is longleaf pine, sandjack and blackjack oak, sweetgum, yaupon, highbush blueberry, andropogons, panicums, and threeawns.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods of southeast Texas; LRR T; MLRA 152B.  The series is of small extent.
