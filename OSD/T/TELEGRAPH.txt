TELEGRAPH SERIES

The Telegraph series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. Telegraph soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 30 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

 C--137 to 200 centimeters; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; massive; moderately hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent subangular gravel, 5 percent subangular cobbles, and 15 percent paragravel; strongly acid (pH 5.1).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Telegraph soils are on linear to slightly convex positions on backslopes of mountains. Slopes are from 30 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 185 to 505 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sproulish, Gibsoncreek, and Redwohly soils. Sproulish soils lack a C horizon above 150 centimeters and lack argillic horizons. Gibsoncreek soils lack an argillic horizon. Redwohly soils have paragravel textures between 50 to 100 centimeters of the soil surface.  Sproulish soils are found on linear to slightly concave positions. Gibsoncreek soils are on linear to convex positions. Redwohly soils are located on convex positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for timber production, wildlife habitat, and for watershed. Natural vegetation is tanoak, Douglas-fir, Oregon white oak, Pacific madrone, coast redwood, and huckleberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt, MLRA 4B. These soils are of small extent.
