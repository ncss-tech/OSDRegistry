DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Distribution: Georgia, Alabama, and Florida
Extent: Moderate

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Auburn, Alabama.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:
Grady County, Georgia; 1908.

REMARKS: The type location was shifted 80 to 90 feet West due to a road widening project that destroyed original site.  The January 2026 revision changed the format.  No data was changed. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 28 centimeters (0 to 11 inches) (Apc horizon)
Argillic horizon--the zone from 28 to 165 centimeters (11 to 65 inches) (Btc1, Btc2, Btv1, Btv2, and BCt horizons)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx
Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 16, and Southern Cooperative Series Bulletin 148, May 1970, contains data from a pedon in the general area near the type location. Data on the typifying pedon is available through the National Soil Survey Laboratory and is identified as pedon S81GA277011 and NSSL Nos. 81P2672-2678.
