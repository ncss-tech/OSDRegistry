TOPIA SERIES

The Topia series consists of well drained, very slowly permeable soils that are moderately deep over limestone bedrock. The soils formed in clayey pedisediment over residuum from limestone bedrock. The soils occur on nearly level to gently undulating ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Very-fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Vertic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Topia clay--rangeland.

Brackett, Denton, Eckrant, Kavett, San Saba, and Tarrant soils do not have an argillic horizon. In addition, Brackett, Eckrant, Kavett, and Tarrant soils are less than 51 cm (20 in) deep to bedrock.
Pratley soils: are calcareous throughout and have less than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
San Saba soils: have intersecting slickensides.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Permeability is very slow. Runoff is high on 0 to 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mainly rangeland, but a few areas are used for growing small grains and grain sorghums.  Present vegetation includes live oak, cedar, post oak, Texas persimmon, curlymesquite, Texas wintergrass, fall witchgrass, sideoats grama, little bluestem, and Indiangrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Edwards Plateau and Grand Prairie of Texas.  Topia soils are of moderate extent with about 13,000 acres.
