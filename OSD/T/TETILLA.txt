TETILLA SERIES

The Tetilla series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from loess, volcanic ash, and basalt.  Tetilla soils are on undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Almagre, Monogram, Snapill, and Witt series.
Almagre soils are deep to bedrock and more moist in spring.
Monogram soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments.
Snapill soils are deep to bedrock and have a calcic horizon above 40 inches.
Witt soils have a calcic horizon above 40 inches and less than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tetilla soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of undulating plateaus.  They formed in slope alluvium derived from Quaternary loess and volcanic ash and Tertiary basalt.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Calabasas, Panky, and Zepol soils.  Calabasas soils have a calcic horizon and durinodes within 40 inches overlying a duripan within 60 inches, and occur on summits of undulting plateaus.  Panky soils are fine-loamy, have upper argillic horizons that contain more than 35 percent clay, and occur on summits of erosional fan remnants.  Zepol soils are fine-silty, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on narrow flood plains of valley floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and moderately rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tetilla soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, ring muhly, galleta, sand dropseed, threeawn, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Cinder(R036XB117NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Tetilla soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2008.  Tetilla is a local place name taken from Tetilla Peak, a prominent butte in southwestern Santa Fe County.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 3 inches. (AE horizon)
Argillic horizon - The zone from 3 to about 21 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Calcic horizon - The zone from 57 to about 77 inches. (Bk1 horizon)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of Bt2 and Btk1 horizon)
Series control section - The zone from 0 to 77 inches.

Note:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed than most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are very low.  Typical totals of aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages are less than 0.20.  Tetilla soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.

Taxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S92NM-049-003.
