SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA
    Distribution: Coastal Plain of Delaware, and possibly Maryland and New Jersey.
    Extent: Small

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Morgantown, West Virginia

SERIES PROPOSED: New Castle County, Delaware, 1995.

REMARKS:
Tent soils were formerly included in the Elkton series.  They are distinguished from Elkton by having a dominantly silty substratum. Some pedons have an Ab and Oe horizon below 65 inches.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 13 inches
Argillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 28 inches
Aquic condition-the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously or periodically saturated
Series Control Section: 0 to 60 inches

ADDITIONAL DATA: The type location pedon was sampled as S93DE-003-010.  Additional reference samples are S92DE-003-017, S95DE-003-005, and S95DE-003-007.
