TIMBERISLAND SERIES

The Timberisland series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed tephra and colluvium and residuum from Lovejoy basalt.  Timberisland soils are on basalt benches, ridge tops and side slopes on ridges on volcanic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches, (2032 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, (11 degrees C).

Mudwash soils are very deep to a paralithic contact, medial over loamy, and are in depressional areas between lava flows.  Shakeridge are very deep to a lithic contact of basalt.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low to medium runoff; moderately rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, watershed and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is incense cedar, ponderosa pine, white fir, sugar pine, Pacific madrone, tanoak, Douglas-fir and California black oak with an understory of whitethorn ceanothus, greenleaf manzanita, western service berry, scrub oak, deerbrush, huckleberry oak, lupine, brackenfern, common snowberry and Sierra gooseberry.
