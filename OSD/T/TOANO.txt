TOANO SERIES

The Toano series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Toano soils are on alluvial flats, fan skirts, inset fans, lagoons, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

Other features:  Some pedons have stratified extremely gravelly sandy loam to extremely gravelly sand below 100 cm; some pedons have relict redoximorphic features in the lower C horizons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Garbutt, Penoyer, Smaug, and Yipor series.

Garbutt soils do not have horizons with secondary carbonates, have 3 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and have subhorizons within 100 cm that have 20 to 50 percent volcanic glass.  Penoyer soils do not have horizons with secondary carbonates, average less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, and are intermittently moist in some part for 10 to 20 days cumulative in summer months.  Smaug soils do not have horizons with secondary carbonates and formed in lacustrine deposits with platy structure.  Yipor soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C and average less than 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Toano soils are on alluvial flats, fan skirts, inset fans, lagoons, and stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ixian, Ocala, Sondoa, and Tulase soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils are usually not susceptible to flooding.  Some phases are susceptible to occasional flooding for very brief periods between February and May or rare flooding for very brief periods year-round.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Toano soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly sickle saltbush, bud sagebrush, and mustard. Areas that are subject to thin sheet flooding have mainly winterfat, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern and central Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage occurs in MLRA 28A.  Other acres of this series are mapped in MLRAs 25, 28A and 28B.
