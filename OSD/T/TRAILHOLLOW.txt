TRAILHOLLOW SERIES

The Trailhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Trailhollow soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Trailhollow loam, in rangeland on a 3 percent slope at about an elevation of 2,121 meters. (colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.) 

   A--0 to 15 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (10 to 20 cm thick)

   Bw--15 to 28 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine dendritic tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

   BCk1--28 to 107 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3), gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel; 10 percent fine and medium soft masses of calcium carbonate, 50 percent distinct continuous calcium carbonate coatings on coarse fragments, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2). (64 to 90 cm thick)

   BCk2--107 to 152 cm; brown (10YR 5/3), clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; very hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; 10 percent fine and medium soft masses of calcium carbonate, and finely disseminated calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
