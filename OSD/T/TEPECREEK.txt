TEPECREEK SERIES

The Tepecreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock. These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tepecreek very gravelly sandy clay loam, very bouldery, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; partially decomposed needles, twigs, and leaves. (1 to 8 cm thick) 

    A--3 to 8 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly sandy clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 35 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick) 

    E--8 to 23 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine and few medium pores; 40 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick) 

    Bt--23 to 48 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial and tubular pores; many faint clay films bridging sand grains; 40 percent pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 35 cm thick) 

    BC--48 to 91 cm; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) very gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and few fine interstitial and tubular pores; 55 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (28 to 70 cm thick) 

    Cr--91 to 134 cm; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 50 cm thick) 

    R--134 cm; hard granite bedrock.
