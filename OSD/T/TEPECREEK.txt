TEPECREEK SERIES 

The Tepecreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium or residuum derived from granite bedrock. These soils are on escarpments, ridges and sideslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

(11 to 28 inches thick) 

    Cr--34 to 52 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) decomposed granite bedrock (grus) that crushes to very gravelly loamy coarse sand; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 20 inches thick) 

    R--52 inches; hard granite bedrock.
