TAVERNIER SERIES

The Tavernier series consists of very poorly drained soils that are shallow to rippable coral limestone.  Tavernier soils formed in sapric organic material.  They are on tidal areas of the Florida Keys.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, isohyperthermic, shallow Lithic Haplosaprists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tavernier muck from a tidal area dominated by black mangroves and areas of rock outcrop.

     Oa--0 to 8 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) rubbed and unrubbed muck; about 20 percent unrubbed fiber content, less than 5 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky; about 30 percent by volume of fine and medium live roots; about 10 percent by volume of limestone fragments less than 3 inches in size; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary (3 to 16 inches thick).

     2R--8 inches; soft to hard, but rippable oolitic limestone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Monroe County, Florida; Key Largo; 1/4 mile east of Crocodile Lake and 150 feet south of State Road 905; SE 1/4, SE 1/4, Sec. 23, T. 59 S., R. 40 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is dominantly 3 to 16 inches, but ranges to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Percent by volume of coral or limestone gravel sized fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent.

     The Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 3.  Texture is muck or gravelly muck with a rubbed fiber content of less than 10 percent and an unrubbed fiber content of 15 to 50 percent.

     The 2R horizon is hard but rippable coral limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Competing series in similar families include the Islamorada and Keylargo series.  Islamorada and Keylargo soils are deeper to limestone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tavernier soils are on mangrove swamps subject to daily flooding by tides.  Elevations are less than 2 feet above 1929 NGVD.  The mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing organic Islamorada and Keylargo soils on similar landforms; the poorly drained marly Cudjoe, Lignumvitae, and Keywest soils on slightly higher elevations, and the moderately well drained organic Matecumbe and the somewhat poorly drained marly Saddlebunch soils on higher upland landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  These soils are very poorly drained with a high water table at or near the surface much of the year.  Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of the soil are used as wildlife habitat.  The dominate vegetation is red mangroves, black mangroves, and saltwort.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Approximately 1000 acres of Tavernier soils are on the Florida Keys.  These soils may occur on other tropical islands.
