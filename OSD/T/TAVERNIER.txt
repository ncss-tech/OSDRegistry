REMARKS:
These soils were formerly classified as shallow, Lithic Haplosaprists and are revised here to the twelfth edition of the keys (2014).
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this typical pedon:

1.	Histic epipedon - 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) (Oase horizon)
2.	Lithic (shallow) contact - 20 centimeters (8 inches) (2R horizon)
3.	Peraquic feature - the zone from 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches).
4.	Aquic conditions - endosaturation ranges from 0 to 203 centimeters (0 to 80 inches).
5.	Sulfidic feature - the zone from 0 to 20 centimeters (0 to 8 inches) contains sulfidic soil materials.
