TRIUMPH SERIES

The Triumph series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed with colluvium and residuum from granitic and metasedimentary rock on valley walls and ridges.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent on valley walls and 0 to 10 percent on ridges.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, isotic Vitrandic Humicryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Triumph gravelly ashy sandy loam, on a valley wall landform with a SW facing slope of 50 percent at 2000 meters elevation under herbaceous meadow vegetation.  When described on September 27, 2006 the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A1--0 to 15 cm; very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/2) gravelly ashy sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine and common very fine and medium roots throughout; 10 percent fine gravel, 10 percent medium and coarse gravel, and 5 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt wavy boundary.

 A2--15 to 50 cm; black (7.5YR 2.5/1) very cobbly ashy sandy loam, gray (7.5YR 5/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots throughout; 10 percent fine gravel, 20 percent medium and coarse gravel, and 25 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.

 A3--50 to 120 cm; black (7.5YR 2.5/1) extremely cobbly ashy sandy loam, gray (7.5YR 5/1) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine and medium roots throughout; 5 percent fine gravel, 15 percent medium and coarse gravel, and 60 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); diffuse wavy boundary.

 Cr--120 to 152 cm; weathered granite or metasedimentary rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Easy Ridge, North Cascades National Park, Whatcom County, Washington; 638 m west and 141 m north of SE corner of  Section 18, T39N, R11E Willamette Meridian; Mt. Blum, Washington USGS quadrangle; 48 degrees, 51 minutes, 40 seconds north latitude and 121 degrees, 25 minutes, 19 seconds west longitude; NAD83; UTM 615752 meters E, 5413201 meters N, zone 10. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature:  4 to 8 degrees C.  Cryic soil temperature regime.
Soil moisture control section:  dry for less than 30 consecutive days from June to October.  Udic soil moisture regime.
Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock: 100 to 150 centimeters
Thickness of Vitrandic feature: 40 to 75 centimeters 
Thickness of umbric epipedon: 60 to 120 centimeters

A horizons:
Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value - 2 to 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry
Chroma - 1 to 3 moist or dry
Fine earth texture - ashy FSL or ashy SL 
Rock fragments - 15 to 85 percent total (typically increases with depth)
                 10 to 50 percent gravel
                  5 to 60 percent cobbles
                  0 to 5 percent stones
Clay content - 3 to 10 percent
Volcanic glass - 0 to 15 percent 
Reaction - extremely acid to strongly acid
Thickness - 60 to 120 centimeters

Bw horizons are sometimes present with thickness ranging up to 40 centimeters, textures of FSL, SL or LS, reaction of strongly acid or moderately acid, hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist value of 2 to 4, and moist chroma of  3 to 5.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Potrmound, Prong, and Rhylow series.  Prong and Potrmound soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Rhylow soils are very deep and have an umbric epipedon 25 to 50 centimeters thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Triumph soils are on valley walls and ridges at elevations of 1,200 to 2,200 meters.  These soils are found on the ridge-shoulder-steep valley wall continuum with slopes ranging from 0 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed with residuum and colluvium from granitic and metasedimentary rock.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C.  Frost free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Harlequin, Stetattle, and Treen (T) series.  Harlequin soils are shallow to bedrock and are found on valley walls with slopes steeper than 65 percent.  Stetattle soils have andic soil properties, and are also found on active, herbaceous portions of valley walls.  Treen soils are shallow to bedrock, have andic soil properties, and are found on ridges that have preserved volcanic ash deposits.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained, high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for watershed, recreation, woodland and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation consists of herbaceous and coniferous mosaics.  Herbaceous vegetation consists of heather, lupine, sedges, huckleberry, false hellebore, cow parsnip, and foam flower.  Coniferous islands of mountain hemlock, Pacific silver fir, subalpine fir, and subalpine larch may be present.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Western slopes of the North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
