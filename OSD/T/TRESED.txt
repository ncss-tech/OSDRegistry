TRESED SERIES

The Tresed series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Tresed soils are on lake plains and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Clayey over loamy, smectitic over mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tresed loamy very fine sand--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(8 to 15 cm thick)

    C1--15 to 25 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very fine sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium prismatic and strong very thin and thin platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and common fine roots along prism faces; common very fine tubular pores; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) organic stains; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.2); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 10 cm thick)

    2C2--25 to 64 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silty clay, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; weak very fine and fine prismatic structure parting to moderate very fine through medium angular blocky; hard, friable, very sticky and very plastic; many very fine and common fine roots along prism faces; few very fine tubular pores; brown (10YR 5/3) organic stains; many faint pressure cutans on faces of peds; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (23 to 48 cm thick)

    3C3--64 to 99 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) stratified very fine sandy loam and silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; soft to slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; many fine distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) relict masses of iron accumulation; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 36 cm thick)

    3Cky--99 to 130 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; common fine filaments and threads of gypsum and carbonates; carbonate coats on some sand grains; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 79 cm thick)

    3C'--130 to 157 cm; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tresed soils are on lake plains and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 3,900 to 4,400 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Essal and Isolde series.   Essal soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Isolde soils are sandy throughout.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tresed soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, seepweed, and spiny horsebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 24, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 27.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Davis, California.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Humboldt County, Nevada (East Part), 1993.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of the C1 horizons).
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 99 to 130 cm (3Cky horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 25 and 100 cm (2C2 and 3C3 and part of the 3Cky horizon).

The revision of April 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Clayey over loamy, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents.
