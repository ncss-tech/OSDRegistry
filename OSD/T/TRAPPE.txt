COMPETING SERIES:
Demas soils--do not have layers with chroma of 3 or more and are associated with storm surge washover fan flats and slopes in coastal lagoons, at deeper water depths.
Mantoloking soils--do not have underlying layers with chroma of 3 or more, formed from barrier island overwash sediments, at slightly shallower water depths

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Estuaries
Landform: Shallow mainland coves
Parent Material: Heterogeneous estuarine sediments underlain by pre-Holocene sandy upland deposits
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Bathymetry: 1.0 to 4.5 feet (0.3 to 1.4 meters) below mean sea level 
Water Regime: Tidal, 1.0 to 2.0 feet (0.3 to 0.6 meters) tidal range

Southpoint soils--have a buried histic epipedon within 40 inches of the surface; at deeper water depths
Transquaking soils--have surface organic layers more than 51 inches thick and are not permanently submersed; on adjacent tidal marshes
Mispillion soils--have surface organic layers 16 to 51 inches thick and are not permanently submersed; on adjacent tidal marshes
Purnell soils--have surface organic layers 8 to 15 inches thick and are not permanently submersed; on adjacent tidal marshes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Agricultural Drainage Class: Subaqueous (permanently submersed)
Permeability: Moderate to very rapid
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high to very high

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Most areas are vegetated and function as estuarine benthic wildlife habitat.  Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish are common.
Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima).  Vegetative cover ranges from 25 to 100 percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and possibly Virginia. This series is of small extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Worcester County, Maryland, 1917.

REMARKS: Trappe soils were formerly included with areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support submersed aquatic vegetation. These soils would classify in the proposed Subaquic subgroup. The initial name proposed for this series was Newport. It was revised to Queponca and later changed to Trappe.

Refer to Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland; G.P. Demas, J.H. Brown, and M.C. Rabenhorst; July 1998.  Possible groundwater intrusion occurs at a depth of 15 to 60 inches.  (38 to 152 centimeters)

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon (oxidized)--the zone from 0 to 2 inches (0 to 5 centimeters) (A horizon)
Peraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 60 inches (0 to 150 centimeters) is permanently saturated
