COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lignumvitae (FL)series, and Perrine (FL) series. Closely related soil is Pennsuco (FL) series.
Lignumvitae soils have limestone bedrock at depths less than 100 centimeters (40 inches), are subjected to flooding by tides, storm surges, and hurricanes, and occur in low broad tidal flats.
Pennsuco soils are Hyperthermic, is not in the tidal zone, are not very frequently flooded and occur on slightly higher landform positions.
Perrine soils have bedrock at depths less than 100 centimeters (40 inches), do not occur in the tidal zone, are not very frequently flooded, and occur on slightly higher landform positions.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landscape: Lower Coastal Plain
Landform(s): tidal marshes, swamps, and low broad coastal flats

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
Dade soils have a sandy particle-sized control section, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, have bedrock at depths less than 100 centimeters (40 inches), are better drained, and occur on slightly higher landform positions.  
Perrine soils have bedrock at depths less than 100 centimeters (40 inches), do not occur in the tidal zone, are not very frequently flooded, and are on similar landform positions.
Hallandale soils have limestone bedrock at depths less than 51 centimeters (20 inches), lack argillic horizons, and occur on similar landform positions.
Margate soils have mollic epipedons, lack argillic horizons, and occur on similar landform positions.
Lostmans soils have limestone bedrock at depths less than 51 centimeters (20 inches), lack argillic horizons, contain calcium carbonates, and occur on similar landform positions. 
Goddens Strand soils have mollic epipedon at depths less than 81 centimeters (32 inches), have argillic horizon at depth of 81 to 137 centimeters (32 to 54 inches), and are on similar landform positions.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:

Saturated hydraulic conductivity (KSAT): Moderately high to high

Depth to seasonal high water table: 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 6 inches) of the surface.
Surface Water: can range from 15 to 122 centimeters (6 to 48 inches) during the raining season (June to November). During the months of December and January surface water can range from 15 to 91 centimeters (6 to 36 inches).  During the dry season February to May surface water ranges from 15 to 76 centimeters (6 to 30 inches). 
Flooding, tidal: surface water ranges from 0 to 122 centimeters (0 to 48 inches).  
Hydric Indicators: F10 Marl

USE AND VEGETATION:  
Major uses: wildlife habitat, water storage, and water quality.
Dominant vegetation: Forested areas may include but are not limited to red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) and button mangrove (Conocarpus erectus). Non-Forested areas may include but are not limited to various species of cordgrass (Spartina spp.), needlegrass rush (Juncus roemerianus), salt grass (Distichlis spicata), Jamaica swamp sawgrass (Cladium mariscus ssp. Jamaicense), and various flowering forbs. Scattered stunted mangrove species (mentioned above) may be present in non-forested communities. Changes in salinity (ppt) is often the main driver between different major zones of vegetative species in both forested and non-forested areas.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Everglades and Associated Areas (MLRA 156A)
