TROUGHSPRING SERIES

The Troughspring series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Troughspring soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Petrocalcic Paleustolls

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Troughspring soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 4 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Elevations are 7,000 to 8,700 feet. The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and common summer convection storms.Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the frost free season is 90 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Charkiln, Doespring and Buckspring soils. The Charkiln soils have an argillic horizon with a base below below 40 inches and do not have a petrocalcic horizon. Doespring soils do not have an argillic horizon. Buckspring soils are shallow over limestone bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high or medium runoff; slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for forest and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is mainly singleleaf pinyon, curlleaf mountain mahogany, yellowleaf silktassle, Utah serviceberry and Gambles oak. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada; MLRA 30.  These soils are of small extent.
