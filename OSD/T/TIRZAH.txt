MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina

SERIES PROPOSED: Montgomery County, North Carolina, 2007

REMARKS: Tirzah soils were previously mapped in the Carolina Slate Belt of North Carolina, South Carolina, and possibly Georgia during the 1950s and 1960s. The series was made inactive due to overlapping soil properties with competing series. Since the early 1970s, Tirzah soils have been mapped with Georgeville, Mecklenburg, Cullen, Hiwassee, Coronaca, Davidson, Uwharrie, and less commonly Lloyd soils. Taxonomic division of clayey Ultisols into fine or very-fine families allows for the reactivation of the series. It is confined to residual materials derived from rocks associated with the Carolina Slate Belt geologic 
formations.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon--the zone between 0 and 10 centimeters (about 0 to 4 inches) (A horizon)
Kandic horizon--the zone from 10 to 135 centimeters (about 4 to 53 inches) (Bt horizons 
Argillic horizon--the zone between 10 and 135 centimeters (about 4 to 53 inches) (Bt horizons)
Series control--section: 0 to 200 centimeters (about 0 to 79 inches)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Laboratory Data: Reference data are available from the NRCS-Soil Survey 
Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; sampled as the Cullen Series, Sample 
Number=95P5897 and 95P5898).
