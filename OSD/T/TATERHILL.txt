TATERHILL SERIES

The Taterhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands. They formed in slope alluvium derived mainly from loess and the underlying valley fill materials. These soils are on gently to moderately sloping foot slopes and high strath terraces in MLRA 116A. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Typic Paleudults

TYPICAL PEDON: Taterhill silt loam on a 2 percent slope in a tall fescue and red clover pasture at an elevation of 960 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated)

	BA--11 to 15 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores and common medium tubular pores filled with brown (10YR 4/3) worm casts; 1 percent subangular chert gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 10 inches thick)

	Bt1--15 to 20 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots throughout; common medium tubular pores; few distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 2 percent subangular chert gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear smooth boundary.

	Bt2--20 to 28 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots throughout; common medium tubular pores; few distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay films on faces of peds; few prominent black (N 2/0) iron-manganese stains throughout; 10 percent subangular chert gravel and 2 percent subangular chert cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 8 to 36 inches)

	2Bt3--28 to 36 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots throughout; common medium tubular pores; few prominent red (2.5YR 4/6) clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent subangular chert gravel and 2 percent subangular chert cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual wavy boundary.

	2Bt4--36 to 48 inches; 50 percent red (2.5YR 4/6) and 50 percent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium tubular pores; common distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) clay films in root channels and pores; many prominent light brown (7.5YR 6/3) silt coats in root channels and pores; 20 percent subangular chert gravel and 5 percent subangular chert cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); gradual wavy boundary.

	2Bt5--48 to 80 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) silty clay loam; strong fine angular blocky structure; firm; common medium vesicular pores; common distinct red (2.5YR 4/6) clay films in root channels and pores; common prominent pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) silt coats in root channels and pores; 10 percent subangular chert gravel and 2 percent subangular chert cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 4.8). (Combined thickness of the 2Bt horizons is 32 to 40 inches or more)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cottonbend, Egyptgrove, Fanchon, McClung, Nolichucky, Trimble, and Wyrick series. Cottonbend, McClung, and Trimble soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Egyptgrove soils have a Btd horizon. Fanchon soils have a 3Bt horizon. Nolichucky soils have rounded sandstone and quartzite fragments. Wyrick soils typically have fewer rock fragments in the 2Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Taterhill soils are typically on foot slopes and occasionally on high strath terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium derived mainly from loess and the underlying valley fill materials. Elevations are commonly 850 to 1,150 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedargap, Poynor, Scholten and Tonti soils. Cedargap soils are loamy-skeletal and on flood plains. Poynor soils have a loamy-skeletal over clayey particle-size class and are on side slopes. Scholten and Tonti soils have fragipans. Scholten soils are on side slopes and have a loamy-skeletal particle size class. Tonti soils are on ridge tops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Runoff is low to medium. Permeability is moderate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for pasture and hayland. A few areas are used for cultivated crops. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Ozarks Highland region (MLRA 116A) of southern Missouri and possibly northern Arkansas. This series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 inches (Ap and BA horizons).Argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 80 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons).This soil is being mapped predominantly in the Jefferson City and Roubidoux formations (Ordivician age) in Missouri.
