THREEBEAR SERIES

The Threebear series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. They are mountain slopes, structural benches, and hills on plateaus. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low and slopes range from 3 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 36 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Threebear soils are on mountain slopes, structural benches, and hills on plateaus at elevations of 1,600 to 4,000 feet 488 to 1220 meters) with slopes of 3 to 40 percent. These soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. The average annual temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches (635 to 1270 mm). The frost free season is 50 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dworshak, Elkridge, Norwidge and Riswold soils. Dworshak soils are on mountains and hills and lack a fragipan. Elkridge and Riswold soils are on hills and canyons and lack a fragipan. Norwidge soils are on hills and lack a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; medium runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity. A perched water table is present. Typically it occurs at a depth of 19 to 40 inches from December through May but can occur at a depth of 4 to 40 inches from November through July.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is western hemlock, western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, and western white pine with an understory of queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, oneleaf foam flower, goldthread, starry false Solomons-seal, myrtle pachystima, common snowberry and Columbia brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho; Threebear soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 43A.

Particle size control section - The zone from 1 to 41 inches (A, Bw1, Bw2, 2E/Bt, 2Bt/E1, 2Bt/E2, and portions of the 2Btxb1 horizons)

Classification change on 1/2010 from Alfic to Oxyaquic Udivitrands based on the seasonally perched water table and criteria in the Tenth Edition of Soil Taxonomy.

The ranges of values listed under the Range in Characteristics for the soil properties Volcanic glass content, Acid-oxalate Al +1/2 Fe, Phosphate retention and 15-bar water retention are estimates only.
