TROUTDALE SERIES

The Troutdale series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed material weathered from schist, gneiss, and interbedded granitic rocks.  Troutdale soils are on mountain slopes and ridge crests, and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, micaceous Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Troutdale sandy loam - grassland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 to 10 percent rock fragments; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    BA--4 to 8 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few faint clay films on the faces of peds; 5 to 10 percent rock fragments; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bt1--8 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic about 5 to 10 percent rock fragments, common sand size mica flakes; common prominent clay films on faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt2--14 to 18 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; about 10 to 15 percent rock fragments; common  sand size mica flakes; few distinct clay films on the faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    BCt--18 to 29 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) coarse sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; about 10 percent rock fragments; common to many sand size mica flakes with the greater percentage in the lower part of horizon; very few faint clay films on the faces of peds; neutral; clear wavy boundary.   (0 to 15 inches thick)

    Cr--29 inches; weathered micaceous schist.

TYPE LOCATION:  Jefferson County, Colorado; approximately 1/2 mile south, 1 1/2 miles west of Bergen Park; 150 feet west, 320 feet south of the NE corner of the SE1/4 of Sec. 24, R. 72 W., T. 4 S.; Lat. 39 degrees, 41 minutes, 12 seconds N., and long. 105 degrees, 23 minutes, 12 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture:  The soil moisture control section is ustic moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  43 to 47 degrees F
Mean summer soil temperature:  45 to 50 degrees F
Depth to paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches
Reaction:  slightly acid through slightly alkaline
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  7 to 16 inches

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent (dominated with gravel)
Mica flakes of sand size range from common to many throughout the Bt and BC horizons

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR through 2.5Y
Value:  3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma:  2 or 3

Bt horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR through 2.5Y
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4
Texture:  sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam
Rock fragments:  5 to 15 percent (dominated with gravel)
Clay content:  18 to 35 percent

C horizon (if present):
Hue:  7.5YR through 2.5Y

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Kittredge (CO) series.
Kittredge soils are very deep.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  schist, gneiss, and interbedded granitic rock or in alluvium derived from these rocks
Landform:  mountain slopes and ridge crests.  
Slopes:  2 to 50 percent
Elevation:  7,200 to 9,600 feet
Mean annual temperature:  41 to 45 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  14 to 22 inches
Precipitation pattern:  wettest months:  March, April, May, June; driest months:  September and October
Frost-free period:  less than 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lucky and Kittredge soils.  Lucky soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing and hayland.  Native vegetation is mainly Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Parry oatgrass, and some forbs and shrubs.  In some places there are scattered pines where areas of this soil borders woodland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous area of north-central and central Colorado.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Custer County, Colorado, 1979.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic features include mollic colors from 0 to 14 inches; an argillic horizon from 8 to 18 inches; and a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. 

The mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.
