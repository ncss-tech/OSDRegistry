TWICK SERIES

The Twick series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in fine textured alluvium and residuum derived from shale.  Twick soils are on upland hilly terrain and have slopes of 5 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Twick cobbly silty clay loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 1 inch; brown (7.5YR 4/2) cobbly silty clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 25 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.); abrupt smooth boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--1 to 4 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine and medium pores; thin patchy clay films; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    B2t--4 to 17 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine pores; thin continuous clay films; slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (7 to 13 inches thick)

    Cr--17 inches; soft calcareous shale with a few beds of sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  San Juan County, New Mexico; 5.7 miles north of the junction of county road 18 and New Mexico Highway 544, on New Mexico 544 then 1.1 miles NW on road to section T.32N., R.8W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.+

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Twick soils are on upland hills and breaks.  Slope gradient ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  They formed in alluvium and fine textured residuum from shale.  Elevation ranges from about 6,400 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F. and the frost free season is about 120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buckle, Penistaja, and Travessilla soils.  Penistaja and Buckle soils lack bedrock within depth of 20 inches and are fine, loamy.  Travessilla soils have a lithic contact, are loamy and lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Rangeland.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Present vegetation is pinyon pine, oneseed juniper, antelope bitterbrush, serviceberry, sideoats grama, and mountain mahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Uplands in northwestern New Mexico, possibly extending into Colorado.  Series is of small extent. MLRAs 35 & 36.
