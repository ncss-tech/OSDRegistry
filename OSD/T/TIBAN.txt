TIBAN SERIES

The Tiban series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, till or slide deposits derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on escarpments, mountain slopes, hills, ridges, alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan remnants and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tiban stony clay loam, grassland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(3 to 12 inches thick)

    Bw--4 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; 35 percent gravel and cobbles; many clear silt and fine sand grains; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. (7 to 21 inches thick)

    Bk--13 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; brown (10YR 4/3) moist coatings; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots (roots matted around rocks); few very fine pores; 45 percent gravel; common distinct calcium carbonate coatings with incrustation on undersides of gravel, and common fine masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 40 inches thick)

    C--23 to 60 inches; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) very gravelly clay loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine pores; 50 percent angular gravel, cobbles and stones of limestone, quartzite, and sandstone; calcium carbonate coats on the underside of rock fragments; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Babb, Duncom, and Tarrete soils. Babb soils are fine-loamy and have a calcic horizon. Duncom soils are shallow to a lithic contact, are loamy, and have a calcic horizon. Tarrete soils are very fine and formed in material from red shale. These soils are on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tiban soils are used mainly for native grass range for summer grazing.  Potential native vegetation is mainly short and mid grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tiban soils are of moderate extent in the southern mountain areas of Montana. MLRAs - 43B, 44B, 46.
