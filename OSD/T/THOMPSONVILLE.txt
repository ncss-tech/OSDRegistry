THOMPSONVILLE SERIES

The Thompsonville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits over stratified silty and loamy materials. These soils are on outwash terraces, outwash plains and glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Alfic Oxyaquic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Thompsonville fine sand, on an east-facing, linear, 1 percent slope in a wooded area at an elevation of about 244 meters (800 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 2B/E--140 to 183 cm (55 to 72 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) silty clay loam (Bt) surrounding pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) silty clay loam (E), light gray (7.5YR 7/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common very fine and fine roots; few faint brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay films on faces of peds; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

 2C--183 to 203 cm (72 to 80 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) stratified very fine sandy loam and silty clay loam; massive; friable; many coarse prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron in the matrix; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; slightly acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thompsonville soils are on outwash terraces, outwash plains, and glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits and the underlying loamy materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 8.9 degrees C (46 to 48 degrees F). Frost-free period is 110 to 120 days. Elevation is 183 to 366 meters (600 to 1,200 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Pipestone, Covert, Milnichol, Dair, Kaleva, and Grattan soils. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Dair soils, the somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils, the moderately well drained Covert soils, and the excessively drained Kaleva and Grattan soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the soil is sandy throughout. The somewhat poorly drained Milnichol soils form a drainage sequence with Thompsonville soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 102 cm (18 to 40 inches) for 30 or more days between October and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material and moderately low in the loamy material. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and slow in the loamy material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in woodland. Mature forests are mostly red maple, northern red oak, paper birch, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and red pine. Balsam fir and quaking aspen are in most stands. Some areas are used for cropland and pastureland. Corn, small grains, and hay are the principal crops. Some areas formerly used as cropland are now idle or planted to pine trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 96 and 98 in northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
