THOMASFORK SERIES

The Thomasfork series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on low stream terraces and flood plains. They formed in fine textured alluvium. Permeability is slow. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Fluvaquentic Vertic Endoaquolls

COMPETING SERIES: 
Mountmed (CA) - mollic epipedon is less than 21 inches thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thomasfork soils are on low stream terraces and flood plains. They have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. They formed in fine textured alluvium. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 70 to 90 days. Elevations are 5,800 to 6,400 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the  Bear Lake,  Bern (T) and  Raynal (T) series. Bear Lake soils are poorly drained, have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and have fine-silty particle-size control sections. Bern soils are moderately well drained and have fine-silty particle-size control sections. Raynal soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section. Bear Lake soils are on floodplains on positions below Thomasfork soils. Bern soils are on stream terraces above Thomasfork soils. Raynal soils are on similar positions to Thomasfork soils but are located to the sides of Thomasfork.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; slow permeability; occasional or rare flooding for brief periods December through May.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used mainly for small grains and hayland.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: This soil is of small extent in southeastern Idaho.  MLRA 13.
