TUTTLE SERIES

The Tuttle series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in colluvium deposited over residuum from calcareous shales and limestone.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tuttle channery silty clay loam, stony - in woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   A--0 to 15 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) channery silty clay loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine and medium roots; few chert fragments less than 2 inches in diameter, 20 percent by volume limestone fragments, 1/4 inch to 24 inches in length; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 18 inches thick)

   Bw1--15 to 24 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) channery silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine and medium roots; 25 percent by volume limestone fragments, 1/4 inch to 24 inches in length; few gravel size fragments; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.  (7 to 20 inches thick)

   2Bw2--24 to 36 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) channery silty clay loam, dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; many fine roots; 20 percent by volume limestone fragments, 1/4 inch to 15 inches length; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

   2Bw3--36 to 46 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) silty clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; common fine roots; 10 percent by volume limestone fragments, 1/4 inch to 15 inches in length; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of 2Bw ranges from 10 to 24 inches.)

   CR--46 to 60 inches; soft, white, moderately alkaline, calcareous silty shales.

TYPE LOCATION:  Pottawatomie County, Kansas; about 5 miles south and 2 1/2 miles west of Olsburg; 1,500 feet north and 400 feet east of the southwest corner, sec. 16, T. 8 S., R. 7 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to shale range from 40 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 27 inches thick.  This soil generally contains free carbonates to the surface.
The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (dry or moist), and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is channery silty clay loam but includes silty clay loam, clay loam, and channery clay loam.  This horizon is dominately moderately alkaline, but some pedons are mildly alkaline or neutral.  Limestone fragments less than 6 inches in length range from 0 to 30 percent by volume.  Coarse limestone fragments greater than 6 inches in length range from 5 to 30 percent by volume.

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is channery silty clay loam but includes silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, channery silty clay and channery clay loam.  Limestone fragments less than 6 inches in length range from 0 to 40 percent by volume.  Coarse limestone fragments greater than 6 inches in length range from 0 to 35 percent by volume.

The 2Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is channery silty clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay and channery silty clay.  Shale and weathered limestone fragments range from 0 to 30 percent by volume.  Some pedons have mottles.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Bagley in the same family.  Bagley soils do not have coarse fragment in the control section and are on flood plains.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tuttle soils are on uplands.  The slope gradients range from 20 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous colluvium deposited over residuum from calcareous shales and limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches.  Thornwaites Annual PE Index ranges from 48 to 60.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Benfield, Clime, Florence, Sogn, and Tully soils.  The Benfield and Florence soils are higher on the landscape and have an argillic horizons.  The Clime soils are moderately deep over shale and occur on similar landscapes.  Sogn soils are shallow and are on less sloping areas.  Tully soils are below Tuttle soils on foot slopes and have an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained.  Runoff is rapid to very rapid.  Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  All areas are used as woodland and rangeland.  Native vegetation is woodland.  Dominate trees are blackjack oak, chinquapin oak, bur oak, slippery elm, hackberry, and redbud.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Largely confined to the steep slopes along major drains in the Flint Hills in east central Kansas.  The series is of small extent, about 10,000 acres.
