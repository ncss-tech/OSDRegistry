THAINCREEK SERIES  

The Thaincreek series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils occur on stream terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Thaincreek sandy loam, mixed grassland and shrubland on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 1360 meters (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

 A1--0 to 14 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine and fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. 

 A2--14 to 28 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very cobbly loamy sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; 25 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A horizons is 25 to 60 cm) 

 BC--28 to 64 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) extremely cobbly sand, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to single grain; loose; many very fine and fine roots, common medium and coarse roots; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 50 cm thick)

 C--64 to 150 cm; variegated extremely cobbly sand; single grain; loose; few very fine and fine roots; 30 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4). (80 to 130 cm thick)

USE AND VEGETATION: Thaincreek soils are used mainly for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  The vegetation is mainly grasses, forbs, and shrubs with a few scattered trees; species include: Timothy, Poa sp., Bromus sp., Carex sp., Columbia needlegrass, snowberry (common & wetsren), mountain big sagebrush, serviceberry, wild rose, Oregon grape, Potentilla sp., Erigeron sp., sticky geranium, yarrow, bergamot, Douglas-fir, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and lodgepole pine; as well as other miscellaneous grasses and forbs.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Thaincreek soils are of limited extent in central Montana.  MLRA 43B.
