TIGLEY SERIES

The Tigley series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foothills, dissected terraces, escarpments, and breaklands. They formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary rock, with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Slopes are 15 to 80 percent. Permeability is moderately slow. The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 34 inches.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Beaverdump series. 

Beaverdump soils: have 2Bt/E horizons and formed in alluvium and glacial outwash.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tigley soils are on south-facing foothills, dissected terraces, escarpments, and breaklands. Slopes range from 15 to 80 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and old alluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary rock, with a mantle of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevation ranges from 2,160 to 4,200 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches. The average frost-free period is from 80 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ahrs, Hugus, Lotuspoint, and Pinecreek soils. Ahrs soils are on east and west-facing adjacent mountain slopes and do not have an argillic horizon. Hugus soils are on north-facing foothills and terrace slopes, and have a thick volcanic ash mantle. Lotuspoint soils are on south-facing canyonsides and ridges, and have hard bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and are mesic. Pinecreek soils are on south-facing adjacent mountain slopes and do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine, ponderosa pine, and western larch with an understory of queencup beadlily, goldthread, longtube twinflower, starry false-Solomons-seal, American trailplant, myrtle pachystima, creambush oceanspray, common snowberry, baldhip rose, pine reedgrass, and Columbia brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho; MLRA 43A. This soil is moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: St. Joe Area, Shoshone County Idaho, 1993.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 4 inches (Oi, Oe, and A horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons)
Volcanic ash influence - the zone from 1 to 11 inches (A and BA horizons)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 31 inches (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)

Parent material of the Tigley series mapped in West Benewah County is metasedimentary colluvium. The tertiary alluvium and colluvium parent materials are mapped in East Benewah and Shoshone Counties.
