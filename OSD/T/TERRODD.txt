TERRODD SERIES  

The Terrodd series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low terraces of mountain valley floors.  Terrodd soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Cumulic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Terrodd silt loam - under conifer forest, on 0 percent slope at elevation of 3,360 feet. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Soil textures are apparent field textures.)

  A1--0 to 11 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; weak medium and fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and few coarse roots throughout; few fine and medium tubular, and few very fine irregular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. 

  A2--11 to 24 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) silt loam, brown (7.5YR 5/2) dry; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, medium and few coarse roots throughout; few very fine tubular and irregular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of A horizons is 20 to 30 inches)

  2Bw--24 to 43 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) very stony sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) dry; common medium prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) redox concentrations, few medium faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) redox depletions; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots throughout; few very fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); gradual smooth boundary.  (6 to 30 inches thick)

  2C--43 to 61 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) extremely stony loamy sand, brown (7.5YR 5/3) dry; many fine prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) redox concentrations; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine irregular pores; 35 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles, and 20 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).
