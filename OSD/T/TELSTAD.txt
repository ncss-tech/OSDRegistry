SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Valley County, Montana, 1976. 

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0233, MT1174.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - from 7 to 14 inches that is also the particle-size control section (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation - from 14 to 45 inches (Btk, Bk1, Bk2 horizons); till from 32 to 60 inches (Bk2, BC horizons).  Telstad soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
