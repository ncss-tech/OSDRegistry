TUMTUM SERIES

The Tumtum series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Tumtum soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, fan piedmonts, and terraces. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Argidurids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tumtum cobbly loam on a 7 percent slope--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) cobbly loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 15 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 15 cm thick)

    Bt--5 to 30 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; common faint clay films on peds; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt wavy boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

    Bkqm--30 to 64 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) indurated duripan, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; massive, thick plates; slightly effervescent; 10 percent gravel; clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 46 cm thick)

    2Ck--64 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent-disseminated lime; 30 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Harney County, Oregon; north side of road about 0.5 mile northwest of Antelope Well in the NE1/4 SW1/4 section 11, T. 40 S., R.  36 E.; latitude  42 degrees  6 minutes  42 seconds N and longitude 118 degrees  27 minutes 36 seconds W; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry, intermittently moist in winter and spring; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 9 degrees C.  
Depth to an indurated duripan: 23 to 46 cm.  

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 25 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: Average 5 to 15 percent and are dominantly gravel.  

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3 moist and dry.  
Organic matter: 0.3 to 0.5 percent.

Bt horizon 
Value: 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  
Texture: Clay loam. 
Clay content: 27 to 35 percent.

2Ck horizon Texture: 
Gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam. 
Clay content: 5 to 15 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cleaver, Corder, Laped, Shoofly, Silent and Spanel series.  

Cleaver and Shoofly soils have a mean annual soil temperature of greater than 11 degrees C. Corder and Laped soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 75 cm.  Silent soils are calcareous throughout the profile.  Spanel soils are moist for 10 to 20 days from July through September.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tumtum soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, fan piedmonts and terraces at elevations of 1,030 to 1,545 meters. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The Tumtum soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Defenbaugh, Deppy, Kerrfield, and Outerkirk soils.  Defenbaugh and Outerkirk soils are deep.  Deppy soils have a strongly cemented duripan. Kerrfield soils lack an argillic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for livestock grazing.  Vegetation commonly is Wyoming big sagebrush, spiny hopsage, Thurber needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central Oregon and Northwestern Nevada; MLRA 24.  The series is of moderate extent.
