TERCIO SERIES

The Tercio series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale and siltstone.  Tercio soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Ustic Glossocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Tercio cobbly loam, on a north facing, convex, 28 percent slope in forest at an elevation of 8880 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on July 10, 1985 the soil was moist from 0 to 38 inches.

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; partially decomposed moss, needles and twigs.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

    E--2 to 10 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.3); clear smooth boundary. (6 to 10 inches thick)

    E/B--10 to 16 inches; 60 percent very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist and 40 percent light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; 15 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--16 to 30 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong coarse blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; many thin clay films on faces of peds; 15 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); gradual smooth boundary.

    Bt2--30 to 38 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) cobbly clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) relict redox concentrations on ped faces; strong medium blocky structure; extremely hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; common thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; 10 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined Bt1 and Bt2 thickness is 20 to 40 inches)

    BC--38 to 70 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) cobbly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; many fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) relict redox concentrations on ped faces; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; 20 percent cobbles, 15 percent shale parafragments; strongly acid (pH 5.2).

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 30 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Albic horizon:  The zone from 2 to 10 inches.  (E horizon)
Glossic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 16 inches.  (E/B horizon)
Argillic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 38 inches.  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations are relict and do not reflect the current drainage class of this soil. 

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
