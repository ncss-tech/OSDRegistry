SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Black Hawk County, Iowa, 1917

REMARKS:
Particle size control section--the zone from a depth of 46 to 96 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, BA, Bt1, Bt2, and BC horizons).

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 46 centimeters (Ap, A1, A2, and BA horizons);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 46 to 114 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

The thickness of the A horizon, depth to sub-horizon highest in clay, maximum percent clay, thickness of Bt horizon, depth to carbonates, and depth to redoximorphic features usually decrease as gradient increases on convex slopes.
