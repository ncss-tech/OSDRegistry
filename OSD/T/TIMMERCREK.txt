TIMMERCREK SERIES

The Timmercrek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till dominantly from quartzite, with local admixtures of shale or argillite. The Timmercrek soils are on moraines. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Xeric Haplocryolls

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Timmercrek soils are on moraines. These soils formed in glacial till dominantly from quartzite, with local admixture from shale or argillite. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,840 to 3,430 meters. The climate is humid with cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, most of which falls as snow. The mean annual temperature is 1.5 to 4 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 30 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Jumble series. Jumble soils have an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is mainly quaking aspen, Engelmann spruce, and limber pine. This site is correlated to Ecological Site F28AY078NV Quaking aspen-Engelmann's spruce-mountain snowberry, mountain brome and slender wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East Central Nevada. MLRA 28A. These soils are not extensive.
