TETON SERIES

The Teton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium from sandstone.  These soils are on hills and mountains  Slopes are 2 to 65  percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Teton loam, cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 7 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots; less than 5 percent angular sandstone pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 7 inches thick)

    Bw1--7 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to strong medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; less than 5 percent angular sandstone pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 20 inches thick)

    Bw2--15 to 32 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 10 percent angular sandstone pebbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 18 inches thick)

    R--32 inches; hard sandstone bedrock with fractures.

Mean annual precipitation - 19 to 30 inches.
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 50 to 70 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Teton soils are used mainly for rangeland, cropland, and pastureland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bearded wheatgrass, rough fescue, needlegrasses, Idaho fescue, mountain brome, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Teton soils are of moderate extent in central and southern Montana and Utah.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Records:  MT8058, MT8076, and MT0693.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 15 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 15 to 32 inches (Bw2 horizon); a lithic contact at 32 inches (R horizon); a particle size control section from 10 to 32 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons). Teton soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
