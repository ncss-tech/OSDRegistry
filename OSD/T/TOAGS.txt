TOAGS SERIES

The Toags series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous rocks. The Toags soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (432 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F (16 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Mixed, thermic Typic Xeropsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Toags gravelly coarse sand under a canopy of buckwheat, and annual grasses and forbs on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 1,060 feet (324 meters). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A1--0 to 7 inches (0 to 18 centimeters); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly coarse sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.

	A2--7 to 24 inches (18 to 61 centimeters); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly coarse sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure, and weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear wavy boundary.

	C1--24 to 42 inches (61 to 107 centimeters); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

	C2--42 to 60 (107 to 152 centimeters); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly coarse sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; single grain; loose, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7).

TYPE LOCATION: San Benito County, California; about 230 feet (70 meters) southwest of Highway 146 and the fire lane that leads to the South Wilderness Trail; 1,400 feet west and 2,600 feet south of the northeast corner of section 1, T 17S, R 7E; USGS North Chalone Peak, California topographic quadrangle; 36 degrees 28 minutes 51.60 seconds north latitude and 121 degrees 9 minutes 26.90 seconds west longitude; UTM 665051 meters E, 4088870 meters N, zone 10.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Arnold, Briones, Corralitos, Monoridge, Monvero, Pismo, Tujunga, and Abaft. Arnold soils are deep and Briones soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, Pismo soils are shallow to a paralithic contact, Corralitos has less than 15 percent rock fragments, Monoridge has secondary gypsum, Monvero is effervescent throughout, the Tujunga and Abaft soils are in a 15 to 25 inch (380 to 635 millimeter) precipitation zone in MLRA 20.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toags soils are on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Elevation ranges from 980 to 1,600 feet (300 to 500 meters). The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches (432 to 483 millimeters). The mean annual temperature is about is 59 to 63 degrees F (15 to 17 degrees C). Frost free season is 190 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Pinncamp series. Pinncamp soils are under live oak trees and have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium or high runoff; rapid permeability. These soils do not flood or pond.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for watershed, wildlife habitat and recreation. Vegetation is buckwheat and annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: San Benito County, California in MLRA 14  Central California Coastal Valleys. These soils are of small extent.
