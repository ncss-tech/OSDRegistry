TAYLORSPRING SERIES

The Taylorspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. These soils are on fan remnants, hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Taylorspring gravelly sandy loam, in rangeland, on a 20 percent slope, at an elevation of 2201 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

   A--0 to 15 cm; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 25 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 18 cm thick)

   BA--15 to 33 cm; light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/3) cobbly sandy loam, reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) moist, moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 25 cm thick)

   Bt--33 to 69 cm; red (10R 5/6) extremely cobbly sandy clay, red (10R 4/6) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; extremely hard, very firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 70 percent distinct clay films on all faces of peds; 25 percent gravel and 40 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (35 to 52 cm thick)

   BCk--69 to 152 cm; light red (10R 6/6) very cobbly sandy clay loam, red (10R 5/6) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel and 25 percent cobbles; 15 percent distinct calcium carbonate nodules on bottom of rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).
