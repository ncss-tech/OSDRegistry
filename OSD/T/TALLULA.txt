TALLULA SERIES

The Tallula series consists of deep, well drained moderately permeable soils formed in loess on side slopes of uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tallula silt loam - on a 10 percent slope with a southeast aspect in a pastured area.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.

   A1--0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; strong fine granular structure; friable; common very fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

   A2--10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; common very fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  [Combined thickness of the A horizons is 18 to 38 cm (7 to 15 inches).]

   Bw1--25 to 41 cm (10 to 16 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; weak very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; many faint dark brown (10YR 3/3) organic coatings on faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.

   Bw2--41 to 66 cm (16 to 26 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; common faint brown (10YR 4/3) coatings on faces of peds; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  [Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 13 to 56 cm (5 to 22 inches).]

   C1--66 to 79 cm (26 to 31 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam; many medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; friable; few very fine roots; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

   C2--79 to 152 cm (31 to 60 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt; many medium and coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles; massive; friable; few very fine roots; few fine concretions (calcium carbonate); few fine dark accumulations (iron and manganese oxides); slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Cass County, Illinois; about 1 mile northwest of Virginia; 1330 feet south and 154 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 4, T. 17 N., R. 10 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Thickness of the mollic epipedon: commonly 18 to 38 cm (7 to 15 inches)
Thickness of the solum: 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches), but range from 38 to 89 cm (15 to 35 inches)
Depth to free carbonates: commonly 51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches), but range from 38 to 89 cm (15 to 35 inches0

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry)
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture; silt loam

Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: silt loam
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR

COMPETING SERIES:  Tallula is the only established series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tallula soils are on side slopes of uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in loess.  Mean annual temperature varies from 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 710 to 915 mm (28 to 36 inches).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Bold and Port Byron soils and the Elkhart and Tama soils.  Bold soils are downslope from the Tallula soils, or are on similar parts of the landscape nearby.  The fine-silty Port Byron, Elkhart, and Tama soils are on nearby landscapes typically upslope from the Tallula soils or on the crests of interstream divides.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The less sloping areas are used for corn, soybeans, small grain, and meadow; the steeper slopes are used for pasture. Native vegetation was prairie grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Illinois, Minnesota, and Iowa in MLRAs 104, 108B, 108D, and 115C.  These soils have small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Indianapolis, Indiana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cass County, Illinois, 1939.

REMARKS:  These soils were previously called well drained and moderately well drained.  The mottles in the C horizon are believed to be unrelated to present drainage conditions.  These soils do not have a water table above a depth of 6 feet for 30 consecutive days.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (A1 and A2 horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 25 to 66 cm (10 to 26 inches) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).
