TRAG SERIES

The Trag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite and schist.  Trag soils are on mountains, slopes and fans.   Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Trag sandy loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 9 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocks parting to moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 15 inches thick)

   BA--9 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak medium prisms parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; thin patchy clay films; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 12 inches thick)

   Bt--15 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prisms parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm; thin nearly continuous clay films; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (16 to 34 inches thick)

   C--35 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable; neutral.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trag soils are on mountain slopes and fans.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  The soil formed in material weathered from granite and schist that has been locally transported in places.  Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,900 feet.  The soils are in a cool semiarid climate with annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 22 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost- free season is about 65 to 100 days.  In New Mexico, precipitation ranges to 22 inches with air temperatures down to 40 degrees F. and frost-free periods up to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boyle, Bruce, Ratake, and Wetmore soils and the competing Farnuf and Moen soils.  Boyle, Ratake and Wetmore soils have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Bruce soils are coarse-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for rangeland.  Native vegetation is mainly blue grama, big and little bluestem, junegrass, some forbs and shrubs, and widely spaced ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous parts of Northern and central Colorado, eastern Utah, and central New Mexico.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Larimer County, Colorado, 1975.  The name is a coined name.

REMARKS:  This soil has:
Mollic Epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 15 inches
Argillic Horizon:  The zone from 15 to 35 inches
Prior to 2/1999 OSD update the classification was a Typic Argiboroll, fine-loamy, mixed.  The 2/1999 update reclassified this series to a Pachic Argiustoll, fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid.  Historically this series concept was not pachic.  Therefore, in this update a one inch reduction in the thickness of the mollic epipedon was incorporated and adjustment to the range in characteristics to maintain the series concept as typic.
