TURON SERIES

The Turon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over a buried alluvial soil. These soils are on dunes on paleoterraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains, MLRA 79. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 740 millimeters (29 inches), at the type location.

Landform: dunes on paleoterraces
Slopes: 0 to 10 percent
Elevation: 505 to 795 meters (1650 to 2600 feet)

Frost-free period: 180 to 200 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
These are the Attica, Carway, Naron, and Tivin soils. 
Attica soils are on lower sloping dunes and have finer materials in the particle size control section (coarse-loamy).
Carway soils are on interdune areas and have finer materials in the particle size control section (fine-loamy) and have a perched water table.
Naron soils are on lower sloping dunes and have finer materials in the particle size control section (fine-loamy).
Tivin soils are on higher sloping dunes and do not have an increase of clay (argillic horizon) or lamellae in the subsoil.
 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage: Well drained 
Runoff: very low or low. 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: High in the upper part and Moderately High in the lower part
Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part of the profile and typically moderately slow in the lower part. The lower part of the profile has slow or moderate permeability in some pedons. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Gentler slopes are usually cultivated; grain sorghum is the principal crop with lesser acreage of wheat and alfalfa. Steeper slopes are in native range. Native vegetation is dominated by sand bluestem, indiangrass, and little bluestem. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South Central Kansas. LRR H Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range, MLRA 79 Great Bend Sand Plains. The series is of small extent.
