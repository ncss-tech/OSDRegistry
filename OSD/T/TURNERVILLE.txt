TURNERVILLE SERIES

The Turnerville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick, weakly calcareous eolian silts that have been partially reworked by water in some areas. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive Ustic Glossocryalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Turnerville silt loam, forested. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    0i--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed forest litter. 

    0e--1 to 3 inches; partially decomposed forest litter. 

    E1--3 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; fine crumb structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    E2--6 to 18 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; thick platy structure that parts to very fine subangular blocks and granules; vesicular; soft, very friable, sticky and plastic; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (4 to 24 inches thick) 

    E/B--18 to 33 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist and brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; thin glossy patches on faces of the most clayey peds, this horizon contains nodules and seams of clayey material like that of the underlying horizon embedded in a light colored matrix like that of the overlying horizon; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (8 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bt--33 to 53 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; faint continuous clay filmss on faces of peds and in pores; surface coatings of uncoated sand and silt; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual smooth boundary. (12 to 30 inches thick) 

    BC--53 to 63 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few faint clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6), gradual wavy boundary. (6 to 12 inches thick) 

    C--63 to 70 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; neutral (pH 7.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Lincoln County, Wyoming; approximately 300 feet southwest of the NE corner of section 22, T.33N., R.118W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: In some pedons the E1 horizon is discontinuous. The solum ranges from 30 to 60 or more inches thick. Usually these soils are noncalcareous to depths in excess of 60 inches but are weakly and inconsistently calcareous below depths of 40 inches in some pedons. Organic carbon in the surface horizons ranges from .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with depth. The soil is 60 to 100 percent base-saturated. Rock fragments are usually less than 3 percent and range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F. 

The E2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has thick platy structure but it has granular or fine subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. 

The Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silty clay loam or silt loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon usually has subangular blocky structure but has very weak prismatic structure in some pedons. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. 

The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. 

COMPETING SERIES: This is the similar Auggie series. Auggie soils have a udic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Turnerville soils are on uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 5,600 to 7,500 feet. The soils formed in thick, weakly calcareous, eolian silts that have been partly reworked by water in places. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation in most months. Mean annual air temperature is about 30 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 50 to 75 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cowdrey, Greys and Robana soils. Cowdrey soils have B2t horizons with more than 35 percent clay. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used for production of barley, oats, alfalfa, and pasture and for forestry purposes. Native vegetation is lodgepole pine with an understory of grasses and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Wyoming and Idaho. The series is of moderate extent.
