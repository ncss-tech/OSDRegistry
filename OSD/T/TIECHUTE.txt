TIECHUTE SERIES

The Tiechute series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on stream terraces and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Aridic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tiechute gravelly sandy loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at 1,032 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated.)

    A--0 to 18 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots and common medium roots; many fine irregular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (18 to 36 cm thick)

    AC--18 to 30 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) gravelly sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine irregular pores; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 15 cm thick)

    C1--30 to 61 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loamy sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    C2--61 to 152 cm; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) extremely cobbly coarse sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 25 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Bing topographic quadrangle, Ravalli County, Montana; 10 meters north and 500 meters west of the SE corner of section 28, T. 8 N., R. 20 W. UTM Zone 11: 722844e, 5144162n, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature - 5 to 8 degrees C
Mollic epipedon thickness - 18 to 36 cm

Some pedons have an AB horizon in place of the AC horizon.

A horizon 
Value: 4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 1 to 3 dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam or loam
Clay content: 10 to 20 percent
Rock fragments: 10 to 55 percent--10 to 45 percent gravel; 0 to 20 percent cobbles
Reaction: pH 6.6 to 7.8

AC horizon 
Value: 5 or 6 dry; 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam or loamy sand
Clay content: 5 to 18 percent
Rock fragments: 15 to 60 percent--15 to 50 percent gravel; 0 to 30 percent cobbles
Reaction: pH 6.6 to 7.8

C horizon(s)
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y  
Value: 6 or 7 dry; 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist
Texture: loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand or coarse sand 
Clay content: 0 to 10 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 85 percent--25 to 65 percent gravel; 0 to 45 percent cobbles
Reaction: pH 6.6 to 7.8

COMPETING SERIES:
Dominson (CO, UT) - have secondary calcium carbonate accumulation in the subsoil
Drygulch (MT) - are dominated by 2 to 10 mm sized rock fragments in the particle-size control section
Millpoint (MT) - have a Bw horizon
Vendome (MT) - have a cambic horizon; have horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - stream terraces and inset fans
Elevation - 975 to 1,310 meters
Slope - 0 to 4 percent
Parent material - alluvium 
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers
Mean annual precipitation - 305 to 380 mm, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain
Mean annual air temperature - 4 to 7 degrees C
Frost-free period - 90 to 120 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; moderate permeability to a depth of 30 cm, rapid and very rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION: Tiechute soils are mainly used for irrigated pasture and hayland, or for dry-land pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tiechute soils are of small extent in valleys of western Montana. MLRA 44A.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bitterroot Valley Area, Montana, 2013; proposed in Ravalli County, Montana, 2006.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 18 cm (A horizon) 
Particle-size control section - from 25 to 100 cm (part of the 
AC, C1, and part of the C2 horizons)

Tiechute soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

Significant areas of Tiechute were previously mapped as Dominic series in the Bitterroot Valley Area.
