TILMA SERIES

The Tilma series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess. Tilma soils are on loess plains and hills, mainly near drainageways. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Argialbolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tilma silt loam - on a 7 percent southeast-facing slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Latah, Quicksell, and Setnum series. Latah soils have redoximorphic features in the Bt horizons and are somewhat poorly drained. Quicksell soils have mollic epipedons 10 to 16 inches thick, have 5 percent gravel throughout, and have 20 to 40 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Setnum soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on plains and hills on plateaus, mainly near drainageways. Slopes range from about 3 to 25 percent. Elevations are 2,300 to 3,200 feet. The soils formed in older loess, probably mostly of the recent or Pinedale surface, Early Bull Lake or Pre Bull Lake. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches. The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Garfield, Palouse, Naff, and Thatuna soils. Garfield soils are on convex summits, have an ochric epipedon, and lack an E horizon. Palouse and Naff soils have fine-silty control sections and lack an E horizon, and are on smooth back slopes. Thatuna soils have a fine-silty control section and are on back slopes and foot slopes that are commonly concave.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; medium to rapid runoff; slow permeability. A seasonally perched water table is present from 18 to 30 inches in the winter to late spring.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are under cultivation. Small grains, hay, pasture, lentils, and peas are the major crops. Principal vegetation of uncultivated areas is Idaho fescue, wild rose, snowberry and small forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Loess hills and plains region in the prairies in northern Idaho and eastern Washington. MLRA 9. Moderately extensive.
