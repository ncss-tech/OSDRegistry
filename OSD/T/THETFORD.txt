THETFORD SERIES

The Thetford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy till or outwash on ground moraines, end moraines, lake plains, outwash plains, terraces, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Aquic Arenic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Thetford loamy sand, on a southwest-facing, concave slope of 2 percent in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 15 cm (6 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy sand, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 E1--15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy sand; weak fine granular structure; friable; many fine roots; few fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron in the lower part; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 E2--30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine roots; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; common fine  distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the E horizon is 0 to 64 cm (25 inches).]

 E and Bt--61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches); very pale brown (10YR 8/3) loamy sand (E); single grain; loose; common fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; common fine faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; discontinuous yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam horizontal bands (Bt), 6 mm to 8 cm thick; weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; clay bridging of sand grains and common faint clay films; common fine distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions (Bt); neutral; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 91 cm (6 to 36 inches) thick]

 Bt--127 to 140 cm (50 to 55 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sand; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; clay bridging of sand grains and common faint clay films; common fine prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron; common fine distinct gray (10YR 6/1) iron depletions; neutral; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 C--140 to 168 cm (55 to 66 inches); mottled gray (10YR 6/1), brown (10YR 5/3), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) very fine sand; single grain; loose; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Livingston County, Michigan; about 6 miles north of Fowlerville; 660 feet north and 75 feet east of the center of sec. 9, T. 4 N., R. 3 E.; USGS Corunna SE topographic quadrangle; lat. 42 degrees 45 minutes 8.018 seconds N. and long. 84 degrees 6 minutes 26.78 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 76 to more 152 cm (30 to more than 60 inches)
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral in the upper part, and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part

Ap horizon:
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent gravel

E horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent gravel

E part of the E and Bt horizon:
Value: 4 to 8
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent gravel

Bt part of the E and Bt horizon, and the Bt horizon
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam; in those pedons with sandy loam or fine sandy loam bands the control section averages less than 15 percent clay and has less than 50 percent fine sand and averages as sand or loamy sand
Special features: bands or lamellae are 6 mm to 8 cm (1/4 to 3 inches) thick and have a total thickness of (6 inches) or more; clay bridging of sand grains is evident in the coarser textures and thin clay coatings are apparent in pores, in root channels, and on some of the vertical and horizontal faces of peds
Rock fragment content: 0 to 5 percent gravel

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 1 to 4
Texture: very fine sand, fine sand, or sand; some pedons have layers with finer textures
Rock fragment content: 0 to 25 percent gravel 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Thetford soils are in nearly level or depressional areas on ground moraine, end moraines, till plains, lake plains, outwash plains, terraces, and beach ridges of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradients are predominantly 0 to 2 percent but range from 0 to 4 percent. Thetford soils formed in sandy till or outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Oakville and Spinks soils and the somewhat poorly drained Tedrow soils are the most common associates. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Granby series is associated in some areas.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between February and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Permeability is moderately rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, and grass-legume hay are the principal crops. Some areas are idle or used for permanent pasture. Native vegetation is principally mixed hardwoods, with northern red oak, bitternut hickory, red maple, and American elm the dominant species.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 97, 98, 99, and 111B in southern lower Michigan. The series is of large extent.
