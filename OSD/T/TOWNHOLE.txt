TOWNHOLE SERIES

The Townhole series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on strath terraces, structural benches, and terraces. They formed in colluvium and the underlying slope alluvium and old alluvium and/or residuum from cherty limestone, dolomite, or shale. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Townhole soils are on strath terraces, structural benches, and high stream terraces in the Ozarks. Slopes are convex or linear and range from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in cherty or silty colluvium, slope alluvium and old alluvium and/or residuum from cherty limestone, dolomite, or shale in Mississippian geology. The mean annual temperature varies from 57 to 59 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 38 to 48 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cedargap, Goss, Hailey, Jollymill, and Rueter soils.  Cedargap soils are mollisols and are on the adjacent floodplains. Jollymill soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock.  Goss soils have a clayey-skeletal particle size class. Rueter soils are somewhat excessively drained. Hailey soils are excessively drained. Jollymill, Rueter, and Goss soils are on side slopes. Hailey soils are on shoulder slopes and side slopes.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained, slow or medium runoff, slow permeability.  The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. A saturated zone is present at 1.5 to 3.0 feet for a month or more from late fall to late spring in most years. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of these soils are cleared and used for pasture and hayland. A few areas remain forested.  Native vegetation is dominantly mixed hardwoods and pine. Native vegetation in areas bordering the Cherokee Prairie is savanna. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The Ozarks region of Missouri (MLRA 116B). This series is of small extent; about 4,800 acres have been mapped to date.
