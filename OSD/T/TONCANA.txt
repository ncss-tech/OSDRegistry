TONCANA SERIES

The Toncana series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite.  These soils are on north- and east-facing mountain sides. Slopes are 40 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Ultic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Toncana loam, rangeland. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 3 cm; loose leaves and twigs. (0 to 5 cm thick)

    A1--3 to 13 cm; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and common medium roots; many fine and very fine pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--13 to 33 cm; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; moderate medium granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, fine and few medium and coarse roots; many very fine, fine and few medium pores; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary.

    A3--33 to 63 cm; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few coarse roots; many very fine and few fine pores; 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A1, A2 and A3 horizons - 50 to 85 cm)

    Bt1--63 to 83 cm; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine and few fine pores; common thin clay films as bridges and in pores; 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary.

    Bt2--83 to 103 cm; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) very gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine pores; continuous thin clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt1 and Bt2 horizons - 40 to 100 cm)

    Bt3--103 to 154 cm; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) very gravelly clay loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) dry; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few fine and medium roots; few very fine pores; continuous thin clay films on faces of peds; 35 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0).

TYPE LOCATION: Morgan County, Utah; about 2 km south and 6 km east of Morgan County Courthouse; about 410 meters east and 150 meters north of the southwest corner of sec. 3, T.3N., R.3E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature--6 to 8 degrees C

The soils are usually moist but are dry for 65 to 85 consecutive days during late summer.
Combined thickness of A and Bt horizons--140 to more than 150 cm over bedrock
Base saturation--less than 75 percent in part or all parts above a depth of 75 cm
Rock fragment content in the A horizon--0 to 20 percent

Particle-size control section:
Clay content--30 to 35 percent
Rock fragment content--35 to 60 percent, consisting of rounded quartzite gravel and cobbles

A horizons
Hue--10YR through 5YR
Value--3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma--2 or 3 dry and moist

B2t horizon
Hue--5YR through 2.5YR (7.5YR in the upper part in some pedons)
Value--5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma--4 through 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Durst, Henhoit and Smarts series.  Burst and Henhoit soils have mollic epipedons less than 50 cm thick.   Smarts soils have 7.5YR or 10YR hue in all parts of the Bt horizon.  They are no redder than 7.5YR in any part.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained-medium runoff moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Toncana soils are used for range, wildlife habitat, and waterhead. The present native vegetation is oakbrush, snowberry, ninebark, wild sweetpea, native bluegrass, yarrow, mountain bromegrass, big sagebrush, slender wheatgrass, and Oregon grape.
