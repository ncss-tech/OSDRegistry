TREMENTINA SERIES

The Trementina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Trementina soils are on terraces and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches (330 to 460 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 48 to 53 degrees F (9 to 12 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Trementina silt loam - grassland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A1--0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.

   A2--15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 10 to 20 inches)

   Bw1--38 to 56 cm (15 to 22 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. 

   Bw2--56 to 76 cm (22 to 30 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the Bw horizons is 10 to 25 inches)

   Bk1--76 to 112 cm (30 to 44 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; strongly effervescent; common medium irregular soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

   Bk2--112 to 165 cm (44 to 65 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; violently effervescent; few fine irregular soft masses of lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ackman (UT), Alcester (SD), Gabaldon (NM), Irak (CO), Muir (KS), Shell (NE), and Tobin (KS)  series.  
Ackman, Alcester, Muir, and Shell soils: lack carbonates above a depth of 36 inches.  
Gabaldon soils: are calcareous above a depth of 15 inches. 
Irak soils: are somewhat poorly drained with a water table of 1 to 3 feet.  
Tobin soils: lack Bw horizons and have mean annual precipitation ranging from 20 to 30 inches and mean annual temperature of 53 to 58 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Alluvium from mixed sources
Landform: Deeply dissected terraces, and narrow drainageways.
Slopes: 0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 1370 to 2300 meters (4,500 to 7,500 feet)
Mean annual air temperature: 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F).
Mean annual precipitation: 330 to 460 millimeters (14 to 18 inches)
  Wettest months: April through August
  Driest months: December through February
Frost-free period: 120 to days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
These are the Manzano soils.  Manzano soils average more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the control.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: well drained, low runoff, moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Flooding rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as rangeland and as irrigated pasture.  Native vegetation is mainly western wheatgrass, needleandthread, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Colorado: LRR G, MLRA's 67, 69 and a small part of 49.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Las Animas County, Colorado 2007.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle size control section: The zone from 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 inches). (Part of the A2, Bw1, Bw2 and part of the Bk1 horizons)
Mollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 112 (0 to 44 inches) the A1, A2, Bw1, Bw2, and Bk1 horizons
Calcic horizon: the zone from 76 to 165 (30 to 65 inches) the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons

Remarks:
The Trementina series replaces the Tobin series in the Aridic-Ustic moisture regime. This revision moves the type location to the eastern part of Las Animas County.
Added metric units, revised saturated hydraulic conductivity, made edits to landform.  WAW 4/12/7007
