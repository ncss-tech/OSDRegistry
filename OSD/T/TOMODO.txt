TOMODO SERIES

The Tomodo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy colluvium with a thick volcanic ash mantle.  They are on mountain slopes, ridges and structural benches.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low and slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tomodo soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and structural benches at elevations of 1,700 to 4,200 feet (518 to 1280 meters) with slopes of 15 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in loamy colluvium with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  The average annual temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches (762 to 1270 mm). The frost free season is 50 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lado, Norwidge and Threebear soils.  The Lado soils are on hills and do not have fragic characteristics.  Norwidge soils are on hills and have silt loam and silty clay loam textures in the argillic horizon.  Threebear soils are on hills and are moderately deep to a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff and moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Potential natural vegetation is western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir and western larch with an understory of queencup beadlily, starry false Solomons-seal, longtube twin flower, bunchberry dogwood, goldthread, darkwoods violet, common snowberry and Columbia brome.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: North central Idaho; Tomodo soils are not extensive.  MLRA 43A.
