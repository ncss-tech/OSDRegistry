TAYLORPEAK SERIES

The Taylorpeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rocks. Taylorpeak soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1520 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal over fragmental, mixed, superactive, isomesic Typic Humustepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Taylorpeak very gravelly loam; on a west facing convex slope of 48 percent under Douglas-fir seedlings, swordfern, and foxglove. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.) When described on June 7, 2007, the soil was dry throughout.

 A1--0 to 20 centimeters; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) very gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine and medium roots throughout; many very fine tubular pores; 40 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel and 5 percent strongly cemented sandstone cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

 A2--20 to 40 centimeters; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak very fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots throughout; common very fine irregular pores; 45 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel, 5 percent strongly cemented sandstone cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary.

 A3--40 to 90 centimeters; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and common fine, medium, and very coarse roots throughout; common very fine and fine irregular pores; 50 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel and 5 percent strongly cemented sandstone cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 25 to 100 centimeters)

 C1--90 to 120 centimeters; gravel; many very fine and common fine and medium roots in cracks; bedrock with fractures 5 to 10 centimeters apart; 85 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel, 10 percent strongly cemented sandstone cobbles; gradual wavy boundary.

 C2--120 to 180 centimeters; gravel; many very fine and common fine roots in cracks; bedrock with fractures 5 to 10 centimeters apart; 83 percent strongly cemented sandstone gravel, 15 percent strongly cemented sandstone cobbles; (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 50 to 150 centimeters)

TYPE LOCATION: Humboldt County, California; about 10 kilometers southwest of the town of Ferndale; USGS Capetown Quadrangle; WGS84 Decimal degrees 40.4911111 latitude and -124.3061111 longitude; UTM zone 10 389296mE, 4483103mN; NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years, and moist in some part for 180 cumulative days per year or for 90 or more consecutive days. The soils have an ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 9 to 11 degrees C. The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is less than 6 degrees C. The soils have an isomesic soil temperature regime.

Umbric Epipedon: 50 to 100 centimeters thick

Depth to bedrock with cracks closer than 10 centimeters apart: 70 to 100 centimeters

Surface Fragments: 0 to 14 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles.

Particle size control section (weighted average): 
Rock fragments: 35 to 80 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles
Clay content: 12 to 20 percent 

Reaction: strongly to moderately acid

A horizons:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 , 1 or 2 moist 
Texture of fine earth: loam
Clay content: 10 to 22 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 59 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones

Bw or Bt horizons when present:
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR 
Value: 4 to 7, 3 or 4 moist 
Chroma: 3 or 4 dry or moist
Texture of fine earth: loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam 
Clay content: 12 to 24 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 89 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones

C horizons:
Texture: gravel
Rock fragments: 80 to 95 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, 0 to 5 percent stones

COMPETING SERIES: At this time there are no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Taylorpeak soils are on convex summit and shoulder positions on ridges and mountain slopes. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 5 to 855 meters. These soils formed in residuum weathered from strongly to very strongly cemented sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rocks. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2280 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 330 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caperidge and Northbear soils. Caperidge soils lack bedrock with fractures closer than 10 centimeters apart within 200 centimeters and are on slightly concave or convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes. Northbear soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on linear to slightly concave or convex positions on summits, shoulders, and backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; moderate to high runoff; moderately high to high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for timber production, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation includes Douglas-fir, tanoak, grand fir, California huckleberry, swordfern, and oceanspray. Where this series occurs at higher elevations and in its southern extent, grand fir is absent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Coastal Redwood Belt 4B. The series is not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California
