TAMARACK SERIES 

The Tamarack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash terraces, kame terraces, outwash plains and escarpments in valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitations is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Vitrandic Eutrudepts 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tamarack ashy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    E--2 to 5 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) ashy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; volcanic ash component; moderately acid (ph 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick) 

    Bw--5 to 14 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) ashy fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse roots; slightly acid (ph 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (7 to 10 inches thick) 

    2E and Bt1--14 to 32 inches; E part (85 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist, Bt part (15 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist, broken discontinuous lamellae 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; moderately acid (ph 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

    2E and Bt2--32 to 46 inches; E part (80 percent) is very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist, Bt part (20 percent) is brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist, broken discontinuous lamellae 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse roots; moderately acid (ph 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick) 

    2C--46 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly acid (ph 6.2).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tamarack soils are used mainly as woodland, understory grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, grand fir, and Engelmann spruce.  Understory vegetation is mainly pinegrass, huckleberry, sedges, and forbs.
