TICELL SERIES

The Ticell series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or loess deposited over sandstone or residuum.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Ticell loam, cultivated (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--6 to 11 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) heavy silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; common soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 7 inches thick)

    Bk2--11 to 15 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 5 percent sandstone fragments; common soft masses of lime; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 6 inches thick)

    R--15 inches; indurated sandstone.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0034. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 6 inches (Ap horizon)
Calcic horizon - the zone from 6 to 15 inches (Bk horizons)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 15 inches (part of Bk1 and Bk2 horizons). 

Ticell soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
