TROOK SERIES

The Trook series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 178 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Trook sandy loam, 1 percent slope in rangeland at an elevation of 1,624 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 18 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine vesicular pores; slightly effervescent; 3 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (13 to 25 cm thick)

    Bk1--18 to 30 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; common threadlike calcium carbonate masses in the matrix; 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); diffuse wavy boundary. 

    Bk2--30 to 69 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; many threadlike calcium carbonate masses and many calcium carbonate concretions around rock fragments; violently effervescent; 20 percent gravel; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); diffuse irregular boundary. (combined thickness of Bk horizons is 35 to 60 cm)

    BCk1--69 to 107 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) gravelly sandy loam, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; many threadlike calcium carbonate masses in the matrix and many calcium carbonate concretions around rock fragments; 20 percent gravel; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); diffuse irregular boundary. (25 to 50 cm thick)

    BCk2--107 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine interstitial pores; common threadlike calcium carbonate masses in the matrix and common calcium carbonate concretions around rock fragments; 25 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4).

Slope - 0 to 15 percent
Parent material - alluvium or colluvium
Mean annual precipitation - 125 to 230 mm
Mean annual air temperature - 6 to 8 degrees C
Frost-free period - 110 to 150 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid and rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Trook soils are generally used as rangeland; however, they may be cultivated and irrigated to produce alfalfa hay, barley, sugar beets, corn, silage, or beans where water is available. Principal native plants are bluebunch wheatgrass, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, thickspike wheatgrass and Wyoming big sagebrush. As this site deteriorates blue grama, threadleaf sedge, threeawn and prickly pear cactus become the dominate vegetation. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Trook soils are of moderate extent in northwestern Wyoming. MLRA 32 and 34B.
