TROFES SERIES

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no competing series for this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Trofes soils are on low stream terraces of basin floors. They formed in eolian, lacustrine, and alluvial material derived from mixed sources. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arojomil, Hyer, and Spyglass soils. Arojomil soils are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon, do not have secondary gypsum, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus.  Hyer soils are fine-silty, do not have secondary gypsum, and occur on summits of undulating plains. Spyglass soils have gypsic horizons above forty inches and occur on floodplain steps of basin floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; permeability moderately slow 

USE AND VEGETATION: Trofes soils are used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and recreation. Present vegetation is blue grama, walkingstick cholla, and four-wing saltbush.
 
DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Trofes soils are of small extent in the central part of the Estancia Basin in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in northcentral to central New Mexico, MLRA 70C.

SERIES PROPOSED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2003. Trofes is a coined name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to about 2 inches (A horizon)
Argillic horizon - 2 to about 55 inches (Bt, Btk1, Btk2, Btky1 and Btky2 horizons) 
Calcic horizon - 9 to about 80 inches (Btk1, Btk2, Btky1, Btky2, Bky, By1 and By2 horizons)

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location has been sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S-NM-02-049-006; calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a field calcimeter.
