TOUZALIN SERIES

The Touzalin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy fluvial sediments of Holocene age.  These soils occur on nearly level to undulating flood plains in the Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA-77E).  The slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm (21 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, thermic Oxyaquic Ustifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON: Touzalin loam - on a less than 1 percent linear slope in native rangeland at approximately 750 meters (2475 feet) elevation. When described, a seasonal water table was present at 91 centimeters (36 inches).

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland.  Native vegetation is tall grasses with small percent of trees, mainly eastern cottonwood and tamarisk.  Some areas are cultivated to bermudagrass, weeping lovegrass, winter wheat, and forage sorghums.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern High Plains, Breaks (MLRA-77E in LRR H) of northwestern Oklahoma, the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, and adjacent areas of Southwestern Kansas.  This soil is moderately extensive.
