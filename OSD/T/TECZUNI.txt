TECZUNI SERIES

The Teczuni series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium, slope alluvium, and fan alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Teczuni soils are on dipslopes of cuestas, ridges, toeslopes of hills and fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Teczuni loam--rangeland (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; soft and very friable; many very fine and fine roots; many medium and fine vesicular pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 3 inches thick)

    Bt1--2 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine irregular pores; common distinct clay films coating faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 17 to 31 inches.)

    Bt2--6 to 16 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few medium and common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films coating faces of peds; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 17 to 31 inches.)

    Btk--16 to 33 inches; strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium prismatic structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; many prominent clay films coating faces of peds; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as common medium and fine soft seams, filaments, and masses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 17 inches thick)

    Bk1--33 to 47 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as common coarse soft seams and masses; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (The combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 32 to 45 inches.)

    Bk2--47 to 65 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent; calcium carbonate occurs as many medium soft masses, seams, and filaments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8). (The combined thickness of the Bk horizons is 32 to 45 inches.)

TYPE LOCATION: McKinley County, New Mexico; Shoemaker Canyon Quadrangle; about 5 miles east-southeast of Jacks Lake on the Zuni Indian Reservation; 2,600 feet north and 2,200 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 34, T 9 N, R 16 W; 108 degrees 30 minutes 52 seconds west longitude, 34 degrees 57 minutes 58 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: The SMCS is usually moist, in all parts for less than 90 cumulative days from April through October. It is usually dry, in some part, for more than 120 cumulative days during the same period. It is continuously moist in some part November through March. The period of maximum precipitation is July through October. The soil is driest during May and June. Aridic ustic moisture regime.

Soil Temperature: 50 to 55 degrees F

Particle-size control section: averages 40 to 50 percent clay

Depth to calcic horizon: 20 to 45 inches

A horizon:
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Chroma: 4 or 6
Texture: clay loam or clay
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent

Bk horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Texture: clay, clay loam, sandy clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 30 percent
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Jacee (NM), Paguate (NM), Ramah (NM) and Teco (NM) series. Ramah soils have cooler mean annual temperatures. Jacee and Paguate soils are moderately deep to a lithic or paralithic contact. Teco soils have gravelly moderately coarse textured calcic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Teczuni soils formed in eolian material and alluvium, slope alluvium, and fan alluvium derived from sandstone and shale and are on toeslopes of hills and ridges and fan remnants on valley sides, and dipslopes of cuestas. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 6,800 to 7,200 feet. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches. The frost free period is 115 to 135 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Silcat soils on valley floors and sides; the Flugle soils on fan terraces; and the Toldohn and Vessilla soils on escarpments. The Silcat soils lack an argillic horizon and have vertic properties. The Flugle soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and lack a calcic horizon. The Toldohn and Vessilla soils are very shallow and shallow to shale and sandstone.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, and slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: This series is used for rangeland. The present vegetation is blue grama, western wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, bottlebrush squirreltail, winterfat, rabbitbrush, spineless horsebrush, and scattered pinyon and oneseed juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West central New Mexico. MLRA 35, LRR-D.  This series is of small extent.
