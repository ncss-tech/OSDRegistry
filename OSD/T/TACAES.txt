Doroshin soils lack sapric soil material and have a clay content range of less than 3 percent
Hewitt soils have mineral strata between organic horizons.
Mineralcreek soils have A horizons and occur on flood plains in till plains. 
Runkelscreek soils have ponding and mineral substratum textures of loam and very fine sandy loam.
Stanbro soils have a mean annual air temperature of 4 degrees C (39 degrees F) and gravelly clay loam textures in the mineral horizons.
Tepete soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the mineral substratum and have a mean annual air temperature of 1 to 6 degrees C (34 to 43 degrees F)
