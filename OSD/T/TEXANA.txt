TEXANA SERIES

The Texana series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of late Pleistocene age.  These soils are on relic meander belts on flat coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 in).

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Jackson County, Texas; 1986.  The name is from an early community in Jackson County.

REMARKS:  These soils have formerly been included in the Telferner, Edna, and Katy series. The classification was changed in 2016. Soil moisture studies on soils with similar characteristics and field observations show that saturation and reduction do not occur in years of normal rainfall.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (A horizon)
Albic horizon: 25 to 36 cm (10 to 14 in) (E horizon)
Abrupt textural change: from E horizon to Bt horizon.
Argillic horizon: 36 to 175 cm (14 to 69 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Btk, and 2BCt horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: 175 to 229 cm (69 to 90 in) (2BCt horizon).
