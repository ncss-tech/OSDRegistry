TOOTALL SERIES

The Tootall series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium weathered from sandstone, shale and mudstone. These soils are on hillslopes and fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Torrertic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Tootall sandy clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

 A--0 to 8 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3), moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, soft, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many very fine and common medium roots; many very fine dendritic tubular pores; slight effervescence; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 14 cm thick) 

 Bt1--8 to 21 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine angular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, very sticky, very plastic; many very fine and few medium roots; many fine tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; strong effervescence; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. 

 Bt2--21 to 70 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/3), moist; moderate medium angular blocky structure; friable, slightly hard, very sticky, very plastic; common very fine roots; common medium tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (Combined thickness of Bt1 and Bt2 - 23 to 62 cm) 

 Btk--70 to 100 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3), moist; moderate coarse angular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; few fine dendritic tubular pores; 10 percent faint clay films on all faces of peds; 8 percent medium spherical carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary. (22 to 49 cm thick) 

 Bk--100 to 152 cm; brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3), moist; strong very coarse angular blocky structure; firm, moderately hard, very sticky, very plastic; few fine interstitial pores; 10 percent faint pressure faces on all faces of peds; 10 percent medium spherical carbonate masses in matrix; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.
