TAYLOW SERIES

The Taylow series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum from sandstone or siltstone. Taylow soils are on mountain slopes and hills. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Taylow loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

 A--0 to 6 inches; reddish gray (5YR 5/2) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

 Bw--6 to 13 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/4) loam, dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 11 inches thick)

 R--13 inches; red sandstone

TYPE LOCATION: Bear Lake County, Idaho; approximately 4 miles southwest of Pegram; about 554 feet south and 2,245 feet west of the northeast corner of section 26, T. 15 S., R. 45 E.; USGS Pegram Creek 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude - 42 degrees, 05 minutes, 40.5 seconds north, longitude - 111 degrees, 09 minutes, 31.4 seconds west, NAD 83.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the:
Choptie (OR+UT)  have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section .
Doyn (OR)  are very shallow and do not have Bw horizons.
Nuss (OR)  are dry in the moisture control section for more than 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.
Quicksilver (ID)  have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Sadorus (ID)  have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Spaa (UT+ID)  have an accumulation of secondary carbonates below the A horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: mountain slopes and hills
Elevation: 6,000 to 7,600 feet
Slope: 2 to 60 percent
Parent material: alluvium and/or slope alluvium over red sandstone or red siltstone
Climate: long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry, summers. 
Average annual precipitation: 12 to 18 inches
Average annual temperature: 39 to 44 degrees F. 
Frost-free season: 70 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Church Springs, Cooley, Cupine, Jebo, and Lonjon series,  Church Springs soils are very deep and have carbonates to the surface.  Cooley soils are very deep, have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, and have layers of carbonate accumulation.  Cupine soils are moderately deep and have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Jebo soils are moderately deep, have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, and have layers of carbonate accumulation.  Lonjon soils are moderately deep, have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, and have a carbonatic mineralogy.  Church Springs soils are on less sloping more uniform areas.  Cooley, Cupine, and Lonjon soils are on similar positions to Taylow.  Jebo soils are on less sloping ridge areas.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to rapid surface runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Taylow soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sage, basin big sage, bluebunch wheatgrass, antelope bitterbrush, serviceberry, snowberry, rabbitbrush, arrowleaf balsamroot and a few mountain mahogany.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Idaho. These soils are of small extent in MLRA 43B.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Bear Lake County, Idaho, 2008. The name is derived from the nearby Taylor Meadow.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Mollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches mixed (the A horizon and part of the Bw horizon).
