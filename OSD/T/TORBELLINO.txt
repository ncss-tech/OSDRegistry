TORBELLINO SERIES

The Torbellino series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gypsiferous eolian deposits and/or gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on playa interdunes. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-gypseous, hypergypsic, thermic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Torbellino gypsiferous sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

     Cyy1--0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm); light gray (2.5Y 7/1) gypsiferous sandy loam, gray (2.5Y 6/1), moist; 11 percent clay; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine irregular pores; carbonate, finely disseminated and gypsum, finely disseminated throughout; slightly effervescent, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and 65 percent gypsum; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2; electrical conductivity 3.3 dS/m (mmhos/cm); very slightly saline; clear smooth boundary.

     Cyy2--6 to 17 inches (15 to 43 cm); light gray (2.5Y 7/2) gypsiferous sandy clay loam, light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3), moist; 28 percent clay; massive; soft, very friable, moderately sticky, moderately plastic; many fine irregular pores; carbonate, finely disseminated and gypsum, finely disseminated throughout; slightly effervescent, 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and 54 percent gypsum; moderately alkaline, pH 8.3; electrical conductivity 3.1 dS/m (mmhos/cm); very slightly saline; clear smooth boundary.

     Cyy3--17 to 60 inches (43 to 152 cm); light gray (2.5Y 7/1) gypsiferous loamy sand, gray (2.5Y 6/1), moist; 6 percent clay; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many fine irregular pores; carbonate, finely disseminated and gypsum, finely disseminated throughout; slightly effervescent, 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and 75 percent gypsum; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2; electrical conductivity 2.8 dS/m (mmhos/cm); very slightly saline.

Mean annual soil temperature: 66 to 72 degrees F.

Particle-size control section (weighted average) 
Clay content:  5 to 30 percent 
Rock Fragments: Less than 5 percent
Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Torbellino soils are on playa interdunes. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed from gypsiferous eolian deposits and/or gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,890 to 3,930 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Andrecito (NM), Lark (NM), Llano (NM), and Salago (NM) soils. Andrecito soils have a water table and a salic horizon. Lark soils have a sandy particle-size control section. Llano soils have a shallow petrogypsic horizon and a salic horizon, Salago soils have a salic horizon.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, hairy coldenia, and soaptree yucca. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin. MLRA 42, Torbellino is of limited extent.
