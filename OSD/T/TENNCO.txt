TENNCO SERIES

The Tennco series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock.  Tennco soils are on relict basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Tennco fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, under salt desert shrubs and annual grasses and forbs at an elevation of 315 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on December 12, 1988 the soil was dry throughout)

(Combined thickness of the 2C1 and 2C2 horizons is 15 to 35 inches thick)

    2Cknz--45 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/4) loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, carbonates disseminated and segregated as few fine soft masses; very strongly alkaline (pH 10.2).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Halloran, Mazourka (T), and Mobl (T) series.  Halloran soils have 5YR or 7.5YR Btk horizons and gypsum in the lower part of the control section.  Mazourka and Mobl soils have soil temperatures below 47 degrees F. in January and February.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tennco soils are on relict basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock.  Elevations are 290 to 330 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 6 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Kimberlina and Garces soils.   The Kimberlina soils are on adjacent low lying alluvial fans and do not have a natric horizon.  The Garces soils are on similar landforms and are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very slow to slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.  The soils are subject to rare flooding but are protected by dams and levees.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tennco soils are used for native pasture, oilfields, and wildlife habitat.  Reclaimed areas are used for irrigated cropland.  Vegetation is scattered allscale saltbush and mesquite with annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The southern end of the San Joaquin Valley of California.  The soil is not extensive.  MLRA is 17.

SERIES PROPOSED:  Kern County, California, 1989.  The name is coined.

REMARKS:  The electrical conductivity and sodium absorption ratio values mentioned in the range in characteristics section refer to unreclaimed areas of this soil.  Values in reclaimed areas will be lower.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon -- The zone from the soil surface to 1 inch (A).

Natric horizon - The zone from 5 to 13 inches (Btn).
