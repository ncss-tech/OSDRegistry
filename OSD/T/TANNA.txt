TANNA SERIES

The Tanna series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from semiconsolidated shale, mudstone, or siltstone, or in glaciofluvial deposits or alluvium over the bedrock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, strath terraces, escarpments, sedimentary plains, till plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aridic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tanna clay loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, very friable, sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--17 to 27 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse prismatic structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 5 percent channers; continuous distinct lime coating on channers; common fine masses of segregated lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (9 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--27 to 31 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very channery loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; 55 percent channers; continuous distinct lime coating on channers; disseminated lime, few fine masses of lime; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

    Cr--31 to 60 inches; semiconsolidated shale and mudstone interbedded with layers of hard sandstone.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Cascade County, Montana, 1969.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0128.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (after mixing) (Ap and Bt horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 17 inches (Bt horizon); lime accumulation - the zone from 17 inches to the paralithic contact (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons); particle-size control section - the zone from 7 to 17 inches (Bt horizon); paralithic contact - at a depth of 31 inches (Cr horizon).  Tanna soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
