TWINING SERIES

The Twining series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Aqualfic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Twining sandy loam, on a west-facing, concave 2 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 18 cm (7 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; weak medium granular structure; friable; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 23 cm (6 to 9 inches) thick]

 Bs--18 to 33 cm (7 to 13 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy loam; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine distinct spherical brown (10YR 5/3) iron depletions; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 20 cm (5 to 8 inches) thick]

 E--33 to 41 cm (13 to 16 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam; weak medium platy structure; friable; common medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary. [5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches) thick]

 E/B--41 to 51 cm (16 to 20 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam (E) and reddish brown (5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam (B); weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 Bt--51 to 76 cm (20 to 30 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium faint brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; slightly acid. [15 to 51 cm (6 to 20 inches) thick]

 C--76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 inches); light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam; many medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; weak coarse angular blocky structure; firm; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Arenac County, Michigan; 2240 feet west and 300 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 36, T. 18 N., R. 4 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Reaction: strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum
Rock fragment content: 0 to 10 percent throughout

A horizon, where present:
Thickness: 2.5 to 8 cm (1 to 3 inches)
Hue: 10YR
Value: 3
Chroma: 1
Texture: sandy loam or loam

Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 1 to 3
Texture: sandy loam or loam

E horizon above the spodic horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: sandy loam or loam

Bs horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 3 to 6

E horizon below the spodic horizon and the E part of the E/B horizon:

The E part of the E/B horizon is firm and/or platy in some pedons, but lacks the criteria necessary for a fragipan. 

Bt horizon:

Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Twining soils are on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan Age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained or moderately well drained Isabella, McBride, and Montcalm soils are associated with the Twining soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of these soils are used largely for pasture or woodland. A few areas are used for cultivated crops. Corn, small grains, and hay are the principal crops. Woodlands consist of sugar maple, northern red oak, yellow birch, and American basswood.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in northern lower Michigan. The series is of small extent.
