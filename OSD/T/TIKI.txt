TIKI SERIES

The Tiki series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from limestone. Tiki soils are on foothill sideslopes and cliffs and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, mesic Lithic Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Tiki gravelly loam on a 29 percent southeast facing slope - rangeland. (Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 5 cm; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderately fine and very fine granular; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine vesicular pores; 5 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 10 cm thick)

    C1--5 to 15 cm; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure parting to moderately fine and very fine granular; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse and medium, common fine and very fine roots; few medium, fine and very fine tubular pores; 10 percent cobbles and 20 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 15 cm thick)

    C2--15 to 25 cm; reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) very cobbly loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few coarse, medium, fine and very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; 25 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 23 cm thick)

    C3--25 to 36 cm; reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) extremely cobbly loam, red (2.5YR 5/6) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few medium, fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; 45 percent cobbles and 25 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

    R--36 cm; fractured limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Iron County, Utah; about 6 miles west of Parowan in the West Red Hills; northeast quarter of southwest quarter of section 22, T.  34 S., R. 10 W.; USGS Summit 7.5 minute quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 49 minutes 31 seconds N and longitude 112 degrees 58 minutes 10 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil moisture: Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring and for brief periods in late summer due to convection storms aridic bordering on xeric soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 9.0 to 12.0 degrees C.
Depth to lithic contact: 25 to 50 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments: 35 to 70 percent, mostly gravel and cobbles 

A horizon
Hue: 5YR or 2.5YR.
Value: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma: 5 through 8.

C horizons
Hue: 5YR or 2.5YR.
Value: 3 through 5 moist. 
Chroma: 4 through 8.
Texture: Very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely cobbly loam.
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 55 percent (less than 20 mm fraction); 15 to 40 percent (less than 2 mm fraction).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Eaglepass, Izod, Kram, Kyler, Logring  and Zimbob  series. 

Eaglepass, Izod, Kram, Kyler, Logring, and Zimbob soils are all 7.5YR or yellower.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tiki soils occur on foothill sideslopes and cliffs at elevations of 1,600 to 2,670 meters. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in residuum, colluvium and alluvium derived from red limestone. The mean annual temperature is 7.0 to 10.5 degrees C. Average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kinghorn soils. Kinghorn soils have a calcic horizon., and have less than 40 percent carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium or high runoff; moderate permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is dominantly pinyon-juniper, black sage, Mormon tea and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Utah. MLRA 28A These soils are inextensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features that are recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to 18 cm (A, C1 and part of the C2 horizons).
Lithic contact - The contact at 35 cm (R layer).
Particle-size control section - The zone from the surface to 35 cm (A, C1 and C2 horizons).

The classification is based on the "Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006".
