TINEOYLER SERIES

The Tineoyler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, predominantly sandstone.  Tineoyler soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustifluventic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tineoyler loam - farmland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(10 to 32 inches (25 to 81 cm) thick)

    C2--59.5 to 68 inches (151 to 173 cm); reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) loamy fine sand, reddish yellow (5YR 7/6), moist; 4 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; common fine irregular pores; 12 percent gravel; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline, pH 7.6.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Castledale (UT) series.  Castledale soils are in MLRA 34B and include up to 60 percent rock fragments in the substratum, and have colors of 7.5YR and yellower.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tineoyler soils are on stream terraces at elevations of 5425 to 5525 feet (1645 to 1675 m).  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and other sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches (229 to 330 mm) with high intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F (8 to 11 degrees C).  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mulford (UT), Sulphurcreek (UT), and Radnik (UT) series.  Mulford soils are fine-loamy and Sulphurcreek soils contain an argillic horizon.  Radnik soils are fluvents and are on floodplain steps.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, high permeability, rarely or very rarely flooded for very brief periods during the months of July to September.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tineoyler soils are used for irrigated farmland, livestock grazing, and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation includes Fremont cottonwood, rubber rabbitbrush, fourwing saltbush, and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Capitol Reef National Park, Utah; MLRA 35, LRR D. Tineoyler soils are of limited extent.
