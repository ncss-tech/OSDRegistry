TAYLORSFLAT SERIES

The Taylorsflat series consists of very deep, well drained, moderate or moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments from igneous and sedimentary rocks on fan remnants, lake terraces, fan skirts, alluvial flats, and lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Taylorsflat loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 5 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; (pH 8.3); clear, wavy boundary.  (3 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--5 to 20 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 17 inches thick)

    Bk--20 to 33 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silty clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 42 inches thick)

    2C--33 to 72 inches; very pale brown, light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, sticky and plastic; few gypsum flakes and crystals and few fine yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) mottles below depth of 48 inches; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0). (This horizon is composed of lacustrine deposits.)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are Firmage(UT), Komo (T UT), and Potratz (ID) series.  Firmage soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Komo soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Potratz soils formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Taylorsflat soils are on nearly level to undulating fan skirts, alluvial flats, and lake plains at elevations of 4,300 to 6,000 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediment from a wide range of rock formations.  The climate is semiarid.   Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F, and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Birdow, Checkett, Diveno, Harding, Hiko Peak, Mellor, Oasis, Spager and Wales soils.  Checkett and Divino soils have argillic horizons.  Mellor and Harding soils have natric horizons.  Oasis soils are coarse-loamy and lack a calcic horizon.  Hiko Peak soils are gravelly throughout.  Spager soils have a carbonate cemented hardpan.  Birdow soils are loamy throughout and have a thick mollic epipedon.  Wales soils lack a calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; slow to moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as range, irrigated cropland and wildlife habitat.  Natural vegetation is mainly sagebrush, yellowbrush, shadscale, sand dropseed, needleandthread and some juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Utah.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28A and 28B.
