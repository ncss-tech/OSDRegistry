TAGLAKE SERIES

The Taglake series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in non-calcareous glacial till. Taglake soils are on undulating to steep moraines. The average annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Taglake very stony sandy loam - woodland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Oi--0 to 3 cm; forest duff.

     E--3 to 13 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very stony sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 38 cm thick)

     BE--13 to 51 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very stony sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist, with less than 50 percent light gray coatings (A2) on faces of peds; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine and very fine granular; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid (pH 6.2); gradual wavy boundary. (25 to 100 cm thick)

     Bw--51 to 64 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky and slightly plastic; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary. (13 to 50 cm thick)

     BC--64 to 155 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very stony sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, sticky; slightly acid (pH 6.4); gradual wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION: Teton County, Wyoming; near parking lot of Signal Mountain turnoff; NE1/4 of the NW1/4 of sec. 36, T. 45 N., R. 115 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature--2 to 3 degrees C
Texture--sandy loam
Rock fragment content--35 to 50 percent gravel, cobbles and stones

E horizon
Hue--10YR or 7.5YR
Value--6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma--2 or 3
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 6.5

Bw horizon
Hue--10YR or 7.5YR
Value--5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma--3 through 6
Texture--very cobbly sandy loam
Rock fragment content--35 to 50 percent gravel, cobbles and stones
Reaction--pH 5.6 to 6.5

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blackleed, Devore, Garlet, Losee, Nambe, Scout and Umpa series. Blackleed soils lack an E horizon. Devore and Umpa soils have a lithic contact at a depth of less than 100 cm.  Garlet soils have an E/Bw horizon that starts at a depth below 75 cm.  Losee soils have a calcareous C horizon. Nambe and Scout soils lack light gray (E) coatings in the upper part of the Bw horizon. Also, Scout soils have an E horizon thicker than 38 cm and Nambe soils are extremely acid or strongly acid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform--glacial moraines
Elevation--1825 to 2450 meters
Slope--3 to 60 percent
Parent material--glacial till mainly from granite and gneiss
Mean annual precipitation--380 to 760 mm
Mean annual temperature--2 to 3 degrees C

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for recreation and for wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is lodgepole pine, lupine and elk sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Taglake soils are moderately extensive in the hills and valleys of western and southern Wyoming and northern Colorado; MLRAs 43B and 48A
