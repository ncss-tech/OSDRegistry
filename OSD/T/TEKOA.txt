TEKOA SERIES

The Tekoa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains and hills. They formed in loess and metasedimentary residuum and colluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in surface layers. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tekoa soils are on mountain slopes and hills at elevation of 2,000 to 4,000 feet. At higher elevations these soils only occur on south slopes. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. These soils formed in loess and colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks including shale, phyllite, argillite, sandstone, quartzite, and siltstone with an influence of volcanic ash in surface layers. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches including about 3 feet of snow. Average January temperature is 24 degrees F, average July temperature is 66 degrees F, and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 140 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ardenvoir, Schumacher, Libertybutte, and McCrosket soils. Schumacher soils are on west-facing hills, are fine-loamy, and deep to bedrock. Libertybutte soils are on south and west-facing shoulders and summits of mountains and hills, and are shallow to bedrock. Ardenvoir and McCrosket soils are on north and east-facing backslopes of mountains and hills, are loamy-skeletal and are deep to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; moderate permeability; slow to rapid runoff. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Grazing, wildlife, small grains, alfalfa, and grass. Native vegetation is scattered ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, pinegrass, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington and northern Idaho. Series is of moderate extent. MLRAs 43A and 9. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana. 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Spokane County, Washington, 1964. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil include: 
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 14 inches (A1, A2, and BA horizons) 
Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 20 inches (Bt horizon) 
Lithic contact - at 38 inches 
Particle-size control section - the zone from 14 to 20 inches (Bt horizon) 
Vitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons) 

Changes made to description 1/07 using MLRA approach: 
Vegetation revised to reflect a concept of a mesic soil at the transition between MLRA 9 and MLRA 43A. 

Classification updated from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Ultic Argixerolls to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Argixerolls. 
Paralithic contact changed to lithic contact. 
Horizonation updated. 

As of 1/2010, additional investigation is needed across the mapped extent to determine what is typical for vitrandic properties, the type of vegetation, and the shape of rock fragments (whether they are predominantly channers or gravel).
