TOSSUP SERIES

The Tossup series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. These soils are on upper mountain slopes and broad ridges and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1524 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Typic Palexerults

TYPICAL PEDON: Tossup very gravelly loam - under a stand of Douglas-fir and tanoak. When described on August 2, 2004, the soil was dry throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

(Combined thickness of the Bt horizons is 75 to 175 centimeters)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st. This soil has a xeric moisture regime.

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature is 6 degrees C or greater.  This soil has a mesic temperature regime.

Soil reaction: very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil profile.

Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent at 125 centimeters below the top of the argillic horizon.

Surface fragments:  0 to 10 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at this time.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on upper mountain slopes and broad ridges.  They have slopes of 9 to 50 percent at elevations of 19 to 1356 meters (62 to 4449 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and mudstone.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2030 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F)and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F). The mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The frost free period is about 150 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mooncreek and Noisy soils. Mooncreek soils are fine-loamy with less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Noisy soils are loamy-skeletal with greater than 35 percent rock fragment in the particle size control section.  Mooncreek soils are on linear slope positions generally below or alongside Tossup soils.  Noisy soils are on convex slope positions generally below Tossup soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; medium to high runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed. Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone, Cascade barberry, bracken fern and modesty.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The soil is named after Tossup Creek. The series is of small extent.
