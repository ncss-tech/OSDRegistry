TERROR SERIES

The Terror series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium.  Terror soils are found on slopes of 0 to 25 percent on floodplains, terraces, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,000 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic Andic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Terror ashy sandy loam, located on a forested southeast facing valley wall with a slope of 3 percent and an elevation of 1,725 meters.  When described on August 19, 2007 the soil was slightly moist throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Terror soils are found on slopes of 0 to 25 percent on debris aprons, debris cones, and valley walls of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations from 700 to 2,000 meters.  They formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,400 to 2,500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilliwack, Forbidden, and Yawning soils.  Chilliwack soils have a medial fine earth fraction in the upper particle-size control section and have albic and spodic horizons.  Forbidden soils have a sandy-skeletal particle size control section.  Yawning soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and albic and spodic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Moderately well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Terror soils have a water table from endosaturation with an upper limit at 50 cm from the soil surface from November through May and ranging to below 150 cm from June through October.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Terror soils are used for wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed. Native vegetation includes subalpine fir, subalpine larch, Engelmann spruce, mountain hemlock, and occasionally at lower elevations Pacific silver fir and western hemlock.  Understory species include western meadowrue, false hellebore, black huckleberry, prickly currant, Sitka alder, ladyfern and pink mountain heather.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
