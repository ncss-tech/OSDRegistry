TENABO SERIES

The Tenabo series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that are formed in a thin loess mantle high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Tenabo soils are on fan piedmonts and plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Natridurids

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about 6 miles south and west of Beowawe; approximately 1,320 feet west and 700 feet north of the southeast corner of section 13, T. 30 N., R. 49 E.; USGS The Geysers 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 33 minutes 18 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 30 minutes 22 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 40.5550000 latitude, -116.5061111 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and spring, dry late May through November; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 23 to 50 cm.
Other features: In areas subject to recharge with carbonate, effervescence is highly variable above the duripan.  It ranges from noneffervescent at the surface to violently effervescent in the layer above the duripan.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  27 to 35 percent.
Rock fragments: Less than 20 percent, when mixed.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tenabo soils are on fan piedmonts and plateaus. These soils formed in a thin loess mantle high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 1,280 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ricert, Triplen, and Whirlo soils. Ricert soils are fine-loamy and lack a duripan. Triplen soils have durinodes in a friable matrix and have a calcic horizon. Whirlo soils have a cambic horizon and lack durinodes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; very slow, slow or medium runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The vegetation is mainly shadscale, bud sagebrush, cheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada. Tenabo soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 24.
