TADLOCK SERIES

The Tadlock series consists of deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in clayey marine sediments.  They are
on broad upland ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, subactive, thermic Rhodic Paleudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tadlock fine sandy loam on a smooth, convex 1
percent slope, in pines.
                (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
stated.)

     Ap--0 to 5 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) fine sandy
loam; weak medium granular structure; very friable, many fine
roots; medium acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

     B21t--5 to 23 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay; moderate
fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; thin
clay films on faces of most peds; few black coatings on ped faces; few clean sand grains; medium acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (16 to
60 inches thick)

     B22t--23 to 63 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay; moderate
fine subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; thin
clay films on faces of most peds; few clean sand grains; medium
acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (19 to 50 inches thick)

     B23t--63 to 72 inches; dark red (2.5YR 3/6) and red (2.5YR
4/6) clay; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable;
thin clay films on faces of most peds; few clean sand grains; slightly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Dallas County, Alabama; 100 feet east of Alabama Highway 22 and 3.9 miles north of Selma City limits and Northside Baptist Church.  NE1/4NE1/4NW1/4sec. 32, T. 18 N., R. 11 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 72 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.  Many pedons
become more acid with depth.  Few small quartz pebbles occur throughout some pedons.

The Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.

The B2t horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma 4 or
6.  Below 40 inches some pedons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of
4, and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is clay or clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic has more than 30 percent sand and less than
30 percent silt.  The clay content gradually decreases with depth.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or yellow in the lower B2t horizon.  Many pedons have some dark coatings of manganese and
a few iron or manganese concretions in the B2t horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cumberland series in the same
family and the Coronaco, Fayetteville, and Nacogdoches series.  Cumberland soils have more silt and less sand in the upper 20
inches of the argillic horizon.  Coronaco and Nacogdoches soils
have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Fayetteville soils have less than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tadlock soils are on broad upland ridgetops
of the Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The
soils formed in clayey marine sediments.  Average annual air temperature near the type location is 67 degrees F. and the
average annual precipitation is about 51 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bama, Brantley, Greenville, and Lucedale series.  Bama, Greenville, and Lucedale soils have base saturation less than 35 percent.  Also, Bama and Lucedale soils average less than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Brantley soils have sola less
than 60 inches thick and have subsoils with more yellow hue.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for production of cotton, corn, soybeans, truck crops, hay, orchards, and pasture.  Forested areas are mixed pines and hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Dallas, Hale, and Perry Counties in Alabama.  Tadlock soils are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dallas County, Alabama; 1977.

REMARKS:  Tadlock soils were formerly classified in the
Reddish-Brown Lateritic great soil group.  In the past these soils have been included with Greenville and Akron (inactive series)
soils.  Laboratory data is available on the typical pedon (S70Ala24-7-(1-4)) run by Dr. B. F. Hajek of Auburn University.  Also, data is available on two pedons (S61Ala-53-1-(1-6) and S61Ala-53-2-(1-7)) in Perry County, Alabama, run by Lincoln Soil Survey Laboratory.  Data from three horizons from the typical
pedon follows:
