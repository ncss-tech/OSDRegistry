TRINIDAD SERIES

The Trinidad series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from calcareous shale, siltstone, conglomerate and limestone.  The Trinidad soils are on side slopes and crest of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, carbonatic, frigid, shallow Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Trinidad very gravelly silt loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   A--0 to 5 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate very thick platy structure parting to moderate very thin and thin platy; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine, fine and few medium vesicular pores; many carbonate pendants on gravel; 35 percent gravel; 30 percent very fine and fine subangular blocky rock structure; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 cm thick)

  C1--5 to 20 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; many carbonate pendants on gravel; 15 percent gravel; 30 percent very fine and fine subangular blocky rock structure; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

  C2--20 to 33 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) gravelly silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; many carbonate pendants on gravel; 15 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; 30 percent very fine to fine subangular blocky rock structure; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

  Cr--33 to 53 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) soft limestone, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; slightly hard, friable; common very fine and fine roots along weak fractures; violently effervescent.  (15 to 46 cm thick)

   R--53 cm; hard limestone with few very fine roots in fractures; strongly effervescent.

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; approximately 12 miles east of the Gilmer Ranch, about 1,000 feet south of the northeast corner of section 31, T. 44 N., R. 62 E.; USGS Hubbard Basin 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees 40 minute, 01 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 59 minutes 30 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.6669444 latitude, -114.9916667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually moist in winter and spring, dry June through early November; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Organic carbon: Averages l.5 to 2.4 percent throughout the whole soil.
Depth to paralithic contact: 15 to 36 cm.
Depth to hard bedrock; 50 to 76 cm.
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  40 to 80 percent for the less than 20 mm fraction.
Secondary carbonates: Most gravel have carbonate pendants.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 18 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments:  l5 to 35 percent, mostly gravel.

A horizon
Value:  5, 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Structure:  Weak or moderate platy.
Rock structure:  0 to 40 percent.

C horizon
Value:  5, 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 or 6 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Weak to moderate subangular blocky or is massive.
Rock structure:  0 to 40 percent.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Trinidad soils are on crests and side slopes of hills.  These soils formed in residuum derived from calcareous shale, siltstone, conglomerate and limestone.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,200 mm.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dirk, Shalcleav, Shalper and Soughe series.  Dirk soils are deep, have a loamy- skeletal particle-size control section and lack carbonatic minerology.  Shalcleav, Shalper and Soughe soils lack a paralithic contact, have mixed minerology with more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, cheatgrass and miscellaneous forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.
