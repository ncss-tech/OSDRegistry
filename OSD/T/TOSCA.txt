TOSCA SERIES

The Tosca series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from sandstone and shale. Tosca soils are on mountain back slopes, sideslopes, and shoulders with slopes ranging from 20 to 80 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Calciustolls

TYPE LOCATION:  Grand County, Utah; about 40 miles southwest of Bonanza, 1,700 feet east and 2,000 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 34, T. 15 1/2 S., R. 24 E SLBM; P R Springs, Utah USGS quadrangle; 39 degrees, 27 minutes, 38 seconds north latitude and 109 degrees, 15 minutes, 10 seconds west longitude. NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depths are measured from the top of the mineral soil surface.

Soil moisture: It is moist in all parts of the moisture control section 40 to 45 percent of the time the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is usually moist in some part during late spring to early fall, and intermittently dry in late fall; typic ustic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature:  40 to 45 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature:  61 to 65 degrees F.
Depth to calcic horizon:  7 to 15 inches
Depth to lithic contact:  40 to 60 inches to sandstone bedrock
Some pedons have a lithologic discontinuity at 14 to 51 inches 
Mollic epipedon:  7 to 15 inches thick

Particle-size control section:  10 to 18 percent clay and 35 to 65 percent rock fragments

A horizon:

The Bw horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Bk horizons.  It is too thin for a cambic horizon.

The 2C horizon, where present, has colors similar to the C horizons.

COMPETING SERIES:  Current competitors are the Bigsheep, Eager, Saddlehorse and Winspect series.

Bigsheep, Winspect and Saddlehorse soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the control section.
Bigsheep, Eager and Winspect soils are very deep.
Saddlehorse soils have a paralithic contact with shale at 20 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and shale
Landform:  backslopes of mountains
Elevation:  6,500 to 9,400 feet
Slope:  20 to 80 percent
Mean annual temperature:  38 to 46 degrees F.
Average annual precipitation:  16 to 22 inches
Precipitation Pattern:  Wettest months are May to Ootober and driest months are February to April.Mean annual temperature:  38 to 46 degrees F.
Freeze-free period:  60 to 90 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Utso, Sowcan, Pathead, Seeprid, and Veatch soils.  Sowcan, Seeprid and Utso soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 16 inches.  Pathead and Veatch soils are 20 to 40 inches deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium and high runoff, moderately rapid or moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for rangeland, recreation and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, Utah serviceberry, birchleaf mountainmahogany, antelope bitterbrush and Gambel oak.  This soil has been correlated to the Mountain Very Steep Stony Loam 048AY473UT range site at the type location in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern and central Utah and northwestern Colorado.  The series is of moderate extent.
