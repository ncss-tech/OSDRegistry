TRIANE SERIES

The Triane series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in eolian material over local slope alluvium derived from shale.  They formed on playa rims with slopes of 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - The soil moisture control section is intermittently moist in some part from July to October and December to March.  It is assumed to be dry in all parts for less than 75 percent of the time (cumulative), when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or higher.  The soils are driest in May and June.  The soil moisture regime is ustic aridic.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no competing series.  A similar soil in another family is the  Galisteo (NM) series. Galisteo soils have a superactive activity class. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Triane soils are on rims of playa.  They formed in eolian material over local slope alluvium derived from Triassic age shale.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kwahe and Stanley soils.  Kwahe soils are fine, do not have cambic horizons, and occur on playa steps.  Stanley soils are very-fine, do not have cambic horizons, and occur on playa floors.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderate surface runoff; permeability is very slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Triane soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Present vegetation is fourwing saltbush and alkali sacaton.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Triane soils are of small extent on the northeastern Estancia Basin part of the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and Range physiographic province in northcentral New Mexico. The MLRA is 70C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

SERIES PROPOSED: Santa Fe County, New Mexico; Santa Fe Area Soil Survey Update; 2002. Triane is a coined name. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - surface to a depth of about 4 inches. (A horizons)
Cambic horizon - 4 to about 14 inches. (Bt horizon)
Particle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 14 inches. (Bt horizon)

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.

Note: Although the Bt horizon appears to have clay films, lab data does not support criterion 2.c. of the required characteristics for an argillic horizon.

ADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location has been sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S-NM-02-049-010; Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a field calcimeter.
