TABYAGO SERIES

The Tabyago series consists of moderately deep to interbedded sandstone and shale, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Tabyago soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Aridic Calciustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tabyago loam, on a northwest facing, convex, 2 percent slope in Wyoming big sagebrush rangeland at an elevation of 6,800 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    The surface is covered by 10 percent subangular gravel derived from sandstone and shale.

    A--0 to 3 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate very thin and thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; very slightly effervescent, (4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 11 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very channery loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 30 percent channers, 10 percent gravel; slightly effervescent, (8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (9 to 11 inches thick)

    Bk--11 to 16 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very channery sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate very thin and thin platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 40 percent channers; strongly effervescent, (14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated in few irregular shaped very fine soft masses and coatings on rock fragments less than 1 mm thick; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.

    Bky--16 to 24 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/3) very channery sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grained; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; 45 percent channers; few very fine soft masses of gypsum; strongly effervescent, (7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent), carbonates are disseminated and segregated in coatings on rock fragments less than 1 mm thick; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).  (combined thickness of the Bk horizon is 9 to 24 inches)

    R--24 inches; hard fractured sandstone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Uintah County, Utah; about 3 miles southwest of Dog Knoll; located about 1,800 feet north and 500 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 24, T. 13 S., R. 18 E., SLBM; Dog Knoll USGS quad; lat. 39 degrees 40 minutes 12 seconds N. and long. 109 degrees 50 minutes 37 seconds W., NAD 27

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture :  The moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year with a slight increase in late summer and early fall.  Ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature:  44 to 47 degrees F.
Surface rock fragments:  0 to 20 percent subangular gravel and channers
Depth to lithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to sandstone or shale
Depth to calcic horizon:  11 to 17 inches

Particle-size control section:  8 to 18 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments - predominantly channers, gravel, and some flagstones

A horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4

Bw horizon:
Hue:  7.5YR or 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4
Texture:  very channery loam or very channery sandy loam
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent

Bk and Bky horizons:
Value:  6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist
Chroma:  2 to 4
Texture:  very channery sandy loam and very channery loam
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent
Gypsum:  0 to 5 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline 

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no current competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  eolian deposits over residuum derived from sandstone and shale.
Landform:  plateaus
Slopes:  2 to 4 percent
Elevation: 6,700 to 7,300 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  42 to 45 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  12 to 16 inches.
Frost-free period:  90 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Castner, Cedarknoll, Gompers, Pathead, Whetrock, and Whitesage series.  

Castner and Gompers soils are shallow, and Castner soils have mollic epipedons.

Cedarknoll soils occur on fan remnants are shallow and have carbonatic mineralogy.

Pathead soils do not have calcic horizons.

Whetrock soils have mollic epipedons.

Whitesage soils occur on fan remnants, have a fine-loamy pscs, and are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, low runoff, moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Potential plant community consists of Wyoming big sagebrush, needleandthread, Indian ricegrass, antelope bitterbrush, and muttongrass.  These soils have been correlated to Upland Stony Loam (Wyoming Big Sagebrush) - 034XY334UT range sites in Utah.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Utah.  LRR D, MLRA 34.  This series is of small extent.
