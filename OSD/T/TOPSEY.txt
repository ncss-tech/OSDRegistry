TOPSEY SERIES

The Topsey series consists of moderately deep over densic bedrock, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed from marly claystone and siltstone of the Walnut Clay Formation. These soils occur on very gently sloping to moderately sloping side slopes of ridges on hills. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in), and mean annual air temperature is 19.4 degrees C (66 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, carbonatic, thermic Udic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Topsey clay loam, on a concave 3 percent slope at about 257 m (845 ft) in elevation in rangeland.

Maloterre and Pidcoke soils: have a lithic contact within 50 cm (20 in). They occur on convex ridgetops above Topsey soils.
Nuff soils: have a fine-silty particle-size control section and occur on positions lower than Topsey soils.
Slidell soils: have smectitic mineralogy and occur on footslopes and toeslopes below Topsey soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is medium on slopes from 1 to 5 percent and high on slopes from 5 to 8 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly range, but some areas are used for pasture. Native vegetation is a mid and tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Texas; LRR J, MLRA 85. This series is of moderate extent.
