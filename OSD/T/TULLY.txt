TULLY SERIES

The Tully series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in  colluvium.  Tully soils are on footslopes of hillslopes of uplands in Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 millimeters (35 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clime, Florence, Ivan, Kipson, Reading, and Sogn Soils.  
Clime, Florence, Kipson, and Sogn soils are formed in residuum on steeper slopes adjacent to Tully soils.

Kipson soils is shallow over shale.  
Sogn soils are shallow over limestone.  
Florence soils are clayey-skeletal and are deep over limestone. 
Ivan and Reading are fine-silty soils on flood plains below the Tully soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: medium to very high.  
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: low

USE AND VEGETATION:  The larger, less sloping areas are mostly cultivated.
Wheat, sorghum, alfalfa, and corn are the principal crops.  
The smaller and steeper areas are mostly used as rangeland.  
Native vegetation is tall-grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central to east-central Kansas; Land Resource Region H, Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range region; MLRA 76 Bluestem Hills.  The series is extensive; about 300,000 acres.
