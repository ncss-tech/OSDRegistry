TENNECO SERIES

The series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed fan alluvium.  Tenneco soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON: Tenneco fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 2 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular pores; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 11 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular and tubular pores; common distinct organic coatings on ped faces; noneffervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (6 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk1--11 to 26 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular and tubular pores; many fine calcium carbonate filaments; strongly effervescent, 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

    Bk2--26 to 41 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few fine irregular and tubular pores; many fine calcium carbonate filaments; violently effervescent, 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth boundary.

    C--41 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine irregular pores; disseminated calcium carbonate; violently effervescent, 7 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).  (Combined thickness of the Bk and C horizons is 40 to 50 inches)

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Double (NM), Hooks (AZ), and LaLande (NM) series. Double soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 59 to 62 degrees F. Hooks soils are noneffervescent throughout. LaLande soils are in the Great Plains and are moist in the soil moisture control section in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tenneco soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans at elevations of 2,900 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in mixed fan alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 250 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sasabe, Vana, Moco, Courtland and Diaspar.  The Sasabe, Courtland and Diaspar soils have argillic horizons.  Vana soils have a petrocalcic horizon.  Moco soils have gypsic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability.  Subject to flooding.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes Lehmann lovegrass, blue grama, vine mesquite, cane beardgrass, tobosa, and mesquite.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona and West Texas. MLRAs 41 and 42. Tenneco soils are of moderate extent.
