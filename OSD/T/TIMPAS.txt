TIMPAS SERIES

The Timpas series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium. Timpas soils areon paleoterraces and strath terraces. The surface horizon formed in clayey alluvium from sediment-rich irrigation water. The subsoil and substratum formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary materials over residuum weathered from limestone, chalk, and marl. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F.).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:
Series control section: 0 to 150 centimeters (0 to 59 inches)
Particle size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches).

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

LAN 3/2013 This soil was previously described as a limestone bedrock phase of the Rocky Ford series. This phase is outside the range of characteristics and series control section of the Rocky Ford series.
