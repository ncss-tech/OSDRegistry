TEXLA SERIES

The Texla series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils. These soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation of late Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 inches).

Aldine soils: have a fine-silty over clayey particle-size control section
Crystal Lake, Gichigami, Kneff, Littlefork, Ribriver, and Spencer soils: are in a frigid temperature regime
Gist soils: have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section
Immanuel and Scotlandville soils: have mixed mineralogy
Kleinpeter: in a hyperthermic temperature regime
Vidrine soils: have a coarse-silty over clayey particle-size control section and typically have carbonates in the lower part of the solum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of late Pleistocene age
Landscape: flat Coastal Plains
Landform: flats
Microfeature: relict bars 
Slope: 0 to 2 percent 
Mean annual precipitation range: 1219 to 1524 mm (48 to 60 in) 
Precipitation Pattern: Precipitation is fairly uniform throughout the year with slight peaks in the spring and fall months. 
Mean annual air temperature range: 19.5 to 20.6 degrees C (67 to 69 degrees F.) 
Frost-free period: 240 to 300 days 
Elevation: 4.6 to 30.5 m (15 to 100 ft) 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  
These are the Camptown(TX), Evadale (TX),Gist (TX), and the tentative Vidor (T) series. 
Camptown soils: have aquic conditions; in relict meanderbelt channels 
Evadale soils: have aquic conditions; on flats  
Gist soils: have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section; oval pimple mounds
Vidor soils: have exchangeable sodium percentages greater than 15; on flats

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is high on slope less than 1 percent and very high on slope greater than 1 percent. Permeability is very slow. These soils are saturated for more than 30 days from 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in) below the soil surface during late winter and early spring. Redoximorphic features are due to abnormally wet conditions.  
 
USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for woodland and native pasture.  Most areas are in pine and hardwood, mainly loblolly pine, water oak, and sweetgum.  The understory vegetation is mainly yaupon and American beautyberry with andropogon, paspalum, and panicum species with a few sedges.  A few areas have been cleared and used for improved pastures of bahiagrass and bermudagrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B) of Texas. The series extends from the Sabine River to Trinity River. The series is of moderate extent.
