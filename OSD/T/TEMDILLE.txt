TEMDILLE SERIES

The Temdille series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium.  Temdille soils are on alluvial fans and bajadas in intermontane basins.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy-skeletal, mixed Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Temdille sandy loam - on a 2 percent slope in an area of rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) Described on July 28, 1988.

    A--0 to 6 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

    AC--6 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly loamy coarse sand, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 30 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 20 inches thick)

    C1--10 to 17 inches;  brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 50 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 50 inches thick)

    C2--17 to 33 inches; reddish yellow(7.5YR 6/6) gravelly coarse sand, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 25 percent gravel, 2 percent cobbles, 1 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 45 inches thick)

    C3--33 to 51 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 45 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); abrupt smooth boundary.

    C4--51 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very gravelly coarse sand, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) moist; single grain; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 45 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Park County, Colorado; about 16 miles east of Hartsel, about 2,400 feet north and 100 feet west of the southeast corner of Sec. 8, T. 12 S., R. 73 W.; Glentivar USGS quad; latitude 39 degrees, 1 minute, 19 seconds N.; longitude 105 degrees, 34 minutes, 30 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is usually dry in late spring and early summer, moist in some part in late July and August, and intermittently dry in fall; ustic regime bordering on aridic.
Mean annual soil temperature: 37 to 41 degrees F.
Mean summer soil temperature: 51 to 58 degrees F.
Thickness of mollic epipedon: 7 to 15 inches
Sands are angular to subrounded and include a high proportion of quartzite and micas

Particle-size control section (weighted average):
Clay content: 5 to 8 percent
Rock fragment content: 35 to 45 percent

A horizon
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR
Value:  4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry; 2 or 3 moist
Clay content: 10 to 18 percent
Gravel content: 5 to 14 percent
Organic matter content: 2.0 to 4.0 percent

AC horizon
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR
Value:  4 to 6 dry; 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4 dry; 2 to 4 moist 
Texture: gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy coarse sand
Clay content: 5 to 19 percent
Gravel content: 15 to 35 percent

C horizons
Hue: 10YR, 7.5YR 
Value: 5 to 7 dry; 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6 dry; 3 to 6 moist
Texture: very gravelly coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand
Clay content: 1 to 8 percent
Fragment size and content: 15 to 60 percent indurated gravel; 0 to 3 percent indurated cobbles; 0 to 1 percent indurated stones
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline (pH 6.6 to 7.8)

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bearmouth, Pierian, and Tine series.
The Bearmouth and Tine soils have a lithologic discontinuity, and do not border an aridic moisture regime.
The Pierian soils have greater than 1 percent stones, and do not border an aridic moisture regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: alluvium derived from mixed sources
Landform: alluvial fans, bajadas
Slopes: 1 to 12 percent
Elevation: 8,700 to 9,800 feet
Mean annual temperature: 35 to 39 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 10 to 14 inches
Precipitation pattern: Monthly precipitation is lowest in winter and greatest in July and August. 
Frost-free period: 50 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gebson and Levenmile soils.  These soils have a lower gravel content, and the fine-earth fraction of the substratum averages sandy loam or finer.  The Gebson soils have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation consists of Arizona fescue, slimstem muhly, prairie junegrass, blue grama, bottlebrush squirreltail, needleandthread, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Intermontane basins and valleys of Central Colorado; LRR E, MLRA 48B.  The series is of moderate extent.
