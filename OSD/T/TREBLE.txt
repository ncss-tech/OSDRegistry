TREBLE SERIES

The Treble series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, foothills and escarpments. They formed in till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 660 mm and, mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Vitrandic Haploxerepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Treble gravelly ashy sandy loam, forested; on a south-facing slope of 30 percent at 765 meters elevation. When described on August 22, 1972, the soil was dry throughout. Pedon was redescribed on July 29, 1996. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Landform: mountain slopes, foothills, escarpments
Elevation: 550 to 1160 meters
Slope: 5 to 65 percent
Parent material: till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash
Mean annual precipitation: 600 to 1,150 mm
Mean annual air temperature: 5.6 to 7.8 degrees C
Frost free period: 80 to 130 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bonner, Dufort, Idamont, Kriest, and Pend Oreille soils. Bonner soils are on outwash terraces and have a thick volcanic ash mantle on the surface. Dufort, Idamont, and Pend Oreille soils are on foothills and mountains and contain more volcanic ash in the surface layers. Kriest soils are on mountains and have weathered bedrock at 100 to 150 cm.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; runoff is medium to very rapid; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, grazing, wildlife habitat, recreation and watershed. A few areas are used for home-sites. Natural vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and lodgepole pine with an understory of mallow ninebark, creambush oceanspray, white spirea, Saskatoon serviceberry, largeleaf sandwort, heartleaf arnica, woods rose, pine reedgrass, Columbia brome, common snowberry, strawberry, and elk sedge. The natural vegetation on the high precipitation phase is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, western white pine, and ponderosa pine with an understory of myrtle pachystima, baldhip rose, common snowberry, longtube twinflower, American trailplant, piper anemone, goldthread, elk sedge, pine reedgrass, and starry false Solomons seal.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, and possibly northeastern Washington. The series is moderately extensive. MLRAs -- 43A, 44A.
