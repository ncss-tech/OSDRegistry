TERRY SERIES

The Terry series consists of moderately deep to calcareous sandstone, well drained soils that formed in parent sediments weathered residually from underlying soft sandstone.  Terry soils are on hills and ridges and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 36 centimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Terry fine sandy loam in grassland (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  A--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, very friable; few scattered sandstone fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6 inches) thick)

  Bt--13 to 36 centimeters (5 to 14 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, very friable; common thin glossy patches on faces of peds, glossy coatings on inside of root channels and coating sand grains, wax-like bridges between sand grains; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 48 centimeters (7 to 19 inches) thick)

  BCk--36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches); light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable; few glossy patches on faces of peds, some glossy coatings on sand grains; calcium carbonate occurring as small concretions; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual smooth bounary.  (10 to 13 centimeters (4 to 5 inches) thick)

  Ck--46 to 66 centimeters (18 to 26 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) fine sandy loam, grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable; some visible calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (13 to 25 centimeters (5 to 10 inches) thick)

  Cr--66 centimeters (26 inches); weakly indurated, calcareous sandstone containing some thin discontinuous hard ledges of sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  Weld County, Colorado; 0.3 kilometers (0.2 mile) north and 73 meters (240 feet) east of the southwest corner of sec. 23, T. 7 N., R. 62 W.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Betonnie, Bijou, Terro, Tintero and Vonalee series. 
Betonnie soils do not have lithic contacts at 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) 
Bijou soils lack a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 102 centimeters (40 inches) and noncalcareous throughout.
Terro soils formed in residuum, alluvium and colluvium.
Tintero soils typically have redder hues.
Vonalee soils formed in coarse and moderately coarse alluvium or eolian deposits derived largely from calcareous sandstone.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: on hills, smooth plains, and ridges
Parent material: sediments weathered residually from soft sandstone
Slopes: 1 to 30 percent
Average annual precipitation: 36 centimeters (14 inches), 20 centimeters (8 inches) of which falls during the period of April through September
Average annual temperature: 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.)
Average summer temperature: 21 degrees C. (70 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Otero and Vona soils.  
Otero soils lack a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 40 inches and have no argillic horizon.  
Vona soils occur in some landscapes in a topograhic sequence with Terry soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage: well drained
Runoff; low
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: high

USE AND VEGETATION:  In dry farm areas, the soils are used for production of native pasture, wheat, millet, corn, and sorghum.  
Under irrigation, alfalfa, small grains, corn, potatoes, and sugar beets are grown.  
Native vegetation is sand reedgrass, little bluestem, sand bluestem, needleandthread grass, sand dropseed, blue grama, wild buckwheat, cactus, and yucca.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Colorado and Wyoming and southern Montana.  The series is moderately extensive.
