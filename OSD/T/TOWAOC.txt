TOWAOC SERIES

The Towaoc series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from diorite and other intrusive igneous material.  Towaoc soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 6 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 79 inches.
Particle-size control section: The zone from 11 to 40 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 5 inches.  (A1, A2 horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 12 to 32 inches.  (Bt1, and part of the Bt2 horizons)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
