TUCUPIT SERIES

The Tucupit series consists of deep and very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Tucupit soils are on canyon sides and escarpments.  Slopes range from 20 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 381 millimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Aridic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tucupit , on a south facing 62 percent slope at an elevation of 1752 meters (5782 feet).  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  

     A--0 to 1.5 inches (0 to 4 cm); yellowish red (5YR 5/6) very gravelly loamy fine sand, 5YR 3/6 (5YR 3/6), moist; 3 percent clay; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; many very fine roots and common fine roots; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobble; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 6.6.

     BC--1.5 to 12.5 inches (4 to 32 cm); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) very cobbly loamy fine sand, dark red (2.5YR 3/6), moist; 3 percent clay; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; common medium roots and common very fine roots and common fine roots; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobble and 5 percent stone; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 6.6.

     C--12.5 to 59 inches (32 to 150 cm); red (2.5YR 4/6) very cobbly loamy fine sand, dark red (2.5YR 3/6), moist; 2 percent clay; single grain; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; common fine roots; 20 percent gravel and 15 percent cobble and 10 percent stone; noneffervescent; neutral, pH 6.6.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bamac (NM), Barkerville (AZ), and Schamber (SD) series.   Bamac soils have yellow hues and effervescent soils. Barkerville soils are moderately deep to granite bedrock. Schamber soils have yellow hues, visible carbonate accumulations.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone
Landform:  canyons and escarpments
Slopes:  20 to 75 percent
Elevation:  5200 to 6500 feet
Mean annual temperature:  7.2 to 10.6 degrees C
Mean annual precipitation:  350 to 406 millimeters
Precipitation pattern: May and June are the driest, January to March are the wettest, and monsoonal storms in late summer.
Frost-free period:  120 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Metuck series.  The Metuck soils and are on canyon side backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  somewhat excessively drained, high runoff, rapid permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tucupit soils are used for wildlife habitat, aesthetics, recreation. Vegetation includes Utah juniper, big sagebrush, gambel oak, yucca, indian ricegrass, cheatgrass, ash, ponderosa pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Utah; LRR D, MLRA 35; Tucupit soils are of limited extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES PROPOSED:   Zion National Park, Utah, soil survey area, 2017.

Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 centimeters.

Remarks:  The name Tucupit comes from Tucupit Point in Zion National Park where the typical pedon is located on the slopes just below.
