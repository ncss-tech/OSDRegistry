TABERNASH SERIES

The Tabernash series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified but predominantly fine textured alluvium or lacustrine deposits overlying sand and gravel.  Tabernash soils are on glacial lake and stream terraces or alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 32 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Inceptic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Tabernash gravelly loam - forest.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    01--1 to 1/2 inch; pine needles and twigs.

    02--1/2 inch to 0; partially decomposed organic matter.

    A1--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/2) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; soft, very friable, 20 percent pebbles; medium acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 3 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 8 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, 20 percent pebbles; medium acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    A&B--8 to 10 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly sandy clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate fine granular structure; hard, firm; horizon is dominantly A2 material which surrounds irregular inclusions of B material; 20 percent pebbles; medium acid; clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    B2t--10 to 22 inches; yellowish red (5YR 5/6) gravelly clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm; common thin clay films on peds; 20 percent pebbles; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 30 inches thick)

    IIC--22 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) gravelly coarse sand, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; single grained; 35 percent pebbles; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Gunnison County, Colorado; along a trail extending north from the Pieplant cow camp; SE 4 Sec. 20, T. 13 S., R. 82 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to the contrasting IIC horizon range from 20 to 38 inches.  Rock fragments are less than 25 percent in most of the solum but range from 25 to 70 percent in the IIC horizon.  Rock fragments are mainly pebbles and cobbles.  The solum is medium acid or slightly acid.

The A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 .

The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically clay loam, but clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 50 percent, and sand from 20 to 50 percent.  Transitional B3 horizons less than 5 inches thick are in some pedons.

The IIC horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  It is medium acid through neutral.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mathers and Tellman series. Mathers soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the solum, most of which are fine and very fine angular granite fragments, and have extremely hard consistence when dry.  Tellman soils are very strongly acid or strongly acid.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tabernash soils are on glacial lake and stream terraces or alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in stratified but predominantly fine textured slightly acid to neutral mixed alluvium or lacustrine deposits overlying sand and gravel.   At the type location the average annual precipitation is 25 inches.  The average annual temperature is 32 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 50 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mine and Tex soils. Mine soils lack an argillic horizon.  Tex soils have a coarse-loamy control section and the argillic horizon is comprised of lamellae.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to slow runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for grazing, for recreational purposes, and forestry.  Principal vegetation is lodgepole pine, spruce, fir, vaccinium, and kinnikinnik.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountainous areas of central Colorado. The series is believed to be of moderate extent but only approximately 3,000 acres have been mapped.
