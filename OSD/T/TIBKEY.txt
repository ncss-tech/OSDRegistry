TIBKEY SERIES 

The Tibkey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or alpine till derived from fine grained igneous or metamorphic rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, drainageways and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Fluvaquentic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tibkey mucky silt loam, bouldery, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A2--2 to 8 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) mucky silt loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; strong medium prismatic structure parting to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 10 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of A1, A2 horizons - 2 to 10 inches). 

    Bw1--8 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; slightly hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. 

    Bw2--13 to 25 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual wavy boundary. 

    Bw3--25 to 32 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8); gradual irregular boundary. (combined thickness of Bw1, Bw2, Bw3 horizons - 10 to 40 inches)

    BC--32 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - alluvial fans, drainageways and mountain slopes 
Elevation - 5,500 to 7,500 feet
Slope - 1 to 15 percent
Parent material - alluvium, colluvium or alpine till derived from fine grained igneous or metamorphic rocks
Climate - long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 24 inches
Mean annual air temperature - 36 to 40 degrees F. 
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Foolhen, Marcel, and Sebud soils. Foolhen soils are very poorly drained and fine-loamy on floodplains. Marcel soils have an argillic horizon and are on alluvial fans and mountain slopes. Sebud soils are well drained and are on alluvial fans and mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Tibkey soils are primarily used for rangeland, wildlife habitat and watershed.  The potential native vegetation is mainly  rough fescue, Idaho fescue, tufted hairgrass, sedges, lupine, iris, ballhead sandwort, shrubby cinquefoil, alder and willows. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Tibkey soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana. MLRA - 43B.
