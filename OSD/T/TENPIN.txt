TENPIN SERIES

The Tenpin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and pyroclastic rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lyon County, Nevada; about 1,360 feet south and 640 feet west of the northeast corner of section 6, T. 7 N., R. 25 E.; USGS Sweetwater Creek 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 29 minutes and 53 seconds N and longitude 119 degrees 13 minutes and 27 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.4980556 latitude, -119.2241667 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter, spring and early summer; dry from midsummer through fall; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 9 degrees C.
Base of the argillic horizon :76 to 100 cm.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly acid throughout.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  35 to 45 percent.
Rock fragments:  60 to 75 percent, mainly cobbles and stones.

A horizons
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Other features:  The surface 18 cm mixed, have value greater than 5.5 dry.

Bt horizons
Hue:  7.5YR or l0YR.
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 and 4.
Structure:  Angular and subangular blocky.
Texture:  Sandy clay, or clay with a sand fraction of more than 40 percent.

C horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Texture:  Sandy loam or loam, commonly with 60 to 75 percent rock fragments, mainly cobbles and stones.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Cant series. Cant soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tenpin soils are on convex alluvial fans and remnants of dissected fans.  Slopes are commonly 4 to 8 percent but range up to 15 percent on dissected side slopes.  Elevations are 1,950 to 2,320 meters.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic and pyroclastic rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C and the mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm.  Frost-free season is 80 to l00 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Shree and Veta soils.  Shree soils have a mollic epipedon and less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Veta soils lack an argillic horizon and are very gravelly sandy loam throughout.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Tenpin soils are used for livestock grazing.  Native vegetation is low sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western Nevada.  The soils are not extensive.
