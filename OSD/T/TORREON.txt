TORREON SERIES

The Torreon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium from basalt that is slightly modified by eolian sediments. Torreon soils are on basalt mesas, lava plateaus, and fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F.. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, mesic Calcidic Argiustolls

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Union County, New Mexico, 1972.

REMARKS: This update changes the classification from Aridic Argiustolls to Torrertic Argiustolls based on laboratory data from Las Animas County, Colorado. This update also moves the type location to Colfax County, New Mexico and is representative of northeastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon: 0 to 11 inches. (A and AB horizons)
Argillic horizon: 11 to 36 inches. (Bt and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon: 36 to 60 inches thick. (BCk horizon)
Torrertic feature: Linear extensibility exceeds 6.0 cm between the mineral soil surface and 100 cm.
