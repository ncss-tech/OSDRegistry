TARRANT SERIES

The Tarrant series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to indurated limestone bedrock, interbedded with marl and chalk. These well drained soils formed in residuum derived from limestone of Cretaceous age. These nearly level to very steep soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, thermic Lithic Calciustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tarrant cobbly clay--native pasture.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no series currently in the same family. Similar soils are Aledo, Altuda, Eckrant, Ector, Oplin, Prade, and Purves.
Aledo, Altuda, Ector and Oplin soils: Have less than 35 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction and have carbonatic mineralogy. 
Eckrant soils: Do not have a calcic horizon. 
Prade soils: Have a petrocalcic horizon and paralithic bedrock. 
Purves soils: Have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: Residuum derived from limestone of Lower Cretaceous age, including interbedded chalk and marl.
Landscape: Dissected plateaus
Landform: Summits, shoulders, and backslopes of hills and ridges 
Slope: 1 to 50 percent, but is commonly 1 to 8 percent
Precipitation Pattern: The majority of the yearly rainfall occurs during the fall and spring months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May. June through August and December through February are the driest months.
Mean annual precipitation: 508 to 813 mm (20 to 32 in)
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 30 to 44
Mean annual air temperature: 16.7 to 21.1 degrees C (62 to 70 degrees F)
Frost free period: 210 to 260 days
Elevation: 304.8 to 823.0 m (1,000 to 2,700 ft)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Brackett, Campwood, Eckrant, Kavett, and Valera series.
Brackett soils: Have paralithic bedrock, less than 35 percent coarse fragments, and occur on backslope positions. 
Campwood soils: Are very deep alluvial soils on stream terraces.
Eckrant soils: Occur on similar landform positions. 
Kavett soils: Have a petrocalcic horizon, less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section, and occur on similar landform positions.
Real soils: Have paralithic bedrock, less than 35 percent clay content in the particle-size control section, and occur on similar landform positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained.  Permeability is moderately slow. Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes, medium on 1 to 5 percent slopes, high on 5 to 20 percent slopes and very high on 20 to 50 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly rangeland and wildlife habitat. The climax plant community is a tall grass savannah with motts of live oak throughout the landscape. The dominant grasses are little bluestem and sideoats grama.  Other grasses include yellow Indiangrass, fall witchgrass, wildrye, green sprangletop, meadow dropseed, cane and pinhole bluestem, hairy grama, Texas wintergrass, curly mesquite and buffalograss. Woody plants include live oak, shin oak, evergreen sumac, hackberry, elbowbush, redbud, and white honeysuckle. Forbs, such as orange zexmenia, Engelmann daisy, bundleflower, snout bean, and bushsunflower, are present.  With continued over grazing, the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population sideoats grama, buffalograss, hairy grama, dropseeds, and the woody plants. If this destructive grazing practice continues, the site will deteriorate to a plant population of Ashe juniper, Texas persimmon, live oak, Texas grama, hairy tridens, curly mesquite, threeawns, prairie coneflower, and broomweed.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED: McLennan County, Texas; 1947.

REMARKS: The province of occurrence for the Tarrant series was redefined in 1997.  Tarrant soils are now limited to the Edwards Plateau materials with a P-E index of 30 to 44.
The calcic horizon in the typical pedon is questionable and this series needs to be studied over its full extent and a new typical pedon selected.

Edited 10/2016 (RFG-THW): Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in)
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (A and Ak horizons) 
Calcic horizon: 20 to 33 cm (8 to 13 in) (Ak horizon and the upper few inches of limestone bedrock)
Lithic contact: 33 cm (13 in) (top of R layer)

ADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples from Menard County, TX327, Texas, sampled by SSL, Lincoln, NE, 10/64, include Lab pedon numbers 40A4526 and 40A4527. Sample 40A4527 is the OSD type location.
