TOOGOOD SERIES

The Toogood series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sand and gravel deposits. These soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic Arenic Eutrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Toogood loamy sand, on an area of 1 to 6 percent slopes. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 10 cm (4 inches); black (10YR 2/1) loamy sand, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; about 1 percent gravel; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary. [5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches) thick]

 Bw1--10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loamy sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; about 1 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. [2.5 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick]

 Bw2--20 to 86 cm (8 to 34 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loamy sand; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common medium and coarse roots and few fine roots; about 10 percent gravel and cobbles; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [23 to 76 cm (9 to 30 inches) thick]

 2Bt--86 to 91 cm (34 to 36 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) gravelly sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; common faint clay bridges between sand grains; about 30 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear irregular boundary. [2.5 to 5 cm (1 or 2 inches) thick

 3C--91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sand; single grain; loose; about 50 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Newaygo County, Michigan; about 4 miles north and 9 miles east of Newaygo; 1,950 feet north and 500 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 27, T. 13 N., R. 11 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches)
Depth to carbonates: 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches)
Rock fragment content: 1 to 30 percent gravel in the solum
Particle-size control section: averages from 5 to 15 percent rock fragments

Ap horizon, where present:
Value: 3 or 4, 6 dry
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: commonly loamy sand, but the range includes sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

A horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: commonly loamy sand, but the range includes sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

Bw horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 to 6
Texture: sand, loamy sand, gravelly sand, or gravelly loamy sand
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

2Bt horizon:
Thickness: less than 8 cm (3 inches)
 Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 4 or 6
Reaction: strongly acid to neutral

3C horizon:
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Texture: gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sand, gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly loamy sand 
Rock fragment content: 15 to 55 percent gravel

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Toogood soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. These soils formed in sandy and gravelly deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coloma, Covert, and Riverdale soils. Coloma soils lack a calcareous 2C horizon, and are on similar topographic positions as Toogood soils. The moderately well drained Covert and somewhat poorly drained Riverdale soils are in lower positions in the landscape than the Toogood soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Potential surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid in the solum and very rapid in the substratum.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in red pine plantations or idle grassland. Some areas are used for urban development. Native vegetation is oak, aspen, and maple forests.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 98 in southern Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Newaygo County, Michigan, 1990.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 10 cm (4 inches) (A horizon). 
Arenic feature: loamy sand to a depth of 86 cm (34 inches).

The areas with high chroma masses of oxidized iron below a depth of 76 cm (30 inches) will become a new series.
