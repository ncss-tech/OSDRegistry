TINEMAN SERIES

The Tineman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium and glacial till. Tineman soils are on nearly level to steep alluvial fans, stream terraces, mountains and moraines. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Tineman gravelly loam, rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--O to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine crumb structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky; many very fine and fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; 20 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary. (7 to 15 inches thick).
   
    Bw1--7 to 15 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky; many very fine and fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.

    Bw2--15 to 27 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; many very fine and fine, common medium and few coarse roots; 45 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6);   gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 12 to 24 inches)

    2C--27 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) extremely gravelly sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grained; loose; common very fine and fine roots; 65 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.8).

TYPE LOCATION: Teton County, Wyoming; first sample pit north of road; SW1/4 of the NE1/4 of sec. 29, T.44N., R.115W.
   
RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the 2C horizon is 26 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. The upper part of the control section has more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. When mixed, the control section averages more than 35 percent gravel and cobbles, and the matrix is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Surface stones or boulders are 0 to 3 percent. 

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or slightly acid.
   
The B horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam or sandy loam. This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.

The 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. It is very gravelly sand or loamy sand. This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.
   
COMPETING SERIES: These are the Antrobus, Broad Canyon, Enochlake, Farlow, Grafen, Greyback, Handran, Kamack, Klug, Maurice, Middlehill, Midelight, Midfork, Parachute, Sawpit, Sebud, Silvercliff, Supervisor, Surdal, Teemat, Thornburgh, Tiban, and Wareagle series. Antrobus soils formed in basaltic material and have more than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Grafen, Middlehill, Ramack, Supervisor, Surdal and Parachute soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Enochlake soils do not have a Bw horizon. Greyback, Farlow and Silvercliff soils have continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate. Broad Canyon, Handran, Kamack, Klug, Maurice, Midelight, Midfork, Sebud, Sawpit, Thornburgh and Tiban soils lack 2C horizons within 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Tineman soils are on nearly level to steep alluvial fans, stream terraces, mountains and moraines. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in noncalcareous alluvium and glacial till. Elevation is 5,500 to 7,500 feet. The average annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches. The mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearmouth and Leavitt soils. Bearmouth soils have very gravelly sand IIC horizons at depths of 10 to 25 inches. Leavitt soils have argillic horizons and are fine-loamy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well to somewhat excessively drained; slow to moderate runoff;
moderate permeability. A water table may be present in some soils below 36 inches.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated cropland, rangeland, homesites and other community uses, recreation, and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, prairie junegrass, and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In the intermountain valleys of western Wyoming. The series is of moderate extent.
