TORRY SERIES

The Torry series consists of very poorly drained soils that are more than 50 inches thick over limestone.  Torry soils formed in organic and mineral deposits of freshwater marshes.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Euic, hyperthermic Typic Haplosaprists

TYPICAL PEDON:  Torry muck--cultivated

    Oap--0 to 12 inches; black, (10YR 2/1) muck; less than 5 percent unrubbed fiber; moderate fine and medium granular structure; friable; 52 percent mineral content; slightly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (6 to 14 inches thick)

    Oa1--12 to 36 inches; black (10YR 2/1) muck; less than 5 percent unrubbed fiber; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; very sticky; 56 percent mineral content; slightly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

    Oa2--36 to 65 inches; black (10YR 2/1) muck; less than 5 percent rubbed fiber; massive; slightly sticky; 35 percent mineral content; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (The Oa horizon extends to a depth of 51 to 80 inches).

    2R--65 inches; soft to hard but rippable limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Palm Beach County, Florida; 3 1/8 miles S. of S.R. 717 and 100 ft. W. of railroad; SE1/4
NE1/4NW1/4NW1/4  sec. 2, T. 43 S., R. 37 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of organic material and depth to limestone is 51 to 80 inches.  Calcium chloride reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.

The Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is muck with 40 to 70 percent mineral content in the upper part and 10 to 40 percent in the lower part.  Fiber content is less than 15 percent rubbed.

The 2 R horizon is soft to hard but rippable limestone.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Terra Ceia series in the same family and the Lauderhill, Okeelanta and Pahokee series.  Terra Ceia soils have less mineral content.  Lauderhill and Pahokee soils have a lithic contact within 51 inches.  Okeelanta soils have mineral layers and lack limestone bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Torry soils are in freshwater marshes within peninsular Florida.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  Precipitation averages 59 inches and air temperature averages 75 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Terra Ceia, Lauderhill, and Pahokee soils on similar landforms.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Moderate permeability.  In natural areas the water table is at or above the surface for much of the year; in other areas the water table is controlled by man.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Torry soils are used for growing sugar cane, corn, truck crops, sod, and improved pasture.  Natural vegetation is willow, elderberry, sawgrass, ferns, flags, pickerelweed, and maiden cane.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Interior of southern Peninsular Florida.  The series is of moderate extent.
