TIDEHAVEN SERIES

The Tidehaven series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on coastal prairies.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1145 mm (49 in).

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil Moisture: An udic soil moisture regime.  The soil moisture control section is from 10 to 61 cm (4 to 24 in) in depth.  These soils remain moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 275 days in normal years, with rainfall being fairly uniform throughout the year. The winter months have slightly less rainfall but soil moisture is highest due to decreased evapotranspiration. Soil moisture is lowest during the summer months when evapotranspiration is highest.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Permeability is slow.  Runoff is high. These soils remain saturated without aquic conditions 15 to 91 cm (6 to 36 in) below the surface for more than 30 cumulative days in normal years. The saturation mainly occurs from January to March and is not continuous.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for cropland and pastureland. A few areas are in rangeland. Native vegetation includes bluestems and paspalums. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Texas coastal plain; Gulf Coast Prairies (MLRA 150A) Land Resource Region T, mainly from the Colorado River to the Brazos River.  The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Matagorda County, Texas, 2016.

REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped as the Telferner series. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle size control section: 13 to 63 cm (5 to 25 in).  (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon) 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in).  (Ap and A2 horizon) 
Argillic horizon: 18 to 203 cm (7 to 80 in).  (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, 2Btk1, 2Btk2 horizons)
Secondary carbonates: 156 to 203 cm (62 to 80 in) (2Btk1 and 2Btk2 horizons)
Lithologic Discontinuity: 156 to 203 cm (62 to 80 in) (2Btk1 and 2Btk2 horizons. 

Additional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity was determined by the ratio of very fine sand to fine sand which is markedly different than the overlying horizons and coincides where the horizon color is 7.5YR or redder and the presence of mica flakes. The reddish subsoil and mica flakes are considered to be a marker of Colorado River sediments.

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil survey office lab data available on the typical pedon (NASIS user site id of S2015TX3214233).
