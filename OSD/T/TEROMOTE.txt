TEROMOTE SERIES

The Teromote series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from shale.  Teromote soils are on knolls, valley and valley sides with slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Teromote loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--2 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (9 to 26 inches thick)

    Bk--12 to 65 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine pores; violently effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate accumulations; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Rio Arriba County, New Mexico; 0.6 mile south and 6 miles west of Cebolla, New Mexico; 1,198 feet north and 1,407 feet west of the SE corner of Sec. 33, T. 27 N., R. 3 E.;  106 degrees, 37 minutes, 16 seconds west longitude;  36 degrees, 31 minutes, 35 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section December through April and July through October.  The soil is driest during May and June.

Soil Temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  less than 15 percent

Percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section:  20 to 35 percent clay


A horizon:  

Value - 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist 

Chroma:  3 or 4.  


Bw horizon:  

Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y. 

Value:  4 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.  

Chroma:  2 through 4. 

Texture:  loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam 

Reaction:  slightly to moderately alkaline


Bk horizon:

Hue:10YR or 2.5Y. 

Value:  4 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.  

Chroma:  2 through 4. 

Texture:  loam, silty clay loam or clay loam


C horizon 

Hue: 10YR or 2.5Y

Value: 4 to 7 dry or moist

Chroma: 2 to 4 dry or moist

Texture: fine sandy loam, or clay loam

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Berthoud(OK) series.  Berthoud soils have mean annual temperatures of 54 to 57 degrees F. and are typically moist in early spring.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Teromote soils are on knolls, valley and valley sides.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 7,100 to 7,400 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium from shale.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 100 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ruson and Berryman soils.  Ruson soils lack a cambic horizon.  Berryman soils have carbonatic mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Teromote soils are used for grazing livestock. The vegetation is western wheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, galleta, and blue grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.
