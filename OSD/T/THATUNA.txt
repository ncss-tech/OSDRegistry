6/2016--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the final correlation of the Spokane County, Washington, soil survey. The soils may have volcanic ash above the Btb horizon; further investigation is required. The formatting of the OSD was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).
