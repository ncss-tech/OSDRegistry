TWINPEAKS SERIES

The Twinpeaks series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained soils that are moderately permeable in the upper part and very slowly permeable in the petrocalcic horizon.  These undulating soils formed in gravelly loamy alluvium derived from chert and limestone.  They occur on alluvial fans and pediments situated below chert and limestone hills.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Ustalfic Petrocalcids

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Terino (NM) series. Terino soils average less than 60 percent andesite and rhyolite rock fragment in the particle size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Twinpeaks soils are on alluvial fans and pediments below and adjacent to hills and mountains. The soils formed in very gravelly sediments derived primarily from chert and limestone bedrock. Slopes are dominantly 1 to 8 percent but range up to about 20 percent. The elevation ranges from 3,500 to 4,500 feet. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 60 to 65 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches with a summer maximum. Frost free period range from 210 to 260 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Bissett, Bullis, Buckear, Catto, Coyanosa, Paisano, and Stillwell series.  Bissett soils are shallow and very shallow to a lithic contact over limestone bedrock.  Bullis soils occur on similar landforms, but are very deep and do not have a petrocalcic horizon.  Buckear soils are shallow and very shallow to a paralithic contact over shale bedrock.  Catto soils are shallow and very shallow to a lithic contact over chert bedrock.  Coyanosa soils are shallow and very shallow to lithic contact over sandstone bedrock.  Paisano soils occur on similar landforms, but do not contain an argillic horizon.  Stillwell occur on alluvial flats below Twinpeaks soils, and do not contain an argillic horizon.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately slow permeable in the upper part and very slow in the petrocalcic horizon. Runoff is very high. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Twinpeaks soils are used as rangeland.  Dominant woody plants include creosotebush, mariola, javelina bush, whitethorn acacia, mesquite, tarbush, ephedra, and allthorn.  Characteristic grasses include black grama, hairy grama, cane bluestem, threeawns, red grama, fluffgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Marathon Basin and similar areas of Trans-Pecos Texas.  Southern Desertic Basins, Plains, and Mountains, Desert Grassland Ecological zone (MLRA 42). The series is moderately extensive.
