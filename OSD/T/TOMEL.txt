TOMEL SERIES

The Tomel series consists of shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale, siltstone, limestone, chert, and interbedded quartz.  Tomel soils are on fan remnants, fan piedmonts and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; approximately 470 feet north of the southeast corner of Section 30, T. 8 N., R. 43 E.; USGS Seyler Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 31 minutes 1 seconds N and longitude 117 degrees 11 minutes 10 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.5170556 latitude, -117.1858333 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September and October due to convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to duripan: 25 to 50 cm.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lyda, Maggie, Silverbow, Stingdorn and Tokoper series.  

Lyda soils have heavy clay loam or light clay subhorizons in the Bt horizon that are 15 to 25 cm thick.  Maggie soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Silverbow soils have 50 to 70 percent rock fragments, dominantly stones and cobbles, and Bt horizons that are calcareous throughout.  Stingdorn and Tokoper soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 50 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Tomel soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Elevations are 1,278 to 2,091 meters.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from shale, limestone, chert and interbedded quartz.  The climate is warm, arid with a mean annual precipitation of 125 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Laxal and Penelas soils.   Laxal soils lack an argillic horizon and a duripan. Penelas soils lack a duripan and are shallow over shale.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the duripan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.   The vegetation is principally Bailey greasewood, shadscale, bud sagebrush, galleta, King desertgrass, kochia, Nevada ephedra, Indian ricegrass, and sand dropseed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nevada.  These soils are inextensive.  MLRA 29.
