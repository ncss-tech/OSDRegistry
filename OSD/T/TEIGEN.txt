TEIGEN SERIES

The Teigen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from acid fissile shales.  These soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fergus County, Montana, 1979.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations record:  MT0336.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface mixed to 7 inches (A, Bw1 horizons); a cambic horizon from 4 to 17 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3 horizons); and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw2, Bw3, BC, C1, part of C2 horizon).  Teigen soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Classification changed from Borollic Camborthids to Aridic Ustochrepts in 1993.
