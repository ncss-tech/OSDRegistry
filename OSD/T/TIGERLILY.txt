TIGERLILY SERIES

The Tigerlily series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks. The Tigerlily soils are on seeps in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, isotic, nonacid, frigid Hydraquentic Humaquepts

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family at this time.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Tigerlily soils are on linear to concave seeps on mountain slopes, plateaus, glacial-valley walls, moraines, glacial-valley floors, and cirque floors. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks. Elevation is 1715 to 3245 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation 425 to 1515 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 2 to 9 degrees C. The frost free season is 60 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lackey and Pigchute soils. The Lackey soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes and moraines, are sandy-skeletal, and are somewhat excessively drained. The Pigchute soils are on linear backslopes of mountain slopes and moraines and are well-drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained, moderately high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity, frequent flooding for brief (2 to 7 days) duration from May to July. Seasonal high water table at 0 to 10 cm.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is Sierra lodgepole pine, tiger lily, horsetail, corn lily, bigleaf lupine, Sierra willow, Lemmon's willow, bulrush, wild onion, carex, sedges, and grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are not extensive.
