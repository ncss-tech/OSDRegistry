HARLEQUIN SERIES

The Harlequin series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift overlying residuum.  Harlequin soils are found on slopes of 0 to 85 percent on valley walls, ridges and cirques of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2350 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, isotic Lithic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Harlequin sandy loam, with approximately 10 percent of the soil surface covered with subangular stones, located on a forested southeast facing valley wall with a slope of 75 percent and an elevation of 1,585 meters.  When described on August 12, 2009 the soil was slightly moist throughout.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted)

     Oi--0 to 6 cm; slightly decomposed plant material; few fine to medium roots; abrupt wavy boundary.

     A--6 to 24 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky, nonplastic; few very fine and common fine to coarse roots; common medium irregular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; very strongly acid (pH 4.5); clear irregular boundary.

     Bw--24 to 46 cm; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; loose, nonsticky, nonplastic; few fine to medium roots; common medium irregular pores; 10 percent gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary.

     2R--46 cm; indurated granite bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Whatcom County, Washington; approximately 30 km northwest of the town of Newhalem along the Copper Ridge trail, North Cascades National Park Service Complex; 40 m east and 735 m north of the southwest corner of section 2, T. 39 N, R. 10 E. Willamette Meridian; Copper Mountain, Washington USGS quadrangle; 48 degrees, 53 minutes, 47 seconds north latitude and 121 degrees, 28 minutes, 35 seconds west longitude; UTM 611677 meters E, 5417048 meters N, zone 10 NAD83.

Bw horizon
Hue - 7.5YR or 10YR
Value - 3 to 4 moist, 5 to 6 dry
Chroma - 3 to 4 moist or dry
Fine earth texture - SL or FSL
Reaction - very strongly acid to strongly acid

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Granturk and Lostlake series.  Granturk soils are derived from redbed sandstone and have a clay content ranging from 20 to 35 percent.  Lostlake soils have a clay content ranging from 20 to 27 percent.  Granturk and Lostlake soils can be dry in the moisture control section up to 45 consecutive days.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harlequin soils are found on slopes of 0 to 85 percent on valley walls, ridges and cirques of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations above 1,300 meters.  They formed in colluvium from glacial drift overlying residuum.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,950 to 2,700 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 0 to 4 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Doubtful, Perfect, Stetattle, and Treen soils.  Doubtful soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 cm) to a lithic contact and have an ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size control section.  Perfect and Stetattle soils are very deep (greater than 150 cm to a lithic contact) and have sandy-skeletal particle size control sections.  Stetattle soils have an umbric epipedon and andic soil materials greater than 90 cm thick.  Treen soils have a medial particle size control section and andic soil properties throughout the soil profile.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Harlequin soils support wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed drainage. Native vegetation includes Pacific silver fir, mountain hemlock, Engelmann spruce, and subalpine fir.  Understory species include black gooseberry and Sitka valerian.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Cascade Mountains, Washington.  MLRA 3.  Series is of small extent.
