HORNICK SERIES

The Hornick series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey and silty alluvium.  These soils are on remnants of old stream meanders and natural levees on flood plains in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty over clayey, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Hapludolls
