HEALYLAKE SERIES

The Healylake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy deposits on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, mesic, ortstein Oxyaquic Haplorthods

TYPICAL PEDON: Healylake sand, on a south facing, convex, 1 percent slope in a forested area at an elevation of 240 meters (787 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on October 3, 1996, the soil was moist throughout.)

 E--10 to 23 cm (4 to 9 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/2) sand, light gray (7.5YR 7/1) dry; weak medium granular structure; very friable; many fine to coarse roots; very strongly acid; clear irregular boundary. [8 to 28 cm (3 to 11 inches) thick]

 Bhs--23 to 28 cm (9 to 11 inches); reddish black (2.5YR 2.5/1) sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and coarse roots; columns of moderately cemented reddish black (2.5YR 2.5/1) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) ortstein 15 to 56 cm (6 to 22 inches) wide and 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 inches) apart extend into the Bs2 horizon; ortstein occupies about 55 percent of the horizon; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [2.5 to 8 cm (1 to 3 inches) thick]

 Bs1--28 to 36 cm (11 to 14 inches); yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine and medium roots; columns of moderately cemented reddish black (2.5YR 2.5/1) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) ortstein 15 to 51 cm (6 to 20 inches) wide and 8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) apart extend into this horizon from the Bhs horizon; ortstein occupies about 65 percent of the horizon; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bs2--36 to 66 cm (14 to 26 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; few fine and medium roots; columns of moderately cemented reddish black (2.5YR 2.5/1) and yellowish red (5YR 4/6) ortstein 15 to 38 cm (6 to 15 inches) wide and 8 to 15 cm (3 to 6 inches) apart extend into this horizon from the Bs1 horizon; ortstein occupies about 65 percent of the horizon; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bs horizon is 15 to 66 cm (6 to 26 inches).]

 BC--66 to 99 cm (26 to 39 inches); brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sand; massive; very friable; few fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary. [0 to 38 cm (15 inches) thick]

 C1--99 to 160 cm (39 to 63 inches); yellow (10YR 7/6) sand; massive; very friable; many fine to coarse prominent yellowish red (5YR 5/8) masses of oxidized iron; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 C2--160 to 203 cm (63 to 80 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand; massive; very friable; moderately acid.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Healylake soils are on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The Healylake soils formed in sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 mm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 9.4 degrees C (47 to 49 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Grattan, Kaleva, Benzonia, Copemish, Saugatuck, and Dair soils. The Grattan, Kaleva, Benzonia, and Copemish soils are on higher landscape positions. The Saugatuck and Dair soils are wetter members of a drainage sequence with the Healylake soils.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) between October and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Healylake soils are forested or are idle. Some areas are planted to pine trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 96 in northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. The series is of small extent.
