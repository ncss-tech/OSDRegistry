HUNTERS SERIES

The Hunters series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments. The Hunters soils are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about (7.8 degrees C), and the mean annual precipitation is about 425 mm.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hunters soils are on terrace risers and treads.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. Hunters soils formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations are 395 to 1250 meters. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation 375 to 650 mm, and the mean annual air temperature 7.5 to 1.0 degrees C. The frost-free season is 95 to 135 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedonia, Chesaw, Garrison, Hodgson, Mires, Molson, Republic, Scala, and Stevens soils. Cedonia soils lack a mollic epipedon and are on lake terraces.  Chesaw soils have a sandy-skeletal control section and are on outwash terraces. Garrison soils have a loamy-skeletal control section and are on outwash terraces. Hodgson soils are fine-family and are on terraces. Mires soils have a medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section and are on outwash terraces. Molson soils have a medial over loamy control section and are on hills. Republic and Stevens soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Republic soils are on fans and terraces and Stevens soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains. Scala soils have a coarse-loamy control section and have an ochric epipedon and are on terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for cropland, woodland, and grazing land. Alfalfa and grass hay, small grains are common crops. The native vegetation is ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with an understory of pinegrass, Idaho fescue, rough fescues, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, and common snowberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington; MLRA 43A. Series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Stevens County, Washington, 1913. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:
Mollic epipedon: from 0 to 30 cm (Ap and A horizons)
Cambic horizon: from 30 to 102 cm (Bw, Bk1, Bk2 horizons)
Vitrandic feature: from 0 to 51 cm (Ap, A, Bw horizons)
Particle-size control section: from 25 to 100 cm (part of A, Bw, Bk1, part of Bk2 horizons)

Additional Information: The zone from 30 to 51 cm (Bw horizon) meets the color requirements for a mollic epipedon but has less than 1 percent organic matter based on laboratory data. 

This description reflects a change in classification as of 5/00 with the addition of a superactive cation exchange activity class. The soil was originally classified as a Calcic Haploxeroll.  Calcium carbonate percent based on laboratory data.  The description as of 03/04 reflects a revision in horizon designation by removing the lithologic discontinuity as related to ash influence. This surface influence of ash is highly mixed and not readily discernable from the subsoil. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for this pedon. Sample number 69WA010-1, pedon number 06937; NSSL-Riverside, CA, 2/1972.
