HEIMDAL SERIES 

The Heimdal series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous glacial till.  These soils are on glacial till plains and moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 17 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Calcic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Heimdal loam - cropland.  (Colors for dry soil unless otherwise stated) 

   Ap--0 to 5 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; very friable; many pores; neutral; abrupt boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick) 

   Bw1--5 to 14 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, very dark grayish (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate coarse and medium prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; very friable; many fine pores; neutral; gradual boundary. 

   Bw2--14 to 19 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate coarse and medium prismatic structure parting to weak coarse subangular blocky; very friable; many fine pores; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined Bw horizons 6 to 16 inches thick) 

   Bk--19 to 34 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; very friable; common threads and nodules of carbonates; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual boundary.  (6 to 25 inches thick) 

   C--34 to 60 inches; pale yellow (2.5Y 7/3) loam, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) moist; few coarse distinct gray (5Y 6/1) redox depletions and a few fine prominent dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) redox concentrations; weak subangular blocky and platy structure; few white carbonate nodules; violent effervescence; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION:  Wells County, North Dakota; 1,340 feet west and 150 feet south of northeast corner, Sec. 14, T. 148 N., R. 70 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 12 to 26 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness. The control section commonly is loam averaging less than 18 percent clay.  In some pedons it is sandy loam that has less than 55 percent total sand. Pebbles and stones are common throughout the pedon.  The soil contains up to 10 percent rock fragments throughout.  Stony phases are recognized. 

The Ap horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It typically is a loam, but silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam and sandy loam are within the range.  It is slightly acid or neutral. 

The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. 

The Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It commonly has more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon. 

The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is calcareous loam glacial till, but fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam and very fine sandy loam are within the range.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons it has strata of fine sand to sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have a sandy 2C horizon below 40 inches. 

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dunnville, Egeland, Kalispell and Lanona series.  Dunnville soils are acid throughout the solum and occur in more moist areas.  Egeland soils have more than 55 percent sand in the 10- to 40 inch control section and formed in glacial outwash. Kalispell soils are shallower to carbonates (see remarks).  Lanona soils have a discontinuity with horizons having more than 18 percent clay between a depth of 20 and 40 inches. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Heimdal soils are on level to very steep moraines and till plains.  Slope gradients typically are from 2 to 5 percent but range from 0 to 40 percent.  The soil is formed in calcareous glacial till.  The climate is cool, subhumid, with a mean annual air temperature ranging from 38 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 25 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer.  The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  The elevation ranges from 900 to 2350 feet. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Emrick, Esmond, Fram, Parnell and Tonka series in a drainage sequence.  Emrick soils are on concave foot slopes;  Esmond soils are on convex shoulder slopes; Fram soils on flats and rims surrounding depressions; and Parnell and Tonka soils are in depressions.  Emrick soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Esmond soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Fram soils have and aquic moisture regime.  Parnell soils are very poorly drained and Tonka soils are poorly drained. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is negligible to high depending on slope.   Permeability is moderate. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all cultivated for production of small grains and flax.  Native vegetation includes green needlegrass, western wheatgrass, blue grama and forbs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North central and east central North Dakota, west central Minnesota, and South Dakota.  The series is extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Wells County, North Dakota, 1970. 

REMARKS:  The official description for Kalispell is old (4/57) and does not have sufficient detail to clearly differentiate from the Heimdal series. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 14 inches (A and Bw1 horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 14 to 19 inches (Bw2 horizon).
