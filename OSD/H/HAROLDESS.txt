HAROLDESS SERIES

The Haroldess series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in tephra residuum. Haroldess soils are on cinder cones and volcanic fields. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haroldess soils are on tephra deposits at elevations of 5,980 to 6,680 feet (1,823 to 2,036 meters). Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in residuum of tephra deposits. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches (254 to 356 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September as gentle rains and snowfall during December to February. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit (  to  degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Wupatki (AZ), Wukoki (AZ), and Gemcity (AZ), soils.  Gemcity soils form in basalt residuum have calcic and argillic horizons, are moderately deep, and have more than 14 percent clay and less than 35 percent gravel fragments in the particle size control section. Wupatki soils form in tephra residuum and are shallow or moderately deep to duripan, and have no argillic horizon.  Wukoki soils form in tephra residuum or alluvium over residuum and are shallow to strongly contrasting particle sizes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes blue grama, galleta, broom snakeweed, black grama, and fourwing saltbush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. Haroldess soils are of limited extent. MLRA 35 Land Resource Unit 35.1. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Coconino County, Arizona; Colton Crater Soil Survey Update Project, AZ, 2018

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

The epipedon is neither mollic nor ochric because tephra structure exists in surface fragments and within the upper two horizons. 

Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 17 inches (19 to 43 cm) (Bt horizons) 
Duripan - the zone from 21 to 60 inches (54 to 150 cm) (Bqkm or Bqm horizons) 

Particle size control section - the argillic horizon (19 to 43 cm) (Bt horizons)
