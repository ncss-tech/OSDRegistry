HARPER SERIES

The Harper series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum over limestone bedrock.  These nearly level to steep soils formed in residuum derived from limestone and occur on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, thermic Lithic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Harper clay, very stony--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     A1--0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 in); black (10YR 2/1) clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine subangular blocky and granular structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; 5 to 15 percent of cobble and stone size fragments on the surface; less than 5 percent of limestone fragments in the soil; noncalcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. 

     A2--18 to 43 cm (7 to 17 in); black (10YR 2/1) clay, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common fine and medium roots; noncalcareous; moderately alkaline; abrupt wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness is 10 to 50 cm [4 to 20 in])

     R--43 to 68 (17 to 27 in); indurated, fractured dolomitic limestone bedrock.
