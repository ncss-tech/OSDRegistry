HARJO SERIES

The Harjo series consists of deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils. They formed in predominantly clayey alluvium of Holocene age. These nearly level soils are on flood plains in concave positions of the Cross Timbers. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Typic Fluvaquents 

TYPICAL PEDON: Harjo clay-rangeland, at an elevation of 259 m (850 ft). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    A1--0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in); dark red (2.5YR 3/6) clay; weak medium platy in upper part and weak medium subangular blocky structure in lower part; extremely hard, firm; calcareous; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. 

    A2--25 to 91 cm (10 to 36 in); reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) clay; few fine faint red (2.5YR 4/6) mottles; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine blocky; extremely hard, firm; calcareous; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 33 to 150 cm [13 to 60 in]) 

    C--91 to 165 cm (36 to 65 in); red (2.5YR 4/6) clay; massive; extremely hard, firm; few thin strata of dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) and weak red (10R 4/4) clay loam; calcareous; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, about 3 miles south and 1 mile west of Maud; about 400 feet west and 1100 feet north of the southeast corner of sec. 8, T. 7 N., R. 5 E.

COMPETING SERIES: There is no series in the same family. Soils in similar families are the Chastain, Fausse, Hayti, Mhoon, Miller, Tuscumbia, and Yorktown series. 
Chastain soils: have kaolinitic mineralogy and are noncalcareous 
Fausse and Yorktown soils: have very-fine control sections, smectitic mineralogy, and are noncalcareous 
Hayti and Mhoon soils: have fine-silty control sections and are noncalcareous Miller soils: have mollic epipedons 
Tuscumbia soils: are noncalcareous, have cambic horizons, and have vertic properties 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent material: formed in calcareous clayey and loamy sediments of Holocene age
Landscape: alluvial plains
Landform: flood plains
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean annual precipitation: 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 in) 
Climate: moist subhumid
Thornthwaite annual P-E indices: 44 to 64

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Gracemont series on higher positions. 
Gracemont soils: have a coarse-loamy control section

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma; 1974. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 91 cm (0 to 36 in) (A1, A2 horizons) 
Fluvaquentic feature: soils with an aquic moisture regime that are saturated with water at some time of the year within 30 cm (12 in) of the soil surface and have an irregular decrease in organic matter content in the 91 to 165 cm (36 to 65 in) zone (C horizon). The high chroma throughout the soil is related to the red parent material. The requirement for low chroma is waived on the assumption the saturated zone is devoid of oxygen and the red colors remain after citrate-dithionate extraction.
