HUNEWILL SERIES

The Hunewill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Hunewill soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, ballenas, and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bairs, Basket, Breko, Chiefrange, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Huilepass, Jungo, Kayo, Lithgow, Plush, Schader, Stucky, and Washoe series.

Bairs soils are dominated by stones and cobbles in the particle-size control section and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 58 to 114 cm.  Basket and Chiefrange soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms. Breko soils are effervescent to the surface and have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C.  Cowgil soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 76 cm.  Drino, Lithgow, and Schader soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Hefed soils have C horizons with very cobbly textures under the argillic horizon.  Huilepass soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to summer convection storms.  Jungo soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have horizons with secondary carbonates at depths of 8 to 20 cm from the soil surface, and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 100 to more than 50 cm. Kayo soils have 13 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Plush soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Stucky soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 76 cm.  Washoe soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 61 to 114 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hunewill soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, ballenas, and inset fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,250 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Stucky soil and the Veta soil.  Veta soils have cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium through very high surface runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hunewill soils are mainly used for livestock grazing, but some small areas are cultivated.  The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail. . This pedon is correlated to R026XY016NV, Loamy 8-10 PZ.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Western and northeastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.  The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 26, while other acreage occurs in MLRAs 25 and 27.
