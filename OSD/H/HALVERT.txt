HALVERT SERIES

Halvert series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from basalt and andesite.  Halvert soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring; dry from July through October; aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness:30 to 60 cm; includes the Btss horizon.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Halvert soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on footslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from basalt or andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 1,880 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Devada, Jaybee and Tunnison soils.  Devada and Jaybee soils are shallow to bedrock.  Tunnison soils have vertical cracks that extend to the surface and do not have a duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium or high surface runoff; low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Halvert soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is dominantly Lahontan sagebrush, Sandberg's bluegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 4,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
