HALEMAUMAU SERIES

The Halemaumau series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash deposited over basic pahoehoe lava. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 1,650 millimeters (65 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C. (60 degrees F.)
 
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy, glassy, isothermic Typic Ustivitrands
 
TYPICAL PEDON: Halemaumau gravelly ashy sandy loam, on a dissected 10 percent side slope under scattered ohia trees and shrubs at an elevation of 1,170 meters (3,840 feet).  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted. Colors are lithochromic at depths below 25 centimeters (10 inches). When described on 1/13/97 the soil was slightly moist throughout. All textures are "apparent field textures". pH was determined by adjusting field organic dye values via regression to approximate pH in 1:1 water.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Halemaumau soils formed in the Kilauea Volcano, Keanakakoi surge and airfall pyroclastic deposits over pahoehoe lava. They are mainly on Kilauea pahoehoe flows less than 750 years old at elevations from 1,070 to 1,250 meters (3,500 to 4,100 feet). Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual rainfall is 1270 to 2032 millimeters (50 to 80 inches), with about 90 percent of the rainfall occurring between October and May. The mean annual pan evaporation is 1,270 to 1,780 centimeters (50 to 70 inches). The mean annual air temperature is 13 to 18 degrees C. (55 to 65 degrees F.)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alahapa, Heake, Kilauea, Lithic Ustipsamments, and Lithic Ustorthents soils. Alahapa soils are fragmental `a`a soils. Heake, Lithic Ustipsamments, and Lithic Ustorthents soils are less than 50 centimeters (20 inches) deep to bedrock. Kilauea soils are deep, more than 100 centimeters (40 inches) to bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. In areas with surface crust, runoff is very high and permeability is very slow. In areas without surface crust, runoff is low and permeability is rapid. Permeability is very slow in the underlying bedrock. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for National Park Service land. Vegetation is aalii (Dodonaea viscosa), bamboo orchid (Arundina graminifolia), broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus), bushy beardgrass (Schizachyrium condensatum), ohelo (Vaccinium reticulatum), ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha), pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae), ulei or rose family (Osteomeles anthyllidifolia), and uki sedge (Machaerina angustifolia). 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Island of Hawaii, within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park; MLRA 161. The series is of small extent, approximately 650 acres.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Island of Hawaii, Hawaii County, Hawaii, Proposed in 1996. Established in 2008. The name is from Halemaumau Crater.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from the soil surface to a depth to 8 centimeters (3 inches) (A horizon).
Andic soil properties - from the soil surface to 71 centimeters (28 inches) (C and 2C horizons).
Depth to bedrock - 71 centimeters (28 inches).
Soil temperature - mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.) (Iso temperature regime).
Soil moisture - dry in some or all parts for a four-month period from June to September in most years (Ustic moisture regime).
The Halemaumau soil with a cindery control section is a taxajunct. 

Edit Log: 12/03 KH. Added "ashy" modifier to textures; changed soil reaction in Range in Characteristics.
2/01 KH. Minimum slope range changed from 10 to 2 percent. Rock fragments added to Range in Characteristics of A horizon. Previous high runoff and moderately rapid permeability changed to separate classes for areas with and without surface crust.
Okinas removed in 2008 for simplicity under direction of the State Soil Scientist.
