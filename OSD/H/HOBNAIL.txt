HOBNAIL SERIES

The Hobnail series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on benches, dissected terraces and hills. They formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from shales, quartzite, or mica schist, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Permeability is slow. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 38 inches and average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy, amorphic over isotic, frigid Oxyaquic Udivitrands

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hobnail soils are on all aspects of dissected terraces and foothills. Slopes range from 5 to 35 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from shale, quartzite, or mica schist, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 1,600 to 4,000 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches. The frost-free period is from 80 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the  Bouldercreek, Honeyjones, and Hugus soils and the Helmer soils. Bouldercreek and Honeyjones soils are on steeper, convex, north-facing backslopes of mountains and are ashy over loamy-skeletal. Hugus soils are on steeper, north-facing, convex, dissected terrace slopes and foothills, and are loamy-skeletal. Helmer soils are on concave terraces and have a fragipan.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; slow permeability. A seasonally perched water table is present at a depth of 1 to 2 feet, February to April.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, livestock grazing, recreation, wildlife habitat, hay and pasture, and homesites. Potential natural vegetation is mainly western hemlock, western redcedar, western white pine, grand fir, Douglas-fir, western larch, and lodgepole pine, with an understory of queencup beadlily, American trailplant, Columbia brome, violet, starry false-Solomon's-seal, sweetscented bedstraw, goldthread, Oregon fairybells, oneleaf foamflower, piper anemone, northern twinflower, and western rattlesnake plantain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho; MLRA 43A. This soil is moderately extensive.
