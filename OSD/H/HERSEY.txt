HERSEY SERIES

The Hersey series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 100 to 200 centimeters of loess and in the underlying till. These soils are on remnants of ground moraines on dissected glaciated bedrock-controlled uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Pepin County, Wisconsin, 1998. Source of name is the local name for this pre-Illinoian glacial till. 

REMARKS:
Particle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 20 to 70 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);
series control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 292 centimeters.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:
ochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 centimeters (Ap horizon);
argillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 292 centimeters (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, 2Bt5 and 2Bt6 horizons);
udic moisture regime.

Cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab data from National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.

Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.

This soil was formerly mapped with the Otterholt and Spencer series in this part of Wisconsin. The loamy glacial till is of pre-Illinoian age and is locally referred to as the "Hersey" till. It is oxidized and leached of carbonates in the upper part.
