Drainage class--poorly drained--these soils are frequently saturated at the soil surface to a depth of 0.3 meter during the wettest periods of years when precipitation is within one standard deviation of the 30 year mean of annual precipitation, this saturation is considered apparent
Saturated hydraulic conductivity--0.1 to 1.0 micrometers per second

Most areas are cultivated. The principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay. The native vegetation is big bluestem, western wheatgrass, sedges, blue grama and other species of the tall grass prairie that are tolerant of excessive wetness.
