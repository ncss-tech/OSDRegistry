HEMBRILLO SERIES

The Hembrillo series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in sandy gypsiferous eolian deposits. These rolling soils are on dunes. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Gypsic, thermic Typic Torripsamments

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hembrillo soils are on dunes. Slope is 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed from sandy gypsiferous eolian deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,900 to 4,270 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls in all months as gentle winter storms and with increased amounts during high intensity summer storms.  The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Shrike (T) (NM), Aerobee, and Shot series. Shrike soils are on interdunes and have a fine-loamy lacustrine layer beneath the sandy particle-size control section. Aerobee soils are on interdunes and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Shot soils are on dunes and have pedogenic gypsum nests. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Excessively drained; negligible runoff; very rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are military exercises and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation is broom dalea, giant dropseed, four-wing saltbush, soaptree yucca, and Torrey's ephedra. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: South central New Mexico, limited to the Tularosa Basin. MLRA 42, Lark is of limited extent.
