HAYSPUR SERIES

The Hayspur series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on floodplains and drainageways. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and rapid in the underlying material. These soils formed mainly in recent stratified alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slope ranges from O to 2 percent. The average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hayspur clay loam--on a nearly level hay field at an elevation of 5,325 feet. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated. When described on September 1, 1981, the soil was nearly dry above 10 inches, moist to 38 inches, and wet below.)

     Ak--O to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate coarse granular structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular and interstitial pores; slightly effervescent with disseminated lime; 10 percent pebbles; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary. (O to 10 inches thick)

     A--4 to 13 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; common fine distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist, mottles; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; common organic stains; common uncoated silt grains on faces of peds; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 18 inches thick)

     AC--13 to 21 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 13 inches thick)

     Ab--21 to 30 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; common fine faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist, mottles; weak coarse subangular blocky structure parting to moderate very fine subangular blocky; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. (O to 15 inches thick)

     Bkg--30 to 40 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, dark gray (5Y 4/1) moist; massive; very hard, friable, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; strongly effervescent, lime segregated in common fine filaments and soft masses; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (O to 20 inches thick)

     Cg1--40 to 46 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/2) silt loam, olive gray (5Y 4/2) moist; many large faint dark gray, (5Y 4/1) moist, and olive (5Y 4/3) moist, mottles; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; common fine dark concretions (Mn oxides); moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); gradual wavy boundary.

     Cg2--46 to 59 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) silt loam, olive (5Y 5/3) moist; common medium faint greenish gray (5GY 5/1) moist, mottles; massive; very hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine dark concretions (Mn oxides); mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the Cgl and Cg2 horizons is 15 to 40 inches)

     2C--59 to 84 inches; variegated very gravelly loamy sand; single grain; loose.

TYPE LOCATION: Elko County, Nevada; about 4 miles northwest of Owyhee; 1,900 feet south and 500 feet east of the northwest corner of section.  18, T. 47 N., R.52 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Usually dry - moist during winter and spring dry, July through November.

Average annual soil temperature - 45 to 47 degrees F.

Depth to sand and gravel - 40 inches or more.

Mollic epipedon - 12 to 18 inches.



Ak and A horizons - Value of 2 or 3 moist;

Chroma: 1 or 2

Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline

Sodium absorption ratio:  2 to 16.



AC, Ab, Bkg, and Cg horizons - Hue of 5Y through 10YR;

Value: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.

Chroma:  1 through 3.

Texture: Loam, clay loam or silt loam.

Clay content:  20 to 35 percent.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Paulina series. Paulina soils are noncalcareous throughout the profile.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hayspur soils are on level or very gently undulating or channeled floodplains and drainageways. Slope ranges from O to 2 percent. The soils formed in recent stratified alluvium over older sand and gravel alluvium, derived from mixed sources. Elevations are 5,260 to 5,600 feet. The climate is semiarid, with an average annual temperature of 43 to 45 degrees F, and average annual precipitation of 13 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and spring rain. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackfoot, Paynecreek, and Zola soils. Blackfoot soils are somewhat poorly drained and do not have sand and gravel within 60 inches. Paynecreek soils are on higher terraces, are well drained, and-have gravelly textures. Zola soils are moderately well drained and do not have sand and gravel within 60 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; slow runoff; permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and rapid in the underlying sand and gravel. The coils are flooded for long periods when streams overflow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all areas of Hayspur soils are used for hay and pasture. Native vegetation is tufted hairgrass, slender wheatgrass, sedges, and rushes.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Idaho and Northern Nevada. The series is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Davis, California

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Duck Valley Indian Reservation, parts of Owyhee County, Idaho and Elko County, Nevada, 1984.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (the Ak and A horizon)

Particle-size control section - at a depth of 10 to 40 inches (part of the A, AC, Ab and Bkq horizon)

Series control section - at a depth of 10 to 40 inches (part of the A, AC, Ab, and Bkq horizon)

Classification was changed in 1992 from Haplaquolls to Endoaquolls.

The superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.
