HESSEL SERIES

The Hessel series consists of deep and very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on ground moraines and glacial lake benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, calcareous, frigid Typic Epiaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hessel cobbly loam, in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Oi--5 to 0 cm (2 to 0 inches); mixed hardwood and conifer leaf litter.

 A--0 to20 cm (8 inches); very dark brown (10YR 2/2) cobbly loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; about 25 percent rock fragments; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [13 to 25 cm (5 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bg--20 to 33 cm (8 to 13 inches); grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) cobbly loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium prominent light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 25 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual wavy boundary. [2.5 to 30 cm (1 to 12 inches) thick]

 Cg--33 to 127 cm (13 to 50 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) cobbly loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; firm; many medium distinct dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) masses of oxidized iron; about 30 percent rock fragments; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline.

 2R--(127 to 137 cm 50 to 54 inches); limestone.

TYPE LOCATION: Charlevoix County, Michigan; about 3 miles northeast of Charlevoix; 1,000 feet east and 600 feet north of the southwest corner of sec. 8, T. 34 N., R. 7 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 25 to 56 cm (10 to 22 inches)
Depth to a lithic contact: more than 102 cm (40 to more than 60 inches)

A thin organic layer is on the surface of some pedons. 

A horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR, or is neutral
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 0 to 2
Texture: loam, mucky loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam, mucky gravelly loam, or mucky flaggy loam
Rock fragment content: 5 to 35 percent
Reaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline; some pedons have carbonates

Bg horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y, or is neutral
Value: 5 or 6
Chroma: 0 to 2
Texture: loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, or the gravelly, flaggy, or cobbly analogs of these textures
Rock fragment content: 5 to 35 percent

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 5Y
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, or the gravelly, flaggy or stony analogs of these textures
Rock fragment content: 5 to 35 percent

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hessel soils are in depressions on ground moraines and glacial lake benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Hessel soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The moderately well drained Johnswood soils and the somewhat poorly drained Detour soils are in the same drainage sequence.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in second growth forest. Cleared areas are used largely for pasture. Natural vegetation consisted primarily of northern whitecedar, black spruce, quaking aspen, tag alder, with some eastern white pine and eastern hemlock.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 94A, 94C, and 96 in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula and the eastern and southern part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, along the Great lakes. The series is of moderate extent.
