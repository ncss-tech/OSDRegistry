HEBBRONVILLE SERIES

The Hebbronville series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy sediments of alluvial and/or eolin origin. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm (20 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Aridic Haplustalfs 

TYPICAL PEDON: Hebbronville loamy fine sand, on a south facing, convex, 1 percent slope in rangeland; elevation is 206 m (675 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A1--0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; many roots; many fine pores; neutral, clear smooth boundary. 

     A2--8 to 38 cm (3 to 15 in); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; many roots; many fine pores; neutral; gradual wavy boundary. (combined thickness of the A horizon is 25 to 38 cm [10 to 15 in] thick)

     Bt--38 to 97 cm (15 to 38 in); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; patchy clay films on faces of peds and in pores; few roots; many fine pores; 1 percent threads and films of calcium carbonate in lower part; slightly alkaline; diffuse wavy boundary. (46 to 69 cm [18 to 27 in] thick)

     Btk--97 to 152 cm (38 to 60 in); light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; structureless; soft, friable; 2 percent masses of calcium carbonate; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual wavy boundary.  (36 to 76 cm [4 to 30 in] thick)

     Bk--152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in); very pale brown (10YR 7/4) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; structureless; slightly hard, friable; 2 percent masses of calcium carbonate; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Jim Hogg County, Texas; from the intersection of Texas Highway 16 and Farm Road 649 in Randado; 4.3 miles south on Farm Road 649; 50 feet west in a rangeland.  Randado, Texas USGS topographic quadrangle; Latitude: 27 degrees, 1 minute, 0 second N.; Longitude: 98 degrees, 53 minutes, 51 seconds W.; NAD 83. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil Moisture: An ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic. The soil moisture control section remains moist in some or all parts for less than 90 consecutive days in normal years. The soil is driest during the months of June through August and December through February. These soils are intermittently moist in September through November and March through May. 

Mean annual soil temperature: 22 to 24 degrees C (72 to 76 degrees F)
The solum thickness is more than 203 cm (80 in). 
Secondary carbonates occur at a depth of 36 to 152 cm (14 to 60 in).

Brennan and Willacy soils: have a fine-loamy  particle-size control section. 
Comitas soils: have sandy epipedons thicker than 51 cm (20 in).
Eva, Fragua, and Vona soils: are in a mesic soil temperature regime.
McAllen soils: do not have an argillic horizon, have a fine-loamy particle-size control section, and are calcareous throughout. 
Spantara soils: are in a thermic soil temperature regime.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: eolian sands over calcareous loamy alluvium.
Landform: vegetated sand sheet
Slope: 0 to 5 percent.
Mean annual temperature: 22 to 23 degrees C (72 to 74 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Brennan, Comitas, Escobas, McAllen, Willacy, and Ramadero series. 
Brennan and McAllen soils: occur on similar positions.
Comitas soils: have sandy surfaces more than 51 cm (20 in) and are on higher positions.
Escobas soils: have a mollic epipedon and are on slightly lower positions.
Ramadero soils: occur in weakly expressed drainageways and have mollic epipedons thicker than 51 cm (20 in).
Willacy soils: have mollic surfaces and are on slightly lower positions. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than one percent and very low on slopes 1 to 5 percent.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat, but a few areas are used for crop production. Native vegetation consists of four-flower trichloris, Arizona cottontop, Plains bristlegrass, hooded windmillgrass, pink pappusgrass and woody shrubs such as mesquite, pricklypear, Texas ebony, tasajillo, and granjeno. The ecological site is Sandy Loam, 25-35 PZ (R083EY702TX).
