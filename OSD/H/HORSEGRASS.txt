HORSEGRASS SERIES

The Horsegrass series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on drainageways, flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous Calcic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Horsegrass clay loam, in irrigated pastureland (colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

    Oe--0 to 6 cm; mucky peat; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 cm thick)

    A--6 to 45 cm; black (10YR 2/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 2 percent distinct manganese masses in matrix and 25 percent faint masses of reduced iron in matrix; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary. (25 to 40 cm thick)

    Bk--45 to 90 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; moderately hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 2 percent distinct manganese masses in matrix and 15 percent faint masses of reduced iron in matrix; 10 percent gravel; 15 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (30 to 55 cm thick)

    BCk1--90 to 120 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; 5 percent irregular carbonate masses in matrix; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (20 to 40 cm thick)

    BCk2--120 to 200 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) very gravelly coarse sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 35 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).
