HATRANCH SERIES

The Hatranch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  The Hatranch soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hatranch silty clay loam-rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and very plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine and medium tubular pores; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    C1--4 to 16 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) silty clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine through medium roots; common fine tubular pores; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear irregular boundary.  (10 to 14 inches thick)

    C2--16 to 33 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine through medium roots; few very fine tubular pores; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) relict mottles; noneffervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (14 to 20 inches thick)

    Cy--33 to 60 inches; light gray (5Y 7/2) silty clay, light olive gray (5Y 6/2) moist; strong medium angular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; common fine gypsum crystals; noneffervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Yavapai County, Arizona; located about 1340 feet south and 2955 feet west of the northeast corner of sec 20, T. 13 N., R. 5 E.; 34 degrees, 30 minutes, 24.6 seconds north latitude and 111 degrees, 50 minutes, 35.0 seconds west longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature:  62 to 65 degrees F.

Rock Fragments:  Averages less than 5 percent in the particle-size control section

Clay content:  Averages 30 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section

Calcium carbonate equivalent:  2 to 30 percent

Gypsum content:  10 to 35 percent by weight

Redoximorphic features:  Highly variable throughout and are related to the past lacustrine environment.

A horizon
Hue: 2.5Y, 10YR
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist
Electrical Conductivity:  0 to 2 dS/m

C horizons
Hue:  5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR
Value:  5 through 7, dry or moist
Chroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist
Textures:  silty clay, silty clay loam
Electrical conductivity:  2 to 8 dS/m

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lacita (NM) series. Lacita soils formed in sediments derived from redbed formations and have hues 7.5YR and redder. In addition, Lacita soils are in LRR-G MLRA 70 and are more moist in May and June.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hatranch soils are on fan remnants.  They formed in residuum from gypsiferous lacustrine sediments of the Verde Formation.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 3000 to 4000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ryallen and the Bewearze soils.  Ryallen soils have an argillic horizon and are clayey-skeletal.  Bewearze soils are coarse-silty and have a cambic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hatranch soils are used for urban land and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation consists of canotia, mesquite, mimosa, algerita, scattered juniper, cliffrose, threeawn, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Arizona.  Hatranch soils are of very little extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRAs 38 and 40.  The name is derived from a nearby ranch.
