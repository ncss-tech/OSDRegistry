HOBCAW SERIES

The Hobcaw series consists of deep, very poorly drained,
moderately permeable, loamy soils that formed in marine or fluvial sediments on the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Typic Umbraquults

TYPICAL PEDON: Hobcaw loam--forested. (Colors are for moist soil.)

     A--0 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam; moderate fine
granular structure; friable; many fine and medium roots; few fine holes; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 15
inches thick)

     E--10 to 18 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) sandy loam; weak fine granular structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; few fine holes; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)

     Btg1--18 to 36 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay loam;
common medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) mottles;
moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few faint
clay films on faces of some peds and in old root channels; few
fine and medium roots; few fine holes; strongly acid; clear
smooth boundary.

     Btg2--36 to 46 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay loam;
common fine and medium distinct brownish yellow (10YR 6/8)
mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few
faint clay films on faces of some peds; few fine roots; few fine holes; pockets of sandy clay and loamy sand; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Btg horizon is 15 to more than 50 inches.)

     2Cg--46 to 65 inches; light gray (10YR 7/1) sand; single grained; loose; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  Georgetown County, South Carolina; 3 miles west of the center of the town of Georgetown on U.S. Highway 17 to
entrance to Hobcaw Plantation; south on Hobcaw Road to
intersection of Hobcaw Road and road to Strawberry Village; 0.5
mile beyond intersection on Hobcaw Road.  Site is 25 feet west of center of Hobcaw Road.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is very strongly acid to
slightly acid in the solum and extremely acid to neutral in the Cg horizon.  Few to common fine flakes of mica or fine black minerals are in the lower part of the B and C horizons of some pedons.  The mineralogy of the clay fraction is mixed.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value
of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The E horizon, where present,
has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and
chroma of 0 to 2.  The A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or the mucky analogues of these textures.

The AB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.

The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 2
to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow,
or red range from few to many in most pedons.  It is sandy clay
loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons, less than 6 inches thick, of sandy clay.

The BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Mottles in shades
of red, brown, yellow, or gray range from few to many in most
pedons.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.

The 2Cg or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, 5GY, 5G, or it is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Mottles in shades
of gray, brown, yellow, or red are in most pedons.  In some pedons the Cg horizon is mottled in these colors.  Texture is variable, ranging from sand to stratified clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  These include Paxville series in the same
family and Bayboro, Byars, Cape Fear, Deloss, Hyde, Lumbee,
Pantego, Pocomoke, Portsmouth, and Rains series in similar
families.  Paxville soils have clay mineralogy dominated by kaolinite.  Bayboro, Byars, and Cape Fear soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Bayboro and
Cape Fear soils, along with Deloss and Hyde soils, have mixed mineralogy.  Lumbee, Pocomoke, and Portsmouth soils have a thinner solum.  Pantego and Rains soils do not have a clay decrease of 20 percent or more within 60 inches of the surface.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hobcaw soils are on nearly level and slightly depressional areas below about 40 feet in elevation.  The soils formed in loamy marine or fluvial sediments.  Near the type
location the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches; and freeze-free season is about 243 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Cape Fear series, and Bladen, Chipley, Chisolm, Coosaw, Seabrook, Williman, Yauhannah, and Yemassee series.  Cape Fear and Bladen
soils are on adjacent landscapes and are clayey.  Chipley,
Chisolm, Coosaw, Seabrook, Williman, Yauhannah, and Yemassee soils are on higher landscapes and have an ochric epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Runoff is ponded
or very slow.  Permeability is moderate.  The water table is above
or near the surface for 3 to 6 months in most years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the acreage is in forest; and the
native vegetation consists of sweetgum, blackgum, water tupelo, cypress, water and willow oaks, and undergrowth of bay bushes, myrtle, and gallberry.  Cleared and drained areas are used principally for growing corn, soybeans, small grain, truck crops,
and pasture.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina
and possibly Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina.  The series is
of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Hobcaw soils were formerly included in the Deloss or Paxville series.  This series is limited to soils with mixed mineralogy.
