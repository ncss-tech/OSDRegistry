HASTINGS SERIES

The Hastings series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  Hastings soils are on interfluves and hillslopes on loess uplands in the Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75.  Slopes range from 0 to 17 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters (28 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

When there are secondary carbonates present, the BC and C horizons are now being called Bk horizons to indicate soil development. Bk horizons would have the same properties as described in the Range in Characteristics for the BC and C horizons.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lasita and Longford series.  
Lasita soils have a paralithic contact from 50 to 100 cm.
Longford soils have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR in the argillic horizon.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Precipitation pattern: Precipitation is usually evenly distributed throughout the year with the exception of November through February being the driest months and May and June being the wettest months.  Summer precipitation occurs during intense summer thunderstorms.
Frost-free period: 150 to 178 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Butler, Crete, Fillmore, and Scott soils.  
Butler soils are somewhat poorly drained are on flat or slightly concave depressions
Crete soils are moderately well drained, have greater than 42 percent clay in the PSCS, and occur on similar landform positions.
Fillmore and Scott soils are on closed depressions on loess uplands, pond water during the growing season, and are saturated in the soil moisture control section for longer periods during the growing season.  

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: negligible to medium
Saturated hydraulic conductivity: moderately high 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are cultivated.
Common crops are corn, grain sorghum, winter wheat, soybeans, and alfalfa.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South-central Nebraska and north-central Kansas.  Land Resource Region H, Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region; MLRA 75, Central Loess Plains. Hastings soils are extensive, totaling more than 1,000,000 acres.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Salina, Kansas 

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Adams County, Nebraska, 1923.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:  
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 51 centimeters (0 to 20 inches) (Ap and A horizons) Argillic horizon: 51 to 94 centimeters (20 to 37 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)
Severely eroded Hastings soils no longer classify as Mollisols and will need to be recorrelated to a new series.

Added in clay content and sand content for each horizon. For BC horizon changed reaction from slightly acid to slightly alkaline to neutral to moderately alkaline (based on lab data). For C horizon changed mottles to relict redoximorphic features.
Updated competing series to include Lasita.
Added elevation and FFD to geographic setting and updated landform.
Deleted Holder and Hall from geographically associated soils because don't occur near type location.  Updated the others.
Added LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent. 
Added additional pedons with NSSL characterization data to additional data.

OSD Modification 8/2012 DJK Lowered the depth to carbonates from 91 cm to 80. Added mean annual soil temperature range to RIC. Raised the sand content for the Ap horizon from 15 to 18 percent. Lowered the lower clay content for the Ap from 23 to 21 and raised the upper from 32 to 34 percent. Raised the upper clay content for the BA horizon from 38 to 39 percent. Lowered sand content for the BC horizon from 27 to 24 percent. Added silt loam as possible texture for BC horizon. In RIC, added CCE for the BC and C horizons and added statement about now being Bk horizons. Added precipitation pattern and changed MAP to 26 to 32 inches in the geographic setting. Deleted Massie from geographically associated soils. Changed runoff to include negligible.
