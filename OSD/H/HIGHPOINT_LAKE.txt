HIGHPOINT LAKE SERIES

The Highpoint Lake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments on uplands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow or very slow. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Aquertic Hapludolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Highpoint Lake silty clay - on a nearly level slope in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.) 

    Ap--0 to 10 inches; black (10YR 2/1) silty clay, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; moderate fine and very fine angular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; firm; common fine roots; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. 

    A--10 to 18 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; moderate fine angular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular; firm; common fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 23 inches.) 

    Bw--18 to 25 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) silty clay; moderate fine and medium angular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; neutral; clear smooth boundary. (6 to 20 inches thick) 

    Bk--25 to 53 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silty clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common medium distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/6) redox concentrations; common fine and medium concentrations of calcium carbonates: violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

    C1--53 to 66 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2), silty clay loam; massive; firm; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  

    C2--66 to 80 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) silty clay loam; massive; firm; common medium prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6 and 5/8) redox concentrations; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline. 

TYPE LOCATION: Lyon County, Minnesota; 1500 feet west and 1400 feet north of the southeast corner, Sec. 7, T. 110 N., R. 43 W. ; USGS Dead Coon Lake quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 20 minutes 45 seconds N.; long. 96 degrees 3 minutes 52 seconds W., NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 26 inches. The particle size control section contains 35 to 45 percent clay.  

The A horizon has value of  2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is silty clay, but is silty clay loam  in some pedons. It is slightly acid or neutral. 

The Bw horizon has hue of  2.5Y or 10YR, value of  3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silty clay or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly acid. 

The Bk horizon has hue of  2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is moderately alkaline.  There are common to many redoximorphic features.

The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  There are common to many redoximorphic features. 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Highpoint Lake soils are nearly level to gently sloping on uplands.  Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments of ice-walled lakes. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 27 inches.  Annual frost free days are 120 to 170.  Elevation ranges from 890 to 1950 feet. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fulda and Poinsett soils.  The Poinsett soils are on slightly higher positions on the outer edges of the ice-walled lakes.  The Fulda soils are in lower drainway positions.   

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is .01 to .2 inches per hour. The apparent seasonal high saturation is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches at some time from March to June in normal years.                                            

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated.  The main crops are corn and soybeans. Native vegetation is tall grass prairie.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwestern Minnesota and possibly northeastern South Dakota.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Lincoln County, Minnesota, 2006. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 inches (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 25 inches (Bw horizon); calcic horizon - the zone from 25 to 53 inches (Bk horizon); udic moisture regime.  
This soil would have been included with the Sinai series in the past.
