HIAWATHA SERIES

The Hiawatha series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  They formed in a thin, loamy surface layer containing red, hydrous oxide clays over sandy alluvial deposits on stream terraces.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the loamy surface and high or very high in the rest of the soil. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Typic Udipsamments

TYPICAL PEDON: Hiawatha fine sandy loam - on a 1 percent slope in a forested area. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

	Oe--0 to 5 centimeters; black (5YR 2.5/1) partially decomposed forest litter. (0 to 8 centimeters thick)

	A--5 to 15 centimeters; dusky red (2.5YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, weak red (2.5YR 4/2) dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and medium roots; very strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 13 centimeters thick.)

	2C1--15 to 38 centimeters; brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sand; weak thick platy structure inherent from deposition; very friable; common fine, medium, and coarse roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 38 centimeters thick)

	2C2--38 to 64 centimeters; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sand; weak thick platy structure inherent from deposition; very friable; common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron accumulations throughout are relic redoximorphic features; few fine roots; very strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. (0 to 51 centimeters thick)

	2C3--64 to 140 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand; weak thick platy structure inherent from deposition; few medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron accumulations throughout are relic redoximorphic features; few thin strata 1/16 to 1/2 inches of red (2.5YR 4/6) and black (10YR 2/1) organic stains occur at a depth below 114 centimeters; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 89 centimeters thick)

	2C4--140 to 203 centimeters; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sand; single grain; loose; few medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) iron accumulations; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION: Major Land Resource Area 94B  Michigan Eastern Upper Peninsula Sandy Drift, Schoolcraft County Michigan Subset; about 3 miles east of Smith Lake; 1,400 feet north and 600 feet east of the southwest corner of Sec. 23, T. 43 N., R. 15 W. .; USGS Smith Lake topographic quadrangle; Manistique Township; lat. 46 degrees 6 minutes 14 seconds N. and long. 86 degrees 9 minutes 16 seconds W.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abbeylake, Cantlin, Champlain, Claire, Corliss, Danjay (tentative), Feldtmann, Friendship, Mahtomedi, Menahga, Nymore, Plainbo, Sartell, Serden, Shawano, and Sunday series.
None of these soils allow a loamy red surface layer containing 7 to 15 percent hydrous oxide clays.
Abbeylake, Champlain, Claire, Corliss, Feldtmann, Mahtomedi, Menahga, Nymore, Plainbo, Sartell, Serden, Shawano, and Sunday - do not have water saturation between 152 and 203 centimeters.
Cantlin and Friendship - have water saturation between 107 and 152 centimeters.
Danjay  has bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 centimeters.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material - sandy alluvium
Landform - high stream terraces
Slopes - 0 to 6 percent
Mean annual precipitation - 710 to 810 millimeters
Mean annual air temperature - 3 to 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deford, Duck, Rubicon, Seney and Wurtsmith soils.
Deford and Seney - are in depressions and the Typic Psammaquents subgroup. 
Duck and Wurtsmith - are on slightly lower landscape positions and in the Oxyaquic Udipsamments subgroup.  
Rubicon - are on dunes, or stream bars within the inactive floodplain and on uplands adjacent to the inactive floodplain. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage  water saturation ranges from 152 to 203 centimeters below the surface in October, November, March, April, May, and June (well drained).
Surface runoff - low. 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity - moderately high or high in the loamy surface and high or very high in the rest of the soil.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of this soil is forested.  Major tree species are sugar maple, red maple, American beech, aspen, balsam fir, red pine, and white pine. Common ground plants include shield fern, wild-lily-of-the-valley, low sweet blueberry, starflower, and bracken fern.
