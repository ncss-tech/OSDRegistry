HOEHNE SERIES

The Hoehne series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Hoehne soils are on terraces and flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Ustic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hoehne fine sandy loam, on an east-facing nearly level slope of 1 percent under grass and trees.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches (0 to 8 cm); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches).

    C1--3 to 14 inches (8 to 35 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary.  (6 to 10 inches)

    C2--14 to 34 inches (35 to 86 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 25 inches)

    C3--34 to 44 inches (86 to 112 cm); brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; few faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) concentrations; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common bands of sand and loam material; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.   (10 to 19 inches).

    C4--44 to 60 inches (112 to 152 cm); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Las Animas County, Colorado; about .2 miles west of Trinidad and .1 mile west of I-25 along the north side of the Purgatoire River; 500 feet north and 200 feet east of the southwest corner of section 13, T. 33., R. 64 W.  Latitude 37 degrees, 9 minutes, 56 seconds north, Longitude 104 degrees, 30 minutes, 53 seconds west NAD1983.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Mean annual soil temperature: 50 to 54 degrees F.
Mean summer temperature: 65 to 74 degrees F.
Depth to secondary carbonates: 40 inches or more
Depth to bedrock:  60 inches or more
The estimated organic carbon content of the surface ranges from .6 to 2.0 percent and decreases irregularly with depth.

Particle-size control section:
Clay content:  5 to 18 percent
Silt content: 5 to 40 percent
Sand content: 50 to 75 percent, with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. 
Coarse fragments: 0 to 15 percent but are commonly less than 5 percent.  

A horizon: 
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Reaction: neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 6.6 to 7.8).

C horizon: 
Hue: 2.5Y to 7.5YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Redoximorphic concentrations are common with increasing depth
Texture: highly stratified fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam
Reaction: neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 6.6 to 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES:This is the Cordes(AZ) series.
Cordes soils: have mollic colors to depths of 20 inches or more.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform: terraces and flood plains. 
Slopes:  0 to 2 percent but may range to 6 percent
Parent material: alluvium derived from sedimentary rock
Average annual precipitation: 13 to 16 inches
Mean annual air temperature: 48 to 54 degrees F.
Elevation ranges from 5500 to 6300 feet
Frost free season: 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Haversid and Mauricanyon series.  Haversid soils are calcareous throughout the control section and are in the fine-loamy family.  Mauricanyon soils have a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid or moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as pastureland, irrigated cropland and irrigated hayland.  Native vegetation is mainly bluestems, Indian ricegrass, blue grama, plains cottonwood and willows.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Colorado.  LRR G, MLRA 69; The soils of this series are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Las Animas County, Colorado, 2007.

REMARKS:  
Particle size control section: 10 to 40 inches. (A, C1, C2 and part of the C3 horizons)
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 3 inches. (A horizon)
Fluventic features: irregular decrease in organic matter.
Aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.

Remarks: Name is taken from a small town near the Purgatoire River in Las Animas County, Colorado.  Last updated by the state 12/89.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.  WAW/LAN 4/2006  Added moderately rapid permeability.
