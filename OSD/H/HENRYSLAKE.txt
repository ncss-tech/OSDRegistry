HENRYSLAKE SERIES

The Henryslake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium on outwash plains.  Dominant vegetation is grasses and sedges.  Permeability is moderately slow. Average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 45 days.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Argic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Henryslake gravelly loam in rangeland on a 1 percent southeast facing concave slope at 6350 feet elevation.  When described on September 11, 1980 this soil was saturated to the surface and the water table was at 23 inches.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; common fine distinct yellowish red (5YR 5/6) moist redox concentrations; massive; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and many very fine roots; 20 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (3 or 4 inches thick).

    Btl--3 to 10 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; common medium prominent dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist redox concentrations; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many fine tubular pores; common distinct clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bt2--10 to 23 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; common medium prominent dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3) moist redox concentrations; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; few faint clay films in pores; 35 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 13 inches thick)

    2C--23 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mixed, extremely gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) mixed, moist; many large distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist redox concentrations; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; 65 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7).

TYPE LOCATION:  Fremont County, Idaho; approximately 12 miles south and 10 miles west of Henrys Lake, about 650 feet west, 700 feet north of the southeast corner of section 22, T.13N., R.41E.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Henryslake soils are on undulating outwash plains.  They have formed in mixed alluvium.  The water table is apparent and does not drop below two feet at any time during the year.  Elevations range from 6,300 to 6,600 feet.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.  Moisture is dominantly in the form of snow.  A minor amount falls as rain during the months of May through September.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bootjack, Fourme, Raynoldson, Shotgun, and Tepete soils.  Bootjack soils are on adjacent wet sites and lack a mollic epipedon.  Fourme soils are on drier sites lacking a water table and redox features.  Raynoldson soils are on well drained outwash plains and are pachic, but have no argillic horizons.  Tepete soils are organic soils and occur in peat bogs between bodies of water and well drained soils.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Slow runoff.  Moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Wildlife includes sandhill crane, swan, curlew, song birds, elk, deer, moose, and antelope.  Potential native vegetation consists of tufted hairgrass, wildrye, mountain brome, and sedges.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Fremont County, Idaho, 1989.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and properties recognized are:

Mollic epipedon - the upper 10 inches (A and Bt1 horizons).

Argillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 23 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).

Particle-size control section - the whole argillic horizon from 3 to 23 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).  Coarse fragment content weighted average is always 35 percent or more.
