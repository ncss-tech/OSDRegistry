HEXIE SERIES

The Hexie series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from gneiss and/or granitoid rocks. Hexie soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 18.5 degrees C (65 degrees F). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dovecanyon (CA), Friedliver (CA), Goldivide (CA), Goldpeak (CA), Helendale (CA), Jumborox (T CA), Littlefargo (T CA), Searchlight (NV), Sonoita (AZ+NM), Tray (CA), and Wingap (CA) series.  The Dovecanyon, Friedliver, Goldivide, Goldpeak, Helendale, Jumborox, Searchlight, Sonoita, and Tray soils are all very deep soils and do not have a paralithic contact within 150 centimeters. Wingap soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 centimeters, and a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 18 degrees C. Goldpeak, Jumborox and Littlefargo soils also have a mean annual soil temperatures of 15 to 18 degrees C. In addition, Sonoita soils are moist greater than 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms. Friedliver soils have an upper boundary to the argillic between 25 and 50 centimeters, and Goldivide soils within 50 to 100 centimeters. Dovecanyon, Goldpeak, and Wingap soils do not have secondary carbonates within the series control section, while Tray soils are strongly to very strongly alkaline in all parts and have an argillic horizon with an ESP of 15 to 30. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hexie soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from gneiss and/or granitoid rocks. Elevations range from 700 to 1200 meters (2,300 to 3,935 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 175 millimeters (4 to 7 inches); mean annual air temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C. (63 to 68 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 270 to 320 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Desertqueen and Ironped soils. Desertqueen soils are on similar landscape positions and are shallow to weathered bedrock. Ironped soils are on similar landscape positions, do not have an argillic horizon and are shallow to a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity above the bedrock and moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity within the bedrock. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for recreation and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly burrobush, Parish's goldeneye, big galleta, creosote bush, white ratany, and waterjacket. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. These soils are of small extent.
