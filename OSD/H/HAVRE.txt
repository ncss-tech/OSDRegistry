HAVRE SERIES 

The Havre series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified, calcareous, loamy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Aridic Ustifluvents 

TYPICAL PEDON:  Havre loam, in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted). 

    Ap--0 to 8 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick) 

    C1--8 to 36 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam consisting of thin strata of fine sandy loam, silt loam, and clay loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common to many medium and fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (18 to 30 inches thick) 

    C2--36 to 60 inches; light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) loam consisting of thin strata of clay loam, fine sandy loam, and silt loam, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few fine and very fine roots; common medium and fine pores; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).
