HAYESTON SERIES

The Hayeston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Hayeston soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, beach terraces, and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Xeric Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hayeston sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate medium platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine and very fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 15 cm thick)

    C1--10 to 41 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (28 to 71 cm thick)

    C2--41 to 69 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and very fine roots, common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 48 cm thick)

    2C1--69 to 117 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine interstitial pores; 55 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.  (28 to 90 cm thick)

    2C2--117 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) extremely gravelly loamy sand, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common fine and very fine interstitial pores; 65 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; approximately 12 miles northwest of Eureka; about 1,100 feet north and 1,500 feet east of the southwest corner of section 23, T. 20 N., R. 51 E.; USGS Hay Ranch 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 39 degrees 35 minutes 32 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 12 minutes 14 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.5927778 latitude, -116.2038889 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry; moist in winter and early spring, aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Depth to unconformable 2C horizon:  64 to 100 cm.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.
Other features:  Slightly effervescent  through strongly effervescent in the upper part and strongly to violently effervescent in the lower part.  Some pedons are noneffervescent to a depth of 15 cm.

Particle- size control section - Clay:  5 to l8 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent in the upper part and 35 to 60 percent in the lower part with an average of 15 to 35 percent.

A horizon
Value:  5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Structure:  Platy subangular blocky, or it is massive.
Consistence:  Soft of slightly hard, very friable or friable.

C horizon
Texture:  Fine sandy loam, sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam.
Clay content:  5 to l8 percent.
Rock fragments:  0 to 35 percent mainly gravel.

2C horizon
Value:  7 or 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand, in the upper part and extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly  sand in the lower part.
Clay content:  5 to l0 percent.
Structure:  It is massive or single grained.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Shipley series.  Shipley soils have dominantly silt loam or very fine sandy loam textures and lack an unconformable very gravelly layer within 100 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hayeston soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, beach terraces and beach plains.  These soils formed in lake sediments and alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,770 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to l00 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lien and Umil soils.  These soils are shallow to an indurated duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Irrigated cropland, livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, needleandthread, bottlebrush squirreltail, and bluegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central and eastern Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 28B.
