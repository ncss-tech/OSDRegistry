REMARKS:
Classification was changed from medial-skeletal Andic Cryochrepts to medial-skeletal, amorphic Typic Haplocryands after the Andisols soil order was added to Soil Taxonomy

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon
*Ochric epipedon
*Cambic horizon--zone from 20 to 61 cm
*Andic soil properties--zone from 8 to 89 cm
*Volcanic glass--zone from 8 to 89 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 8 to 89 cm
*Depth to lithic contact--89 cm

07/2016--Assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed enough ash is present in the soils in Willamette National Forest for them to meet criteria 3. Additional samples of the Holderman soils from Douglas County and the Willamette National Forest should be collected to determine whether the soils meet the criteria for the Alic subgroup and whether volcanic ash is in the soils in Lane County.
