HATLIFF SERIES

The Hatliff series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are on natural levees and point bars.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but mainly less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Fluventic Dystrudepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hatliff fine sandy loam- woodland.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Bw4--105 to 190 cm, (41 to 75 in); pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; very friable; common fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; 1 percent medium  distinct iron depletions with clear boundaries in matrix surrounding redox concentrations and 2 percent fine prominent reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron with clear boundaries in matrix; 1 percent medium silica concretions; very strongly acid ; common fine masses of  gray (10YR 6/1) loamy sand along root channels; gradual smooth boundary.   

    Bw5--190 to 203 cm, (75 to 80 in); brown (7.5YR 4/4) loamy sand; massive structure; very friable; common very fine roots throughout; common fine tubular pores; very strongly acid; few strata of light brownish gray(10YR 6/2) sand.

Alonemill, Gladden, Tiogoa, and Wirt soils: in a mesic soil temperature regime; superactive CEC to clay class
Iulus soils: are moderately well drained; have aquic conditions in theupper part.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Gowker (TX) , Hatliff (TX), Kaman (TX),  Kian (TX), Nahatche (TX), Pluck (TX),  and Voss (TX)  series. 
Gowker soils: a mollic epipedon; on a higher position on the same landform
Kaman soils: are clayey throughout
Kian soils: are in a coarse-loamy family; on a lower position on a similar landform
Nahatche soils: are somewhat poorly drained; on a similar landform
Pluck soils: are poorly drained; on a lower position on a similar landform
Voss soils:  sandy throughout; bars adjacent to stream channels.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  well drained. Runoff is negligible. Occasionally or frequently flooded for very brief to long periods in normal years.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the soils are in native forest of pine and hardwood trees.  The principal use is woodland grazing and timber production.  The main vegetation is loblolly pine, water oak, willow oak, red oak, sycamore, sweetgum, American beautyberry, wild grape, berry vines, yaupon, pepper vine, longleaf uniola, beaked panicum, and switchgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana; Land Resource Region T; MLRA 152B; the series is of moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Temple, Texas

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Harris County, Texas; 1973.

REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Iulus series. The series was separated based on taxonomy and climate. The type location was moved from Harris County to Polk County, Texas during the update of MLRA 152B. The Harris County location was not central to the majority of the map units and was experiencing the influence of urban encroachment.  The classification was changed from entisols to inceptisols due to the presence of a cambic horizon in most pedons. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in) (A horizon)

Cambic horizon- 8 to 203 cm (3 to 80 in) (Bw horizons

ADDITIONAL DATA:  Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data pending on pedon S12TX3731025 from the type location in Polk County, Texas and from S2012TX2017130 (lab pedon number 12N8315) from Harris County.  Soil Survey office lab data available on 5 pedons.
