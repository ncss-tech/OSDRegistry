HOODLING SERIES

The Hoodling series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or outwash.  Hoodling soils are on scarps on dissected pediments or outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Park County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, 2010. The name is coined.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section: The zone from 0 to 60 inches.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 5 to 24 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons)
Mollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 8 inches. (A, Bt1 horizons)
Argillic horizon: The zone from 5 to 24 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Btk horizons)Secondary calcium carbonate:  The zone from 17 to 60 inches. (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)
Calcic horizon: The zone from 17 to 24 inches. (Btk horizon)

3/2005: Classification was revised from Ustic to Calcic Argicryolls due to the presence of a calcic horizon.
