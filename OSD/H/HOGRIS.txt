HOGRIS SERIES

The Hogris soils consist of deep and very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium.  Hogris soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 20 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hogris very cobbly sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 1 inch; partially decomposed pine needles and leaf litter.

    A--1 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very cobbly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 30 percent cobble, 25 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); abrupt wavy boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    C1--5 to 10 inches; pinkish gray (7.5YR 7/2) very cobbly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable,  nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular pores; 35 percent cobble, 20 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 8 inches thick)

    C2--10 to 28 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) very cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 40 percent cobble, 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 30 inches thick)

    C3--28 to 60 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 40 percent cobble, 10 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0).  (14 to 30 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION:  Cochise County, Arizona; approximately 1 1/2 miles southwest of Gate 7, Fort Huachuca Military Reservation; 2,640 feet west and 1,980 feet south of the northeast corner of section 10, T. 23 S., R.  19 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February. Driest during May and June.  Typic ustic soil moisture regime.

Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 85 percent in the control section; can have more or less in anyone subhorizon.

Organic matter: Less than 1 percent

Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

A horizon
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value:  3 through 6 dry, 2, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma:  1 through 3, dry or moist

C horizon
Hue: dominantly 7.5YR, 10YR; includes 5YR
Value: 4 through 8 dry, 4, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 2, 3 or 4, dry or moist
Texture: sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam (less than 18 percent clay)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hogris soils are on hills and mountains at elevations of 5600 to 7,700 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 30 to 60 percent and range from 15 to 80 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium weathered from rhyolite, tuff, fine-grained sandstone, siliceous schist, and quartzite.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 200 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Faraway, Luzena, and Tortugas soils.  Faraway, Luzena, and Tortugas soils have mollic epipedons and have a lithic contact at depths of 20 inches of less.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Chihuahua pine, limber pine, Apache pine, pinyon pine, juniper, manzanita, oak, Arizona madrone, Douglas-fir, and white fir with an understory of deergrass, little bluestem, plains lovegrass, wolftail, and sideoats grama.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Cochise and Santa Cruz Counties, Arizona.  These soils are inextensive.  MLRA is 41.
