HAFLING SERIES

The Hafling series consists of shallow well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over fractured basalt bedrock on rolling mountain sideslopes and ridges.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  ashy, glassy, frigid Lithic Vitrixerands

TYPICAL PEDON: Hafling gravelly ashy sandy loam, upland forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	Oi--0 to 1 inche; slightly decomposed pine and fir litter

	A1--1 to 4 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong very thin and thin platy stucture; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular and irregular pores; 10 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

	A2--4 to 13 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) cobbly ashy sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; many very fine and fine irregular and continuous tubular pores; 15 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

	2R--13 to 25 inches; fractured basalt
