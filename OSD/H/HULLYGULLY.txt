COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kindig, Mayacama, Neuns, and Sheetiron series.  Kindig soils are 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) to paralithic contact.  Mayacama, Neuns, and Sheetiron soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) to a lithic contact.   

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on low mountain slopes, landslides, and colluvial fans with slopes of 2 to 75 percent at elevations of 17 to 1200 meters (56 to 3937 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist and phyllite.  The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 5 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 18 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C (55 to 59 degrees F). Frost-free season is 150 to 250 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Burroin and Bagaul soils.  Burroin soils are moderately deep to highly fractured schist.  Bagaul soils are very deep and have an argillic horizon. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; high runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production, wildlife habitat and watershed.  Native vegetation is Douglas-fir, tanoak, Pacific madrone, with an understory of salal, Cascade barberry, poison oak, and bracken fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskiyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. These soils are of small extent.
