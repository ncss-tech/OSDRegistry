Greylingcreek soils are excessively drained, lacks a mollic epipedon, and occurs in mountain valleys and moraines.
Haggardcreek soils lack a mollic epipedon, have bedrock within 200cm (79 cm), and occur on hillslopes and mountain slopes.
Hundell soils lack a mollic epipedon, are moderately well drained, and occur on flats and bluffs in till plains and outwash plains.
Swampylakes soils are somewhat poorly drained, have aquic conditions starting between 34 and 40 cm (13 and 16in), and occur on mountain slopes and hillslopes.
