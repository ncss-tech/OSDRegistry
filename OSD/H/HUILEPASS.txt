HUILEPASS SERIES

The Huilepass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite.  Huilepass soils are on fan remnants and barrier beaches.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bairs, Basket, Breko, Chiefrange, Cowgil, Drino, Hefed, Hunewill, Jungo, Kayo, Lithgow, Plush, Schader, Stucky, and Washoe series.

Bairs, Cowgil, Hefed, Hunewill, and Kayo soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during the summer.  Basket and Chiefrange  soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Breko soils have free carbonates in the A horizon and upper part of the Bt horizon and have mean annual soil temperatures of 13 to 15 degrees C.  Drino, Lithgow, and Schader soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Jungo soils have Btk horizons at 10 to 20 cm.  Plush soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Stucky soils have argillic horizons with 27 to 35 percent clay.  Washoe soils have argillic horizons that are 61 to 100 cm thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Huilepass soils are on fan remnants and adjacent barrier beaches.  They formed in alluvium derived from quartzite.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1680 to 2020 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Badena and Izamatch soils. Badena soils have mollic epipedons. Izamatch soils do not have argillic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Huilepass soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and galleta. This pedon is correlated to ecological site R028AY017NV, Shallow Loam 8-10 P.Z.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern Nevada. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 28A.
