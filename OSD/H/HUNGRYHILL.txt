HUNGRYHILL SERIES

The Hungryhill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills and ridges of structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hungryhill gravelly loam, in rangeland on an 18 percent slope at 1,750 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 18 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; weak fine granular structure; very friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 3 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (18 to 40 cm thick)

    Bt--18 to 43 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium prismatic structure; friable, hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many fine roots; many fine irregular and tubular pores; common distinct clay films on ped faces; 40 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (18 to 28 cm thick) 

    BC--43 to 66 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable, hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 45 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt irregular boundary. 

    R--66 cm; indurated rhyolitic tuff.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landform - mountains, mountaintop ridges and hills 
Elevation - 1,550 to 2,290 meters
Slope - 2 to 60 percent
Parent material - colluvium or slope alluvium derived from rhyolite, rhyodacite, or rhyolitic tuff
Climate - long, cold winters; cold, moist springs; short, cool summers
Mean annual precipitation - 305 to 559 millimeters, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain
Mean annual air temperature - 1 to 5 degrees centigrade
Frost-free period - 30 to 70 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bullrey, Euell and Eastridge soils which occur on similar landforms.  Bullrey soils have a mollic epipedon that is 50 to 75 cm thick.  Euell soils are deep to a lithic contact.  Eastridge soils are very deep.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hungryhill soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue with some areas of widely scattered Douglas fir and Rocky Mountain juniper.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hungryhill soils are of small extent in the intermontane basins of central Montana. MLRA 43B.
