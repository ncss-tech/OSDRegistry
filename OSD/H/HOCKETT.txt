HOCKETT SERIES

The Hockett series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and till over residuum derived from granitic rocks. The Hockett soils are on structural benches in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 720 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Packerjohn soils. Packerjohn soils are greater than 150 cm to bedrock, and include a neutral pH and ashy textures.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hockett soils are on linear to concave positions of structural benches on mountain slopes, glacial-valley floors, and and plateaus. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. These soils formed slope alluvium, colluvium, and till over residuum weathered from granite, granodiorite, and, less commonly, metamorphic rocks. Elevation is 1765 to 3175 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 440 to 1375 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 3 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free season is 60 to 165 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dorst and Kanawyer soils. Dorst soils are on linear to convex positions on structural benches and are less than 50 cm to bedrock. Kanawyer soils are formed in colluvium and/or till derived from granite, and are on linear to convex positions on moraines and mountain slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, high to very high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock is low to high.

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used for recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Vegetation is threadleaf sedge, lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, pinemat manzanita, and greenleaf manzanita.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; MLRA 22A. These soils are not extensive.
