HOOKS SERIES

The Hooks series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Hooks soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplocambids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Hooks sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

     A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; thick and very thick platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and roots; common very fine and fine irregular and tubular and few medium vesicular pores; noneffervescent; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

     Bw--2 to 14 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) silty clay loam, very dark brown (7.5YR 2.5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay bridges; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 15 inches thick)

     C1--14 to 46 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) silty clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; common distinct clay bridges; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

     C2--46 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few fine irregular and tubular pores; common distinct clay bridges; few faint pressure faces; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 6.8).  (Combined thickness of the C horizons is 40 to 50 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Cochise County, Arizona; located at a latitude of 31 degrees, 41 minutes, 24 seconds North and longitude of 109 degrees, 07 minutes, 10 seconds West; about 2,700 feet south and 50 feet west from the northeast corner of section 13, Township 20 S, Range 31 E. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September and December - February.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil Temperature - 62 to 69 degrees F.

Rock fragments: less than 30 percent 

Reaction:  slightly acid to moderately alkaline

Clay content: 18 to 35  percent 

Organic Matter: 1 to 2 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Double (NM), La Lande (NM), and Tenneco (AZ) series. Double soils are effervescent throughout. La Lande soils are derived from redbed formations and are in the Pecos-Canadian Plains and Valleys and are more moist in the soil moisture control section in May and June. Tenneco soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate (3 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent) in the lower part.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hooks soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans at elevations of 3,800 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed mixed alluvium. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 230 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altar, Mallet, Riveroad and Guest soils. Altar soils are loamy-skeletal. Mallet soils are coarse-loamy. Riveroad soils are fine-silty. Guest soils are fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hooks soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes sideoats grama, gramas, Arizona cottontop, Mormon tea and snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Arizona.  Hooks soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA is 41.
