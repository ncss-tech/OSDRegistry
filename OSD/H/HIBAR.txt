HIBAR SERIES

The Hibar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone. Hibar soils are on uplands. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Haplustolls 

TYPICAL PEDON: Hibar loam, cropland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine pores; 5 percent flat angular sandstone pebbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6); abrupt boundary. (6 to 7 inches thick) 

    Bw1--6 to 13 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; few worm casts; 5 percent flat angular sandstone pebbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 12 inches thick) 

    Bw2--13 to 22 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium and coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium and fine subangular blocky; hard, friable; slightly sticky and moderately plastic; many fine and very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores and few medium pores; 5 percent flat angular sandstone pebbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.7); abrupt irregular boundary. (3 to 11 inches thick) 

    Bk--22 to 32 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots mainly between peds; many fine and very fine pores and few medium pores; 15 percent flat angular sandstone pebbles; common medium masses of lime; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); diffuse wavy boundary. (6 to 11 inches thick) 

    R--32 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) hard fractured sandstone; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; few fine roots in sandstone fractures; strongly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amor, Azaar, Diagulch, Max, Minnimaud, Peerless, Prospect, Quigley, Shambo, Tansem, Tewfel, Twin Creek, and Yeoman series. The Amor and Azaar soils have a calcic horizon. The Diagulch, Max, Peerless, Prospect, Quigley, Shambo, Tansem, Twin Creek, and Yeoman series lack a lithic contact within 60 inches. Minnimaud soils do not have a cambic horizon and have paralithic materials consisting of fractured shale in the lower part or the series control section. Teweel soils are non calcareous throughout and have paralithic materials consisting of semiconsolidated shale in the lower part or the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hibar soils are on uplands and have slope gradients of 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 4,200 to 4,700 feet. Hibar soils formed in residuum of sandstone bedrock. The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and summers. Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 24 inches. Mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F. The growing season is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The associated Castner series is shallow to sandstone bedrock. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow or medium runoff, moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Hibar soils are used for rangeland, dryland cropland, and pasture. The potential native vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, Idaho fescue, bearded wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Central Montana. Hibar series is inextensive.
