HELPHENSTEIN SERIES

The Helphenstein series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from tuff and basalt with thin surface mantles of eolian sand. Helphenstein soils are on lake terraces and lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Mean annual soil temperature: 8 to 11 degrees C. 
Ochric epipedon thickness: 5 to 38 cm.. 
Depth to base of cambic horizon: 25 to 86 cm. 
Depth to bedrock: Greater than 150 cm. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 30 percent. 
Sand content: 30 to 50 percent sand (mostly fine and very fine sand) with greater than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.

COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in this family. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Helphenstein soils are on lake terraces and lakebeds. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from tuff and basalt with thin surface mantles of eolian sand. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,265 to 1,465 meters. The climate is arid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Icene, Mesman, Reese, and Turpin soils. Icene soils have salic horizons and occur on slightly higher positions on lake terraces. Mesman and Turpin soils are well drained and do not have water tables. Mesman soils have natric horizons. Reese soils have an aquic moisture regime. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; medium or high surface runoff; slow permeability; moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 30 and 100 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) between February and April. Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory. Some phases of these soils are susceptible to occasional or frequent ponding for long duration from December through May with water up to 30 cm deep. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Helphenstein soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is black greasewood, basin wildrye, and inland saltgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeastern Oregon. These soils are moderately extensive. The series concept and main acreage is in MLRA 23, while other acreage occurs in MLRA 24.

Ochric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (An horizon). 
Cambic horizon - The zone from 18 to 41 cm (2Bn1 and 2Bn2 horizons). 
Sodic subgroup feature - The zone from the soil surface to 100 cm (An, 2Bn1, 2Bn2, and 2Bkn1 horizons and part of the 3Bkn2 horizon). 
Identifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 41 to 127 cm (2Bkn1 and 3Bkn2 horizons). 
Endosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 100 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the 2Bkn1 and 3Bkn2 horizons).
