HANEY SERIES

The Haney series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy and gravelly outwash on outwash plains, terraces, and glacial drainage channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Haney loam, on a convex, 0 to 2 percent slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of 255 meters (835 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; 2 percent fine gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary. [8 to 28 cm (3 to 11 inches) thick]

 BE--20 to 41 cm (8 to 16 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; 5 percent fine gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 20 cm (8 inches) thick]

 Bt1--41 to 61 cm (16 to 24 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; many distinct brown (10YR 4/3) clay films on faces of peds; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) iron depletions in the matrix; few fine faint yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; 10 percent gravel; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.

 Bt3--76 to 86 cm (30 to 34 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) gravelly clay loam; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; clay bridging between sand grains; few medium prominent light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions in the matrix; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; 25 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bt horizon is 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 inches).]

 C1--86 to 102 cm (34 to 40 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam; massive; very friable; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 C2--102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly sandy loam; massive; very friable; 30 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bogart, Centerburg, Cygnet, Houcktown, Jenera, Jugtown, Nicely, Passport, Reaville, Scattersville, Swampoodle, Thackery, Tuscola, Vallonia, Vanlue, and Williamstown series. Bogart, Passport, Scattersville, and Swampoodle soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 112 cm (44 inches). Centerburg, Cygnet, Houcktown, Jenera, Nicely, Tuscola, Vallonia, Vanlue, and Williamstown soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Jugtown soils have rock fragments of sandstone, chert, and shale. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Thackery soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haney soils are on outwash plains, terraces, and glacial drainage channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in loamy and gravelly outwash overlying gravelly, loamy, and sandy outwash material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Belmore, Digby, and Millgrove soils that form a toposequence with the Haney soils. The well drained Belmore soils are on higher topographic positions than Haney soils. The somewhat poorly drained Digby soils and the very poorly drained Millgrove soils are on lower topographic positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1.0 foot to 2.0 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high or very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the underlying material.

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, and hay, with some tomatoes and sugar beets. Native vegetation is deciduous hardwood forest.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Ohio and eastern Indiana; MLRAs 111A, 111B, and 111E. The type location is in MLRA 111E. The series is of moderate extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Paulding County, Ohio, 1957.

REMARKS: With the 7/98 OSD revision, the typical pedon of Haney soils was transferred to Wyandot County and the series will be used only in MLRA 111. Haney soils in MLRA 99 are being converted to Cygnet or Shawtown series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 41 cm (Ap, BE horizons).
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 41 to 86 cm (Bt horizon).
Aquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below the ochric epipedon.
