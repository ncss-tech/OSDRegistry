HAJISHO SERIES

The Hajisho series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone over residuum weathered from limestone.  Hajisho soils are on summits of plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Hajisho fine sandy loam - rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

 C--0 to 1 inch (0 to 3 cm); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6), moist; 6 percent clay; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 12 percent gravel; violently effervescent, 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.0; abrupt smooth boundary.

 Bk1--1 to 5 inches (3 to 13 cm); very cobbly fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) and strong brown (7.5YR 4/6), moist; 8 percent clay; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; finely disseminated carbonate and common fine carbonate masses in the matrix and coarse carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 10 percent gravel and 25 percent cobble; violently effervescent, 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; moderately alkaline, pH 8.2; gradual wavy boundary.

 Bk2--5 to 14 inches (13 to 36 cm); pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) very flaggy silt loam, pink (7.5YR 7/3), moist; 6 percent clay; strong very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few medium and coarse and common very fine roots; few very fine vesicular and many very fine tubular pores; finely disseminated carbonate and common fine carbonate masses in the matrix and many coarse carbonate concretions on bottom of rock fragments; 25 percent gravel and 15 percent flagstone; violently effervescent, 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; strongly alkaline, pH 8.6.

 R--14 inches (36 cm); unfractured, unweathered limestone bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION: Soil Survey of Little Colorado River Area, Arizona, Parts of Coconino and Navajo Counties; USGS Quadrangle - Coconino Point SE; Geographic Coordinate System: 35 46' 22.08'' north, 111 34' 12.48'' west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soil moisture: Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July - September.  Driest during May and June.   Typic aridic soil moisture regime. 

Soil Temperature: 56 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit (13.1 to 15.0 degrees Celsius)

Particle-size control section clay content: 4 to 18 percent

Rock fragments of the control section: 35 to 85 percent gravels, channers, cobbles, and flagstones

Bk Horizons
Hue: 7.5YR, 10YR
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam
Clay: 5 to 18 percent
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 40 percent
Rock fragments: 35 to 85 percent gravels, channers, cobbles, and flagstones

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crotoncanyon (UT), Hoovers (CO), Rochpah (NV), and Tuffman (NV).  Crotoncanyon, Hoovers, and Tuffman soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle control section.  Rochpah soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September and formed from volcanic bedrock.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hajisho soils are on structural benches and plateaus at elevations of 3,140 to 6,000 feet (958 to 1,829 meters).  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. These soils formed in colluvium derived from limestone over residuum weathered from limestone.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.0 to 14.0 degrees Celsius).  The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cataract (UT), Seeg (AZ), and Tsaya (UT) soils.  Cataract soils have argillic horizon and more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Seeg soils have calcic horizons and are deep.  Tsaya soils have lithic bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches and no calcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low to low runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation includes fourwing saltbush, Ephedra, galleta, Douglas rabbitbrush, blue grama, burrograss.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona. Hajisho soils are of moderate extent. This soil is named after a canyon near the type location.  MLRA is 35.
