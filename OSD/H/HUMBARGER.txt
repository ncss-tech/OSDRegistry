HUMBARGER SERIES

The Humbarger series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains in Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is 660 millimeters (26 inches) in the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Cumulic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Humbarger clay loam in a cultivated field.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

  Ap--0 to 56 centimeters (0 to 22 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; slightly hard, friable; few fine roots; many worm casts; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (51 to 76 centimeters (20 to 30 inches) thick)

  AC--56 to 76 centimeters (22 to 30 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable; thin strata of slightly less clayey layers; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) thick)

  C--76 to 200 centimeters (30 to 79 inches); light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; thin strata of more clayey and less clayey layers; slight effervescence; moderately alkaline.
