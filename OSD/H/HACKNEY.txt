HACKNEY SERIES

The Hackney series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Typic Haplustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hackney loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A1--0 to 3 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic, many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--3 to 8 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--8 to 13 inches; dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary. (5 to 7 inches thick.)

    Cr--13 to 60 inches; semiconsolidated shale.

COMPETING SERIES:

Cuniff (MT) - has horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - sedimentary plains and hills.

Elevation - 3,600 to 6,000 feet.

Slope - 4 to 50 percent.

Parent material - material derived from semiconsolidated shale.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

Frost free period - 70 to 90 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hackney soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Native vegetation is western wheatgrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, antelope bitterbrush, lupine, woods rose, prairie junegrass, and rough fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hackney soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Granite County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1402.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 13 inches (A1, A2, Bw horizons); a paralithic contact at a depth of 13 inches.  Hackney soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
