HOLLYWELL SERIES

The Hollywell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed extrusive igneous rocks.  Hollywell soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplocambids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hollywell gravelly loamy sand--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soils unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 10 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly loamy sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common fine vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); Clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)

    Bw--10 to 30 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 cm thick)

    Bqk--30 to 152 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified very gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; common fine tubular and interstitial pores; 5 percent cobbles; 45 percent gravel; few fine carbonate and silica coats on underside of rock fragments; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4)

TYPE LOCATION:  Nye County, Nevada; about 200 feet west and 2,600 feet north of the southeast corner of section 15, T. 3 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Bellehellen, NV 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 38 degrees 6 minutes 33 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 28 minutes 23 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 38.1090000 latitude, -116.490833 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring; and for 10 to 20 days cumulative during July through September following severe convection storms; typic aridic soil moisture regime.
Mean annual soil temperature: 12 to 15 degrees C.
Depth to base of Bw: 25 to 50 cm.
Reaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: 6 to 12 percent.
Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 60 percent

A horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4 dry or moist.
Effervescence:  Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.

Bw horizon
Value:  5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4.
Texture:  Sandy loam or fine sandy loam.
Rock fragments:  5 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles.
Structure:  Weak to moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky.
Effervescence:  Noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.

Bqk and C horizons
Value:  6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.
Chroma:  3 or 4 moist or dry.
Texture:  Stratified sandy loam to coarse sand.
Rock fragments:  Averages 35 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles.
Effervescence:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Malpais and Whirlo soils. The Malpais and Whirlo soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during July through September.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hollywell soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 1,985 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The formed in alluvium derived mainly from extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate is arid, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm; the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ardivey and Unsel soils.  Ardivey soils have loamy-skeletal argillic horizons.  Unsel soils have a fine-loamy, argillic horizons over weakly cemented subhorizons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing.  The present vegetation is mainly winterfat, fourwing saltbrush; Indian ricegrass, Sandberg bluegrass, galleta and cheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada. MLRA 29. The soils are of small extent.
