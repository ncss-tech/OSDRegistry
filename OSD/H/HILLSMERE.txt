DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:
Drainage Class: Subaqueous drainage
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity: Moderately high to high
Soil Moisture Regime: Peraquic
Soil is permanently submerged / continuously inundated with brackish water. The presence of hyper-sulfidic materials within 50 cm of the soil surface puts these soils at risk for potential acid sulfate soil formation if they are dredged and exposed to the air.

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Areas of this soil are used for recreational fishing, swimming, and boating. Commercial uses include shell fishing and aquaculture.
Dominant Vegetation: Benthic fauna such as clams, blue crabs, and oysters are associated with this soil. Eelgrass (Zostera marina), sea lettuce (Ulva sp.), and horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris) may occur on these soils.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Raleigh, North Carolina.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain sub-estuaries of the western portion of the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Seaboard estuaries of Monmouth County, NJ. MLRA 149A. This series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Anne Arundel County, Maryland, 2022.

REMARKS: This subaqueous series is named for Hillsmere Shores a community located on the South River sub-estuary of Chesapeake Bay said to be where the South River meets the Chesapeake Bay.  Areas of Hillsmere were formerly included with and mapped as water.

Diagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2012):
-Ochric epipedon-the zone from 0 to 45 centimeters (Aseg1 and Aseg2 horizons)
-Peraquic feature-the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters is permanently saturated
-Hyper-sulfidic materials-the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters incubated pH values less than 4.0 after 16 weeks.
-n Value greater than 0.7 - the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters with a moderately fluid to very fluid manner of failure.
