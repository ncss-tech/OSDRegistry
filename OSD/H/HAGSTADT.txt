HAGSTADT SERIES

The Hagstadt series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from consolidated siltstone. These soils are on foothills and terraces of uplands and in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 4 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Udic Haplustepts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Hagstadt silt loam, in coniferous forest. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) 

    0i--0 to 1 inch; undecomposed and slightly decomposed forest litter. 

    A--1 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very thin and thin platy structure; soft, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine pores; 1 percent pebbles; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

    Bw--6 to 22 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; moderate and strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common medium roots and few fine roots; common very fine and fine pores; 5 percent pebbles, 70 percent soft siltstone fragments; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt wavy boundary. (18 to 38 inches thick) 

    Cr--22 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) consolidated siltstone, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; neutral (pH 7.0). 

TYPE LOCATION: Missoula County, Montana; 1,000 feet west and 2,200 feet south of the NE corner of sec. 21, T. 13 N., R. 15 W. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Soil Temperature - 44 to 47 degrees F. 
Moisture control section - approximately between the depths of 4 and 12 inches. 
Depth to consolidated siltstone - 20 to 40 inches. 
Control section - 28 to 35 percent clay 
Base saturation: 60 to 100 percent throughout

A horizon - when mixed to a depth of 7 inches this horizon does not meet the requirements for a mollic epipedon.
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: silt loam or silty clay loam
Clay content: 20 to 30 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent pebbles
Reaction: pH 6.1 to 7.3 

Bw horizon - Value: 6 or 7 dry; 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 3 through 6
Texture: silty clay loam
Clay content: 28 to 35 percent
Rock fragments: 0 to 5 percent hard pebbles and 60 to 75 percent soft siltstone fragments
Reaction: pH 6.1 to 7.3 

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hagstadt soils are on foothills and terraces of uplands and in intermountain valleys. Elevations are 3,500 to 4,000 feet. Slopes are 4 to 25 percent. These soils formed in material derived from consolidated siltstone. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Hadstadt soils are used for timber production, homesite development, woodland grazing, and recreation. The native vegetation is ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir with an understory of pinegrass, elk sedge, and common snowberry. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hagstadt soils are of small extent in western Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Missoula County, Montana, 1985. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 6inches (A, Bw horizons); 
Cambic horizon from 6 to 22 inches (Bw horizon);
Particle-size control section from 10 inches to 22 inches (Bw horizon).
Paralithic contact at 22 inches (top of Cr horizon);
Hagstadt soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
