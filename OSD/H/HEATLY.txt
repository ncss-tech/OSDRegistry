HEATLY SERIES

The Heatly series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian sands over loamy eolian deposits and/or alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on sand sheets on stream terraces of dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, active, thermic Arenic Paleustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Heatly fine sand, in rangeland.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; Permeability is rapid in the surface and moderate in the subsoil. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for rangeland. Grasses are tall and midgrasses, mainly bluestem and giant dropseed; woody plants are Havard Oak and some widely separated yucca and sandsage. Some areas are cropped to cotton, grain sorghum, and peanuts.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Land Resource Region - H; MLRA - 78B and 78C (Central Rolling Red Plains, Western and Eastern Parts). The series is of moderate extent.
