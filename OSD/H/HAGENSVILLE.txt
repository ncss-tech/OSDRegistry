HAGENSVILLE SERIES

The Hagensville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on end moraines, drumlins, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, semiactive, frigid Aquic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hagensville fine sandy loam, on a northeast-facing, 1 percent slope in a cultivated field. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (8 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable; common fine and very fine roots; about 3 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) thick]

 Bw--20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common fine prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) masses of oxidized iron; about 3 percent gravel and cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) thick]

 C1--30 to 96 cm (12 to 38 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam; massive; friable; common medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) iron depletions; common fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 10 percent gravel and cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [15 to 127 cm (6 to 50 inches) thick]

 C2--96 to 152 cm (38 to 60 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam; massive; friable; common fine distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) masses of oxidized iron; about 10 percent gravel and cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Presque Isle County, Michigan; about 3 miles southeast of Hagensville; 780 feet west and 40 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 6, T. 33 N., R. 6 E., Posen Township; USGS Posen, MI 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; lat 45 degrees 17 minutes 26 seconds N and long. 83 degrees 44 minutes 36 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Thickness of the solum: 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches)

A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 2, 2.5, or 3
Chroma: 1 or 2
Texture: loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam 
Rock fragment content: 1 to 10 percent gravel and cobbles

Some pedons have BA horizons and BC horizons.

C horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR to 2.5Y
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: commonly sandy loam but includes fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogues of these textures; some pedons have thin lenses of sand, loamy sand, or gravelly sand 
Rock fragment content: 5 to 20 percent gravel and cobbles 
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hagensville soils are on ground moraines, end moraines, and drumlins of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The Hagensville soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cheboygan, Emmet, Omena and Onaway soils on better drained landscape positions, and the poorly drained Hessel soils in nearby depressions and drainageways.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: About half of these soils have been cleared and are being used for pasture and cropland. The remaining soils are in second growth woodland. Native vegetation is northern hardwood with some white spruce, balsam fir, willow, dogwood and tag-alder.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94C in northern Lower Peninsula in Michigan. The series is of moderate extent.
