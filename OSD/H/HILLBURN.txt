HILLBURN SERIES

The Hillburn series consists of very shallow to shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in burnt sandstone and shale residuum and colluvium.  Hillburn soils occur on hillsides, structural benches, and escarpments on structural benches and have slopes of 2 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Lithic Ustic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON: Hillburn very channery loam, rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)  The surface is covered with 5 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 10 percent channers, 10 percent flagstones, and 10 percent stones.

       A--0 to 2 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 15 percent channers, and 5 percent flagstones; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary. (0 to 6 inches thick)

       C1--2 to 7 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) very channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; few very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 15 percent channers, and 10 percent flagstones; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 17 inches thick)

       C2--7 to 13 inches; light reddish brown (5YR 6/3) very channery loam, reddish brown (5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles, 15 percent channers, and 5 percent flagstones; strongly effervescent; carbonates are disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.

       R--13 inches; Straight Cliffs Formation sandstone bedrock.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Andanada (NM), Daklos (UT), Ednagrey (NV), Meriwhitica (AZ), Nonip (UT), Redsun (WY), Reef (UT), Skos (UT), Sunup (AZ),  Teesto (AZ) and Windcomb (UT) series.
Andanada soils contain 20 to 40 percent calcium carbonates equivalents.
Daklos soils do not have visible secondary calcium carbonates, and 10YR and yellower hues. 
Ednagrey soils have 7 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section.
Meriwhitca soils have hues yellower than 5YR. 
Nonip soils profile is dominated by channers size fragments and has 10YR or yellowier hues.
Redsun and Reef soils clay content average less than 18 percent.
Sunup soils have hue yellower than 5YR and are moist in some part of the control section 3 months proceeding the summer solstice.
Skos soils have soil temperatures that range from 52 to 56 degrees F and contain 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. 
Teesto soils are dominated by cobble size fragments and contain more than 35 percent sand in the particle size control section.
Windcomb soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 50 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material: burned sandstone and shale residuum and colluvium 
Landform: hillsides, structural benches, and escarpments on structural benches 
Elevation: 4,800 to 7,200 feet 
Slope: 2 to 70 percent 
Mean annual temperature: 45 to 52 degrees F 
Mean annual precipitation: 9 to 12 inches 
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sazi, Mivida, and Rizno soils. The Sazi and Mivida soils are greater than 20 inches deep to bedrock. The Rizno soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; rapid runoff; moderate slow to moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used as rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation includes Utah juniper, green mormontea, broom snakeweed, two-needle pinyon, Fremonts Barberry, Indian ricegrass, galleta and roundleaf buffaloberry.  These soils have been correlated to the Semidesert Shallow Loam (Utah Juniper-Pinyon) 035XY221UT ecological site at the type location in Utah.  Also a dry phase has been correlated to Semidesert Shallow Shale (Utah Juniper-pinyon) 035XY234UT ecological site in the soil survey area (Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southeast Utah. The series is of small extent. MLRA 35.
