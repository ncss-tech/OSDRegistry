HOLLOWAY SERIES 

The Holloway series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite rock.  These soils have a large component of volcanic ash in the surface layer.  Holloway soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 

Landform - mountains. 
Elevation - 3,800 to 8,800 feet. 
Slopes - 8 to 80 percent. 
Parent material - colluvium derived from argillite or quartzite. 
Climate - cool with long, cold winters; moist springs. 
Mean annual precipitation - 25 to 60 inches. 
Mean annual temperature - 35 to 43 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Waldbillig soils and the Coerock, Felan, Mitten and Winkler soils. Coerock soils are shallow to a lithic contact. Felan soils do not have horizons containing lamellae. Mitten and Winkler soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and are at lower elevation. These soils are on similar landform positions.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Holloway soils are used for timber production, watersheds, and wildlife habitat.  Potential native vegetation is subalpine fir, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, western larch, and lodgepole pine with an understory of twinflower, blue huckleberry, rusty menziesia, and common beargrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Holloway soils are of large extent in western Montana. MLRA 43A and 46.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Records:  MT0029, MT0748.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 20 inches (Oi, A and 2E horizons); an albic horizon from 13 to 20 inches (2E horizon); a cambic horizon from 20 to 55 inches (2E and Bt horizon); a particle-size control section from 13 to 43 inches (2E, 2E and Bt horizons).  Holloway soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic moisture regime. 

The 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.
