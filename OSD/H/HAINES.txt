HAINES SERIES

The Haines series consists of deep, poorly drained soils on
flood plains and broad alluvial terraces.  They formed in
mixed alluvium with an influence of loess and volcanic ash
in the surface horizons.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The
mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean
annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Typic Endoaquepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haines silt loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes,
pasture.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise
noted.)

2, calcium carbonate of 2 percent; moderately alkaline (pH
8.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 13 inches thick)

2C--30 to 43 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) silt loam,
white (2.5Y 8/2) dry; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky
and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very
fine tubular pores; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual
smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 inches thick)

3C--43 to 60 inches; grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) sandy clay

olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) and olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) mottles;
massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;
common very fine tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8).

TYPE LOCATION:  Baker County, Oregon; located about 4 miles
southeast of Haines, in the SW1/4SW1/4SE1/4 sec. 12, T. 8
S., R. 39 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature
ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are saturated
throughout at some time of the year in most years.  Depth to
the fluctuating water table is 12 to 24 inches from spring
through early summer.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges
from 15 to 35 percent between depths of 0 and 25 inches.
Depth to the 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The
particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay
and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine
sand.  Gravel content is 0 to 10 percent throughout.

The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4
moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is
very strongly or strongly alkaline with lime disseminated
throughout.

The Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or
7 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam,
averaging 12 to 18 percent clay.  It has common to many
distinct or prominent mottles.  It is moderately or mildly
alkaline with lime disseminated throughout the horizon.

The 2C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry and
chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, averaging 7 to
12 percent clay.  It is moderately or mildly alkaline.

The 3C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and
chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam or clay
loam, averaging 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has common to
many distinct or prominent mottles.  It is moderately or
mildly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  The Baldock, Cruickshank, Elpam, Filion, and Rafael series are similar.  Baldock and Filion soils are fine-loamy.  Cruickshank soils are coarse-loamy.  Epham and Rafael soils are fine-silty.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Haines soils occur on flood plains and
broad alluvial terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.
Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,400 feet.  The soils formed
in mixed alluvium with an influence of loess and volcanic
ash in the surface horizons.  The mean annual precipitation
is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50
degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Baldock,
Burkemont, and Umapine soils.  Baldock soils are on adjacent
flood plains in depressional areas, have a fine-loamy
particle-size control section and have pH less than 8.5 in
the surface horizons.  Burkemont soils have a fine-textured particle-size control section.  Umapine soils are somewhat
poorly drained.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderately slow.  A high water table
fluctuates between 12 and 24 inches from February through
May.  Flooding is rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Haines soils are used for
pasture.  The native vegetation is mainly saltgrass, Lemmon alkaligrass, alkali cordgrass, basin wildrye and Baltic
rush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Lower elevation valleys and basins
of central and eastern Oregon.  The series is of small
extent.
