HYNES SERIES

The Hynes series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. They are on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hynes silt loam, cropland - on a 1 percent slope, at 4,180 feet elevation. (When described on October 12, 1993, the profile was dry throughout.  Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    A--0 to 4 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine roots; many fine tubular pores; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 6 inches thick)

    Bk--4 to 16 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent (8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 14 inches thick)

    Bkq--16 to 30 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots; few fine tubular pores; 25 percent durinodes; violently effervescent (20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (10 to 20 inches thick)

    B'k--30 to 41 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate fine platy structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few very fine irregular pores; violently effervescent (24 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 16 inches thick)

    2C1--41 to 53 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; moderate medium platy structure; very hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent (9 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 14 inches)

    2C2--53 to 64 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine irregular pores; strongly effervescent (6 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chijer and Portneuf series. Portneuf soils are silt loam throughout the profile and lack the 2C substratum.  Chijer soils have loam texture in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hynes soils are on terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevation ranges from 4,100 to 4,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 to 10 inches.  The average annual air temperature is about 48 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Portneuf and the Sluka soils.  Sluka soils are moderately deep to a duripan.  Portneuf and Sluka soils occur on higher terraces.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hynes soils are used for irrigated cropland. The principal crops grown are barley. potatoes, sugar beets and wheat.
