HAMACER SERIES

The Hamacer series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian materials derived from mixed rocks that are high in siliceous materials and influenced by volcanic ash and pyroclastic material from tuffs. Hamacer soils are on flood plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Mixed, frigid Haploduridic Torripsamments

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hamacer loamy fine sand - abandoned cropland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

     A--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loamy fine sand, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine and common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 cm thick)

     C--10 to 53 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loamy fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common medium, few fine, and common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2), clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 60 cm thick)

     Cq--53 to 84 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sand, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 50 percent hard, firm, and brittle cylindrical durinodes; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (25 to 60 cm thick)

     C'1--84 to 97 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual smooth boundary.  (0 to 30 cm thick)

     C'2--97 to 152 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial pores; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Eureka County, Nevada; about 150 feet north and 2,950 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 16, T.21N., R.53E.; 39 degrees 40 minutes 49 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees 0 minutes 36 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 39.7119444 latitude, -116.9747222 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  
Soil moisture: Usually dry, moist in winter and early spring months, typic aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.  
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
mean summer soil temperature: 16 to 17 degrees C.  
Depth to the Cq horizon: 40 to 76 cm.  
Mineralogy: Mixed, but is strongly influenced by the siliceous materials in the Vinini Formation, and to some extent by volcanic ash.  
Reaction: Slightly alkaline through moderately alkaline. 

Particle-size control section - Clay content 1 to 5 percent.
Rock fragments: Average 0 to 15 percent.

A horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist. 
Chroma: 2 or 3.  

C horizon
Chroma: 2 or 3.  
Texture: Loamy fine sand or fine sand.

Cq
Texture: Loamy fine sand or fine sand.
Durinodes: 20 to 90 percent 1 to 2.5 cm in diameter and are slightly hard or hard, and brittle.  
Effervescence: Noneffervescent through strongly effervescent.  
Structure: Single grained or massive. 
Matrix consistence: Loose to slightly hard.

C' horizons
Texture: Loamy fine sand or fine sand.
Chroma: 2 or 3.  
Effervescence: Commonly noneffervescent, but may have some calcareous strata in some pedons.  

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Sandgap series.  Sandgap soils have a continuous brittle layer at 38 to 50 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hamacer soils are on flood plains and stream terraces at elevations of 1,770 to 1,860 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial and eolian materials derived from mixed rocks that are high in siliceous materials and influenced by volcanic ash and pyroclastic material from tuffs.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kobeh, Shipley and Silverado soils.  Kobeh soils have gravelly or very gravelly textures throughout the particle-size control section.  Shipley soils have moderately coarse textured calcareous profiles with less than 20 percent durinodes.   Silverado soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections with cambic horizons.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; slow runoff; rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Principally livestock grazing.  Some areas are cropped with small grains and alfalfa as principal crops.  Vegetation is principally big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass and rubber rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Nevada.  Hamacer soils are inextensive, with about 5,500 acres. MLRA 28B.
