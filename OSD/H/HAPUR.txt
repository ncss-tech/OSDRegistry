HAPUR SERIES



The Hapur series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that

formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Hapur soils are on channeled

bottomlands and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.

Permeability is moderately slow in the upper horizons and very rapid in

the lower horizons.  The average annual precipitation is about 14

inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, frigid Typic Calciaquolls



TYPICAL PEDON:  Hapur silt loam--on a 1 percent slope at an elevation

of 4,820 feet in wet meadow pasture.  When described on Spetember 14,

1983, the soils was moist in the upper 6 inches and wet below this

depth.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)



    Ak1--0 to 3 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR

3/1); strong medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly

sticky and plastic; many very fine, fine, and medium roots; many very

fine and fine tubular pores; strong effervescence (about 20 percent

calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary.

(2 to 5 inches thick)



    Ak2--3 to 10 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, very dark

gray (10YR 3/1) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky

structure; slightly hard, friable, sticky and plastic; many very fine,

fine, and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; strong

effervescence (about 20 percent calcium carbonate); moderately alkaline

(pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 10 inches thick)



    Bkg--10 to 15 inches; gray (5Y 6/1) silty clay loam, dark gray (5Y

4/1) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard,

firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots;

common very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly effervescence (about

10 percent calcium carbonate); mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy

boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)



    Cg--15 to 30 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) clay loam, gray (2.5Y

6/1) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; common very fine

and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; mildly

alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (12 to 22 inches thick)



    2Cg1--30 to 44 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) fine sandy loam, gray

(2.5Y 6/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, sticky and slightly

plastic; common very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine

tubular pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary.  (11 to

18 inches thick)



    2Cg2--44 to 51 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/l) loamy fine sand, gray

(2.5Y 6/1) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and

slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine

interstitial pores; mildly alkaline (pH 7.4); gradual wavy boundary.

(5 to 11 inches thick)



    3Cg--51 to 63 inches; light gray (2.5Y 7/1) very gravelly loamy

sand, gray (2.5Y 6/1) moist; single grain, loose; many very fine and

fine interstitial pores; about 40 percent pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH

7.4).



TYPE LOCATION:  Blaine County, Idaho; about 2,600 feet south and 50

feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 23, T. 1 S., R. 19 E.; about

2.5 miles south of Gannett.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:



Depth to high water table - 6 to 12 inches

Depth to sand and gravel - 40 inches or more

Average annual soil temperature - 42 to 47 degree F

Profile effervescence - slight to strong effervescence in the upper 20

inches, noneffervescent below 20 inches



A horizon - has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or

2 dry of moist

Reaction of mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline

Calcium carbonate of 15 to 25 percent



Bkg horizon - has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 1

or 2 dry or moist

Textures of SICL, CL, L

Reaction of neutral to strongly alkaline

Calcium carbonate of 10 to 25 percent



Cg horizon - has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, and value of 6 or 7 dry and

4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 0 to 2 dry or moist

Textures of FSL, LFS, GRV-COS, GRV-LS

Reaction of neutral through moderately alkaline



COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Nortonville and Vallers series.

Nortonville soils have gypsic horizons.  Vallers soils lack a calcic

horizon in the A1 and lack a layer with less than 20 percent clay above

40 inches.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hapur soils occur on level to nearly level

undulating channeled bottomlands and floodplains.  Elevation ranges

from 4,700 to 5,550 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils

formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The average annual temperature

ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is

from 12 to 16 inches and the frost-free period ranges from 60 to 100

days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bickett, Hutton,

Marshdale, and the Picabo soils.  Bickett soils have an organic layer

on the soil surface and are very poorly drained.  Hutton soils have

more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Marshdale soils have

a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and have an irregular

decrease in organic matter with depth.  Picabo soils are calcareous

throughout the control section and are somewhat poorly drained.

Bickett, Marshdale, and Hutton soils occur on the same landscape.

Picabo soils occur on stream terraces.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Permeability of the upper

horizons is moderately slow and very rapid in the lower horizons.



USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for wildlife habitat and wet

meadow pasture.  Natural vegetation includes rushes, sedges, shrubby

cinquefoil, and willow.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is inextensive in Blaine County,

Idaho.
