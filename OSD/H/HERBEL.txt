HERBEL SERIES 

The Herbel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from igneous rocks such as rhyolite, monzonite and andesite.  Herbel soils are on alluvial fans and coalescent fan piedmonts with slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bitterwater (CA), Circular (AZ),  Elkhills (CA), Granitepass (CA), Kimberlina (CA), Machone (CA),  McCullough (NV) and Seaman (NV) series. Bitterwater, Circular, Elkhills, Granitepass, Kimberlina, Machone, McCullough and Seaman soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Herbel soils are on alluvial fans and coalescent fan piedmonts.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 3,700 to 4,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 190 to 220 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Onite, Hachita, Nolam, Agustin, Pajarito, Canutio, Stagecoach, Delnorte and Anthony soils.  Onite, Hachita and Nolam soils have argillic horizons.  Agustin and Pajarito soils have cambic horizons.  Canutio soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Stagecoach soils have calcic horizons and contain more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Anthony soils have more than 0.2 percent organic carbon at a depth of 125 cm and/or organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes creosotebush, tarbush, snakeweed, bush muhly and fluffgrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  South central New Mexico.  Herbel soils are of small extent. This soil occurs in LRR-D, MLRA 42.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Dona Ana County, New Mexico, (Desert Project); 1997. 

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 9 inches (A, Bk1 horizons)

Entisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons

This series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.

Classified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.

When the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the great group of Haplocambids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.
