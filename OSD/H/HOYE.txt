HOYE SERIES

Hoye series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from intermediate and basic volcanic rocks. Hoye soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.

Ackley soils do not have Btk horizons and have nongravelly Bk horizons. Blacknest and Windypoint have lithologic discontinuities of sand and gravel at 50 to 100 cm. Greenbrae soils have lithologic discontinuities at 102 cm and are noncalcareous to 76 cm. Hardtrigger soils have 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate in the Bk horizon. Harsan soils are deep over duripans. Hoosegow, Lankbush and Morfitt soils are noncalcareous to 100 cm or more. Shawave soils have rock fragments with granitic lithology and a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C. Turria soils are noncalcareous to 76 cm or more and C horizons that are stratified very fine sandy loam to silt loam.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoye soils are at elevations of 1,640 to 2,290 meters. Hoye soils are on hillslopes, fan remnants and fan skirts. Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from intermediate and basic volcanic rocks. The climate is semiarid, and the average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C. The mean summer temperature is 20.5 to 22 degrees C, and the freeze-free period is 90 to 140 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Escalante, Hiko Peak, Monroe, and Povertyflat soils. Escalante and Hiko Peak soils do not have argillic horizons and have calcic horizons. Escalante soils are coarse-loamy and Hiko Peak soils are loamy-skeletal. Monroe soils have a mollic epipedon 50 or more cm thick. Povertyflat soils have a mollic epipedon and are loamy-skeletal

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained, medium runoff, moderate or moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for irrigated cropland and livestock grazing. Principal crops are alfalfa, small grains and corn silage. Native vegetation is shadscale, Indian ricegrass, cheatgrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, Russian thistle, and Wyoming big sagebrush. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southwest and central Utah; MLRA 28A. The series is moderately extensive. 

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona.

REMARKS: Classification changed from Xeralfic Haplargid to Xeric Haplargids in 9/94. December 2008, the type location is moved to better represent the series.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 
Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to 13 cm (A horizon). 
Argillic horizon - The zone of clay accumulation from 13 to 43 cm (Bt and Btk horizons). 
Secondary carbonates - The zone of secondary carbonates from 43 to 81 cm (Bk horizon).
Particle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 43 cm (Bt and Btk horizons). 

ADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory pedon number 93P0042 (S82UT041001) is available for the current type location.
