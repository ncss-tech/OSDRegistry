HOOSEGOW SERIES

The Hoosegow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Hoosegow soils are on basalt plains, buttes, terraces, and hills and have slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the mean air temperature is about 47 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hoosegow loam on a 2 percent slope at an elevation of 3,960 feet in rangeland.  When described May 6, 1982, the profile was moist below 3 inches.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 2 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (2 to 4 inches thick)

    A2--2 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse platy structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 6 inches thick)

    BA--7 to 12 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt1--12 to 20 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; few faint clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 10 inches thick)

    Bt2--20 to 37 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on ped faces; neutral (pH 7.2); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 21 inches thick)

    BC--37 to 56 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; about 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); gradual wavy boundary. (12 to 19 inches thick)

    C--56 to 68 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loamy sand, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; single grain; loose; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  Abgese, Ackley, Barasco, Colbar, Greenbrae, Hardtrigger, Hoye,  Morfitt, Nosser, Shawave, Stiles (T), and Turria soils.  Abgese, Ackley, Hardtrigger, Morfitt, Shawave, soils have secondary carbonates (Bk) immediately below the argillic.   Bluelight, Colbar, and Nosser soils are moderately deep to lithic contact.  Greenbrae soils are formed in alluvium from granite, and have more than 40 percent sand which is dominantly medium sand or coarser.  Morfitt and Turria soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Stiles soils have moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline argillic horizons.  Barasco soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F., and have multiple strongly contrasting textural discontinuities.  Hoye soils have a solum thickness of 10 to 20 inches and have carbonates throughout the substratum. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hoosegow soils are on basalt plains, buttes, terraces, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Elevation ranges from 3,300 to 5,075 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains.  The mean annual air temperature is about 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 90 to 140 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Minveno, Potratz, Sidlake, and Snowmore soils.  Both Sidlake and Potratz soils have basalt bedrock between 20 to 40 inches, and Minveno and Snowmore soils have a duripan between 20 to 40 inches.  Sidlake and Potratz soils occur on ridgetops and convex positions.  Snowmore and Minveno soils occur on older buttes and basalt plains, and occupy convex slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, medium runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hoosegow soils are used for rangeland.  The natural vegetation is basin big sagebrush and basin wildrye.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The soils in this series are of small extent; MLRA 11.
