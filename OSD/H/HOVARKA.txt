HOVARKA SERIES

The Hovarka series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Hovarka soils are on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Cumulic Cryaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hovarka loam, on a north facing concave, 1 percent slope in a wet meadow at an elevation of 7,840 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 27, 1996, the soil was moist throughout.

    Oi--0 to 4 inches; slightly decomposed leaves, twigs, and roots.

    A1--4 to 12 inches; very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) dry; weak fine granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and few coarse roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; common medium distinct strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron concentrations; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear smooth boundary (5 to 15 inches thick).

    A2--12 to 32 inches; black (10YR 2/1) loam, dark gray (10YR 4/1) dry; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; many fine distinct brown (7.5YR 5/4) iron concentrations; slightly acid (pH 6.2); clear wavy boundary (10 to 20 inches thick).

    2C1--32 to 36 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) very cobbly loamy sand, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots and many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4);  clear wavy boundary (4 to 10 inches thick).

    2C2--36 to 64 inches; gray (10YR 5/1) very cobbly sand, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; single grain; loose, non sticky and non plastic; few very fine roots and many very fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel and 20 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Summit County, Utah; about 1 mile north of Burts-Miller Ranch; located about 1,800  feet North and 300 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 17, T. 3 N., R. 10 E.; Deadman Mountain, Utah-Wyoming USGS quad; lat. 40 degrees 59 minutes 40 seconds N. and long. 110 degrees 50 minutes 45 seconds W., NAD 1927

Depth to redox concentrations: 0 to 20 inches
Thickness of the mollic epipedon:  16 to 40 inches
Depth to endosaturation: 10 to 20 inches in March through May

Particle-size control section:
Upper part: Clay content: 18 to 27 percent
  Rock fragment content: 0 to 15 percent

Lower part: Clay content: 0 to 10 percent
  Rock fragment content: 35 to 60 percent, dominantly cobble

A horizon:  
Hue:  10YR
Value:  2 or 3 moist; 3 or 4 dry
Chroma:  1 or 2 moist and dry
Rock fragments:  0  to 15 percent
Reaction:  Moderately acid to neutral

2C horizon:
Value:  4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry
Chroma:  1  to 2 moist and dry
Texture:  Stratified very gravelly loamy sand to very cobbly loamy sand
Rock fragments:  35 to 60 percent
Reaction:  Moderately acid to neutral

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kilgore (CO) and Lemhi (T ID) series.
Kilgore: dominantly gravel sized rock fragments in the lower part; the soil moisture regime is bordering on ustic.
Lemhi: has horizons of secondary carbonates and the reaction throughout the soil is slightly or moderately alkaline.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hovarka soils.
Parent material:  Alluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite.
Landform:  Flood plains
Slopes:  0 to 2 percent
Elevation: 7,800 to 9,400 feet
Mean annual air temperature:  35 to 40 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  22 to 35 inches.
  Wettest months:  March through May.
  Driest months:  July through September.
Frost-free period:  20 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Duchesne and Millcreek series.  
  Duchesne:  Well drained soils on mountain slopes
  Millcreek:  Moderately well drained soils in flood plains

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained, slow runoff, moderate over very rapid permeability.  These soils are frequently flooded for brief periods during the months of March through May.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The major uses are rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is sedges, rushes, grass and clover.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North Central Utah  LRR E, MLRA 47.  This series is of minor extent.
