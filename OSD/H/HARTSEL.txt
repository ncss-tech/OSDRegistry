HARTSEL SERIES

The Hartsel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Hartsel soils are on treads of flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists mainly of tufted hairgrass, Nebraska sedge, slender wheatgrass, Baltic rush, and ovalhead sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Central Colorado, LRR E, MLRA 48B; small extent.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 150 cm
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 40 to 115 cm  (part of the Bk2, the Bk3, and part of the 2C1 horizons)
Calcic horizon:  from 15 to 79 cm  (Ak, Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons)
Redoximorphic concentrations:  from 56 to 79 cm (Bk3 horizons)  
Endosaturation:  at 56 to 167 cm (Bk3, 2C1, 2C2, 3C3 horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity (loamy-skeletal layer):  At the upper boundary of the 2C1 horizon. 
Lithologic discontinuity (sandy-skeletal layer):  At the upper boundary of the 3C3 horizon. 

This soil is in climatic area that is considered an ustic moisture regime bordering aridic; however, the seasonal saturation and the capillary fringe is assumed to put this soil more in the middle of the ustic regime.

Taxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010.

ADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon was sampled for the NSSL, soil survey sample number 88CO093007.
