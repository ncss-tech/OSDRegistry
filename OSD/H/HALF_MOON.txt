HALF MOON SERIES

The Half Moon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains, glaciolacustrine stream terraces, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, active, frigid Typic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Half Moon silt loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(0 to 8 inches thick)

    C--33 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very fine sandy loam that has thin lenses of silt loam and silty clay, pale brown (10YR 6/3) moist; massive; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - lake plains, glaciolacustrine stream terraces, and alluvial fans.
Elevation - 2,500 to 4,500 feet.
Slope - 0 to 45 percent.
Parent material - lacustrine deposits.
Climate - cool, with long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 18 to 30 inches, much of which falls as snow or as spring rain.
Mean annual temperature - 38 to 44 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 70 to 105 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Depew, Entente, Haskill, Lubrecht, and Tarkio soils. Depew and Lubrecht soils are fine. Entente soils are coarse-silty and do not have argillic horizons. Haskill soils are coarse-loamy. Tarkio soils are very-fine.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Half Moon soils are used mainly for timber production, woodland grazing, and as wildlife habitat. The potential native vegetation is coniferous forest consisting mainly of grand fir, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, and western larch with an understory of twinflower, queencup beadlily, bunchberry dogwood, dwarf huckleberry, pinegrass, kinnikinnick, common snowberry, white spirea, Oregon grape, white spirea, and elk sedge.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Half Moon soils are of moderate extent in intermountain valleys of western Montana. MLRA 43A and 44A.
