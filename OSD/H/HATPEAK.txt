HATPEAK SERIES

The Hatpeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt, rhyolite and tuff with a small component of loess.  Hatpeak soils are on side slopes of fan piedmont remnants and on plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, frigid Typic Durixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hatpeak loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Bqkm1--75 to 97 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) fractured indurated duripan, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; strong thick and very thick platy structure; very hard, very firm, strongly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick).

    Bqkm2--97 to 150 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) continuous indurated duripan, light gray (10YR 7/2) moist; massive; extremely hard, extremely firm; opal laminae 0.3 to 0.6 cm thick; strongly effervescent, strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; Owyhee Desert, approximately 20 miles north of Wilson Reservoir, about 2,430 feet south and 2,300 feet east of the northwest corner of section 11, T. 47 N., R. 49 E.; USGS Hat Peak 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 41 degrees, 59 minutes, 25 seconds N and longitude 116 degrees, 27 minutes, 09 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.9902778 latitude, -116.4525000 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Moist in winter and spring, dry from mid July through October; aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.
Mean annual soil temperature: 7 to 8 degrees C.
Thickness mollic epipedon: 20 to 38 cm.
Depth to duripan:  50 to 86 cm.
Depth to bedrock:  100 to over 150 cm.

Particle-size control section Clay content:  35 to 50 percent.
Rock fragments:  Up to 15 percent, mainly cobbles.

A horizon
Value:  2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3.
Reaction:  Slightly acid or neutral.

Bt horizon
Value:  3 or 4 moist.
Texture:  Silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam and clay.
Structure:  Prismatic, angular or subangular blocky.
Reaction:  Neutral or slightly alkaline.

Bqkm horizon
Value:  4 through 7 moist.
Chroma:  2 through 4.
Consistence:  Very hard or extremely hard.
Other features:  Some pedons have a strongly silica cemented duripan below the indurated duripan.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Budlewis, Dranket, Forvic, Manard, Oshone, Peevywell and Rastus series. 

Budlewis, Dranket and Manard soils have bedrock at within 100 cm. Forvic soils have mollic epipedons 50 to 75 cm thick and are moderately deep to welded ash. Oshone soils have duripan that are less than 25 cm thick and contain 5 to 25 percent gravel. Peevywell soils are noneffervescent in the duripan and have an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizons. Rastus soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hatpeak soils are on side slopes of fan piedmont remnants and upland plateaus.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite, basalt and tuff with a small component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,590 to 1,895 meters.  Climate is cool and subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Berning, Deunah, Petan, and Susie Creek soils.  Berning and Deunah soils lack a mollic epipedon.   Petan soils are shallow to a duripan.  Berning and Susie Creek soils also lack an indurated duripan.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; slow or medium runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat. Vegetation is mainly basin big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Sandberg bluegrass, and rubber rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada and southwestern Idaho.  Hatpeak soils are of small extent. MLRA 25.
