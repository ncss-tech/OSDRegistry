SERIES ESTABLISHED: Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska; 2020

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons and other features in this pedon
*Particle-size control section--zone from 25 to 100 cm
*Ochric epipedon
*Strongly contrasting particle size
*Lithologic discontinuity--top of 2C3 horizon
*Irregular decrease in organic carbon content--zone from 25 to 55 cm
*Aquic conditions--55 cm and below
Occasional flooding is the dominant condition for this series.
Positive reaction to alpha-alpha-dipyridyl is assumed in the 2C3 horizon.
Low chroma and values of 4 or greater in the 2C horizon are derived from parent material and are not believed to be related to aquic conditions.
