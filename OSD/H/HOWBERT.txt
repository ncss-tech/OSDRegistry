HOWBERT SERIES

The Howbert series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium.  Howbert soils are on mountain slopes and in swales.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.
