HOTTIS SERIES

The Hottis series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in clayey till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 12 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, semiactive, frigid Haplic Glossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Hottis sandy loam, on a north-facing, convex, 18 percent slope in a wooded pasture at an elevation of 241 meters (790 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated. When described on August 30, 1994, the soil was dry to 12 inches and moist below.)

 A--0 to 13 cm (5 inches); very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy loam, gray (10YR 6/1) dry; moderate medium granular structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; 5 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. [10 to 18 cm (4 to 7 inches) thick]

 E/B--13 to 23 cm (5 to 9 inches); brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam (E), very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; occupies about 80 percent of the horizon surrounding peds of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam (Bt); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine and medium roots; 5 percent gravel; very strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. [0 to 15 cm (6 inches) thick]

 B/E--23 to 33 cm (9 to 13 inches); brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay (Bt); occupies about 70 percent of the horizon surrounded by brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam (E), very pale brown (10YR 7/3) dry; strong medium angular blocky structure; firm; few fine and medium roots; 5 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. [10 to 18 cm (4 to 7 inches) thick]

 Bt--33 to 84 cm (13 to 33 inches); strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) clay; strong fine and medium angular blocky structure; firm; many distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary. [23 to 64 cm (9 to 25 inches) thick]

 BC--84 to 203 cm (33 to 80 inches); brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay; moderate coarse subangular blocky structure; firm; few distinct dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) clay films on faces of peds; common prominent pinkish white (7.5YR 8/2) carbonate coatings on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; 5 percent gravel; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Iosco County, Michigan; about 3 miles west of the town of Whittemore; 2,075 feet south and 3,300 feet west of the northeast corner of sec. 7, T. 21 N., R. 5 E., Burleigh Township; USGS Prescott topographic quadrangle; lat. 44 degrees 13 minutes 41 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 52 minutes 34 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 
Depth to carbonates: 51 to 89 cm (20 to 35 inches)
Rock fragment content: 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 2 percent cobbles throughout
Particle-size control section: 45 to 60 percent clay as a weighted average; content of sand coarser than very fine sand is 15 to 45 percent; base saturation is 70 to 100 percent in all subhorizons 
Mean annual soil temperature: 7.2 to 8.3 degrees C (45 to 47 degrees F)

A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 3 or 4
Chroma: 1 or 2, moist or dry
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

E part of the E/B and B/E horizons:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Value: 5 to 7
Chroma: 2 or 3, moist or dry

Bt part of the E/B horizon:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR
Texture: sandy loam or loam

Bt part of the B/E and the Bt horizon:
Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR
Value: 3 to 5
Chroma: 3 to 6
Reaction: moderately acid to neutral

BC horizon:
Hue: 5YR to 10YR
Value: 4 to 6
Chroma: 3 or 4
Clay content: 45 to 60 percent
Reaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline

Some pedons have a C horizon within the series control section.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Curtisville and Mongo series. Curtisville soils have less than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Mongo soils average less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hottis soils are on side slopes and ridges of moraines and dissected till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 12 to 45 percent. These soils formed in clayey till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees). Frost-free period is 90 to 130 days. Elevation is 183 to 427 meters (600 to 1,400 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The moderately well drained Kent, the somewhat poorly drained Selkirk, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Sims soils are closely associated with the Hottis soils in a drainage sequence. Kent soils are on less-sloping positions. Selkirk soils are in depressions. Sims soils do not have an argillic horizon and are in depressions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION: The Hottis soils are dominantly in permanent pasture or forest land. Native vegetation is forest, consisting chiefly of sugar maple, American beech, American elm, and some eastern hemlock and eastern white pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRA 94A in the northern part of Lower Michigan. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Iosco County, Michigan, 1994. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 13 cm (5 inches) (A horizon).
Glossic horizon: from a depth of 13 to 33 cm (5 to 13 inches) (E/B and B/E horizons). 
Argillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 84 cm (9 to 33 inches) (Bt part of the B/E and the Bt horizon).

This series was formerly included with the Kent series as a well drained phase.
