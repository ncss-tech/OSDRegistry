HUBBARD SERIES

The Hubbard series consists of very deep, excessively and well drained soils that formed in sandy glacial outwash or sandy alluvial sediments of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  These soils are on slightly concave to convex slopes on outwash plains, valley trains and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 730 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Hapludolls
