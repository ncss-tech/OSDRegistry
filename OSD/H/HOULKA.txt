HOULKA SERIES

The Houlka series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, soils that formed in clayey alluvium. Houlka soils are on flood plains of the Southern Coastal Plain  and the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1430 millimeters (56 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F).  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Aeric Epiaquerts 

TYPICAL PEDON: Houlka silty clay, in a cultivated field at an elevation of 76 meters (250 feet). (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted).

 Bss--20 to 61 centimeters (8 to 24 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay; moderate coarse angular blocky structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; firm; very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; common large intersecting slickensides having polished and grooved surfaces; common fine faint brown (10YR 5/3) masses of oxidized iron; common fine brown (10YR 4/3) concretions of iron and manganese; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary. 

 Bssg1--61 to 97 centimeters (24 to 38 inches); light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) clay; moderate coarse angular blocky structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; firm; very sticky, very plastic; few fine roots; common large intersecting slickensides having polished and grooved surfaces; many fine and medium distinct brown (10YR 4/3) and common fine and medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; common fine brown (10YR 4/3) concretions of iron and manganese; ; the areas of light brownish gray are iron depletions and parent material; strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary. 

 Bssg2--97 to 165 centimeters (38 to 65 inches); gray (5Y 6/1) clay; massive; firm; very sticky, very plastic; common large intersecting slickensides having polished and grooved surfaces; many medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8), brown (7.5YR 4/4), and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) masses of oxidized iron; common fine brown (10YR 4/3) concretions of iron and manganese; ; the areas of gray are iron depletions and parent material; strongly acid. (Combined thickness of the Bss and Bssg horizons range from 102 to more than 152 centimeters (40 to more than 60 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Parent Material: 0 to 200 centimeters (0 to 79 inches) clayey alluvium.
Landscape: Coastal plains  (Blackland Prairie) 
Landform: flood plains.
3D surface morphometry: talf

Mean annual air temperature: 11 to 24.5 degrees C (52 to 76 degrees F)
Mean annual precipitation: 1170 to 1640 millimeters (46 to 64.5 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
The Arkabutla, Belden, and Mathiston soils are fine-silty and are in slightly higher positions on natural levees. 
The Leeper and Sucarnoochee soils are in positions similar to those of the Houlka soils and are less acid throughout.
Marietta soils are moderately well drained and are in slightly higher positions on natural levees.
Tuscumbia soils are poorly drained and are on slightly lower positions.
Una soils are poorly drained and are in depressions and have mixed mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class: Somewhat poorly drained
Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat): very slow
Water features: No free water has been observed in these soils except on slickenside faces or in large root channels. The dark surface, subsurface and low chroma matrix colors are derived from the colors of the parent material and hydrology.
Flooding frequency: occasional or frequent
Flooding duration: brief or very brief
Ponding frequency and Duration: None

USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas have been cleared.  Cultivated crops such as cotton, corn, soybeans, and small grains are the dominant use. A moderate acreage is in pasture and hay. Wooded areas are in mixed hardwoods or loblolly pine plantations. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:
Major Land Resource Area: Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) and  Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie (MLRA 135A). Extent: Moderate extent.
