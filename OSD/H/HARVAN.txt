HARVAN SERIES

The Harvan series consists of shallow to a densic contact, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Harvan soils are on backslopes of pediment remnants. Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 200 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplargids 

TYPICAL PEDON: Harvan gravelly sandy loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 60 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles. Lithology of the rock fragments is mainly welded tuff. 

    A--0 to 10 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3)moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots throughout; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel; noneffervescent; neutral (pH 7.3); clear smooth boundary. (4 to 15 cm thick) 

    Btk1--10 to 36 cm; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and few medium roots throughout; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 15 percent distinct clay films around rock fragments; 10 percent fine irregular very strongly cemented calcium carbonate nodules with sharp boundaries in matrix and 5 percent fine irregular very strongly cemented calcium carbonate laminae with clear boundaries on bottom of rock fragments; 60 percent gravel and 10 percent calcium carbonate nodules; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); clear smooth boundary. 

    Btk2--36 to 50 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots throughout; common very fine and fine interstitial pores; 10 percent distinct clay films around rock fragments; 20 percent fine very strongly cemented calcium carbonate laminae with clear boundaries on the bottom of rock fragments; 60 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary. (26 to 46 cm thick combined) 

    2Cd--50 to 150 cm; light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, yellowish red (5YR 4/6) moist; massive; nonsticky and nonplastic; moderately cemented; high excavation difficulty; 30 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; very slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abalan, Alcan, Armoine, Berit, Bouncer, Entero, Flex, Ginex, Penelas, Ravenell, Sedsked, Soar, Stodick and Zyzzi soils. 

Abalan, Alcan, Armoine, Berit, Bouncer, Entero, Flex, Ginex, Penelas, Ravenell, Sedsked, Soar, Stodick, and Zyzzi soils do not have densic materials in the lower horizons. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harvan soils are on backslopes of rock pediment remnants. Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits. Elevations are 1,400 to 1,900 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm; mean annual air temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Linco, Devildog and Acana soils. Linco soils are very deep and do not have argillic horizons. Devildog soils are very deep and have cambic horizons. Acana soils are shallow to a duripan and have durinodes. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability to the densic contact, then slow permeability in the densic layer; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity to the densic contact then moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity in the densic layer. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for wildlife habitat and livestock grazing. Potential native vegetation is black sagebrush, Nevada ephedra, rabbitbrush, Indian ricegrass, Whipple's yucca and blue grama. This pedon is correlated to ecological site number R029XY167NV, Gravelly Loam 8-10 P.Z.
