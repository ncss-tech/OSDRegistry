HUERFANO SERIES

The Huerfano series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that are sodium affected. Huerfano soils formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. These soils are on summits of mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, valley floors and plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Typic Natrargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Huerfano sandy clay loam--rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

(0 to 2 inches thick)

    E--1 to 2 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) sandy clay loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine discontinuous vesicular pores; violently effervescent; very strongly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 2 inches thick)

(1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bk--7 to 15 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; few fine continuous pores; violently effervescent; few fine calcium carbonate accumulations; strongly alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick)

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competitors.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Huerfano soils are on summits of mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, valley floors and plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevation is from 5,400 to 6,800 feet. These soils formed in alluvium weathered from shale, sandstone or siltstone. The frost-free period is 130 to 165 days. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 10 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kimbeto and Razito soils. Kimbeto and Razito soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; slow to very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used livestock grazing. Present vegetation is black greasewood, mound saltbush, fourwing saltbush, shadscale, alkali sacaton, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern New Mexico. MLRA 35, LRR-D. This series is of small extent.
