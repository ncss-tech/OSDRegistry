HONEYCREEK SERIES

The Honeycreek series consists of deep to schist bedrock, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from schist and or gneiss of pre-Cambrian age. These gently sloping soils are on undulating plains on dissected plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).
