HOFLY SERIES

The Hofly series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Hofly soils are mountain slopes, mesas, and hills.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hofly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 3 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to moderate very fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 32 inches; dark gray (10YR 4/1) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (2.5Y 3/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (13 to 35 inches thick)

    C--32 to 60 inches; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) clay, dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, very firm, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; 5 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  San Miguel County, Colorado; about 10 miles north of Placerville, Colorado; located about 800 feet north and 250 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 16, T. 45 N., R. 10 W.; Horsefly Peak USGS quad; lat. 38 degrees 08 minutes 50 seconds N. and long. 107 degrees 38 minutes 58 seconds W., NAD 27

Value: 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4, dry or moist

COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family.  Hoosan soils in a closely related family have mixed mineralogy.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from shale, with some influence from residuum.
Landform:  mountain slopes, hills, and mesas.
Slopes:  5 to 40 percent.
Elevation:  8,500 to 10,000 feet.
Mean annual air temperature:  35 to 40 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation:  20 to 26 inches.
Wettest months:  July and August.
Driest Months:  May and June receive slightly less precipitation than other months however, the soils are still moist from snowmelt.
Frost-free period:  40 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Adel, Baird Hollow, Nordicol, and Ryman soils.  Adel soils are fine-loamy.  Baird Hollow and Nordicol soils are skeletal and have an argillic horizon.  Ryman soils have mixed mineralogy.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for summer livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Principal native vegetation is Gambel's oak, mountain snowberry, mountain brome, elk sedge, Arizona fescue, western wheatgrass, and mountain muhly.  Brushy Loam range site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Colorado.  MLRA 48A.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  San Miguel County (San Miguel Area), Colorado, 1987.

REMARKS:

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon (pachic feature): from 0 to 32 inches (A and Bw horizons).
Particle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bw and part of the C horizons).

The 02/1997 revision changed clay mineralogy from mixed to smectitic.
