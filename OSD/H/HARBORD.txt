HARBORD SERIES

The Harbord series consists of very deep, well drained, medium permeable soils that formed in tertiary sediments capped by a thin layer of loess.  These soils are on gently sloping to rolling uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degree F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON: Harbord loam, cultivated.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

  Ap--0 to 5 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate fine granules; slightly hard, very friable; noncalcareous; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

  Bt--5 to 15 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) light clay loam; brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocks; hard, very friable; many thin patchy clay films on horizontal and vertical faces of peds; noncalcareous; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 14 inches thick)

  2Btkb--15 to 35 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/3) light clay loam;  brown (7.5YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium subangular blocks; very hard, friable; thin patchy clay films on peds; visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks coating peds; noncalcareous ped interiors, calcareous crushed soil mass; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (14 to 24 inches thick)

  2Bkb--35 to 40 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) light clay loam;  brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, friable; few thin patchy clay films on peds; visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)

  2Ckb--40 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/3) loam; brown (7.5YR 5/3) moist; massive; hard, very friable; moderate visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions, in thin seams and streaks, and in finely divided forms; strongly alkaline.  (Several feet thick)
