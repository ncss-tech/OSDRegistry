HOWCAN SERIES  

The Howcan series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks on mountainsides,  footslopes, and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F.  

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Howcan gravelly loam on a 20 percent convex,  southeast-facing slope in rangeland at 6,900 feet elevation.  (Colors  are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on September  30, 1980, the soil was dry throughout.)  

    A--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate thin platy structure;  slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;  common very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular  pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (3  to 6 inches thick)  

    Bt1--4 to 10 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, dark brown  (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky  structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;  many very fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel,  10 percent cobbles; common faint films on faces of peds and lining  pores; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 8 inches  thick)  

    Bt2--10 to 30 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly loam,  dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate coarse subangular blocky  structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic;  many very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores; 25 percent  gravel, 30 percent cobbles; few faint clay films on faces of peds and  lining pores; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual smooth boundary.  (16 to 26  inches thick)  

    BC--30 to 48 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) very gravelly loam,  dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky  structure;  slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly  plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine tubular pores;  30 percent gravel, 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.3); gradual smooth  boundary.  (10 to 25 inches thick)  

    C--48 to 60 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; massive, slightly hard, friable, slightly  sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine irregular pores; 30  percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clanalpine, Heechee, Holmes, Horrocks,  Hoskin, Pequop, Moreypeak, Suak, Valmar, Vitale and Wambolt (T) series.  Clanalpine,  Hoskin, Suak, Valmar, and Vitale soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Heechee soils have stones in the Bt horizon and have 25 to 35 percent  clay in the particle size control section. Holmes soils have sola less  than 32 inches thick.  Horrocks soils have sola less than 40 inches  thick.  Pequop soils have the base of argillic horizons deeper than 40  inches and have average annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F.  Howeypeak soils are moderately deep to a paralithic content.  Wambolt soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and receive intermittent summer precipitation for 10 to 20 days cumulative.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Howcan soils are on mountainsides, foothills, and  fan terraces and have slopes of 12 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 8,000 feet.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from extrusive  igneous rocks.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and dry in  summer. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and average  annual temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 45  to 90 days.  

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hagenbarth, Hutchley,  Justesen, and Soen soils.  Hagenbarth soils are on mountains, have  cryic soil temperature regimes and fine-loamy particle-size control  sections.  Hutchley soils are on mountains and ridges and are shallow to  bedrock.  Justesen soils are on fan terraces and have fine-loamy  particle-size control sections.  Soen soils are on toeslopes and have  fine textured particle-size control section.  

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow and medium runoff;  moderate permeability.  

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland.  Vegetation is mainly mountain big  sagebrush and bluebunch wheatgrass.  

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East-central Idaho.  These soils are not  extensive.
