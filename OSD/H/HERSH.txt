HERSH SERIES

The Hersh series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in mixed eolian sandy and loamy material.  These soils are on uplands and stream terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 56 centimeters do not have redoximorphic features 56 centimeters (22 inches), and mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.) at the type location.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, mesic Typic Ustorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hersh fine sandy loam - on a 4 percent convex slope in a cultivated field.  When described the soil was moist throughout. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

   Ap--0 to 10 centimeters (0 to 4 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.

   A--10 to 18 centimeters (4 to 7 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizons is 10 to 30 centimeters (4 to 12 inches) thick.)

   AC--18 to 28 centimeters (7 to 11 inches); grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; neutral; clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) thick)

   C--28 to 203 centimeters (11 to 80 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable; neutral.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nebraska; about 7 miles south and 1/2 mile east of North Platte; 101 meters (330 feet) south and 732 meters (2400 feet) west of the northeast corner of sec. 16, T. 12 N., R. 30 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: moist in some part from October through April; intermittently moist from May through June; driest in July through September
Moisture regime: ustic
Depth to secondary carbonates: below 102 centimeters (40 inches)

A/Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 to 6, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: fine sandy loam loamy fine sand
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

AC horizon: (where present)
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand 
Reaction: slightly acid or neutral

C horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand
Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline
Comment: Many pedons grade to loamy fine sand and coarser material below a depth of 76 centimeters (30 inches).  Some pedons are stratified with silty material below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches).

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Seelez series.
Seelez soils have a genetic accumulation of carbonates (Bk horizon) within a depth of 76 centimeters (30 inches).  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Parent material: mixed sandy and loamy eolian material
Landscape: uplands
Slope: 0 to 60 percent  
Mean annual temperature: 10 to 14 degrees C. (49 to 57 degrees F.)  
Mean annual precipitation: 51 to 61 centimeters (20 to 24 inches)

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Anselmo, Doger, Dunday, Kenesaw, and Valentine soils.  
Anselmo soils are on similar landscapes.  
Dunday and Doger soils have sandy control sections and a mollic epipedon.  
Doger soils have mollic colors greater than 20 inches thick and generally are below Hersh soils.   
Kenesaw soils have a coarse-silty control section, a mollic epipedon and occur below Hersh soils.  
Valentine soils have a sandy control section and are above Hersh soils, commonly on rolling or undulating landscapes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  
Drainage: well drained
Runoff: low on the nearly level slopes to high on the steep slopes  
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  high

USE AND VEGETATION: More of the acreage is cultivated and the rest is in native range.  
The principal crops are winter wheat, grain sorghum, corn, and alfalfa.  
Native vegetation is mainly little bluestem, prairie sandreed, bluegrama, and needleandthread.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hersh soils are of large extent and are in south-central Nebraska and possibly north-central Kansas.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Logan County, Nebraska, 1969.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (Ap and A horzons)

Many areas of Hersh soils were formerly mapped as eroded phases of Anselmo soils.  

Modified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
