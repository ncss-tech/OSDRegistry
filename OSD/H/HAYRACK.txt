HAYRACK SERIES

The Hayrack series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from interbedded sandstone and shale, with basalt overburden.  Hayrack soils are on mountain sideslopes, and broad ridge slopes and toeslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Alfic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hayrack clay loam - forest, old burn area of spruce-fir.   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oe--0 to 2 cm; partially decomposed needles, leaves and surface duff.

    A--2 to 23 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (20 to 38 cm thick)

    E--23 to 36 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, slightly plastic; 5 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--36 to 56 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) gravelly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; strong fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; many, distinct clay films on ped faces; 10 percent gravel, 5 percent cobble; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.   (15 to 30 cm thick)

    C--56 to 152 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/2) cobbly clay, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist; massive; very hard, firm, sticky, plastic; few faint clay films; 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble; neutral (pH 7.0).

TYPE LOCATION:  Delta County, Colorado; in the NW1/4 of the SW1/4 of Sec. 12, T. 10 S., R. 91 W.  Latitude:  39 degrees, 11 minutes, 51 seconds North; Longitude:  107 degrees, 30 minutes, 14 seconds West.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 2.2 to 5.6 C.  Hayrack soils are generally noncalcareous throughout, but may be weakly calcareous in the lower C horizon below 100 cm. Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent, and are less than 25 cm in diameter.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent in the particle size control section.  Precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year, except from May 15 to July 15, when about one-half of the normal monthly precipitation is received.  Depth to the base of the Bt horizon ranges from 46 to 76 cm.

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.

The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.   Fine earth textures are fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam

The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.   Fine earth textures are clay loam, silty clay, or clay.

The C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is slightly alkaline through slightly acid.  Fine earth textures are clay loam or clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cebone (CO), Donald (MT), Gaylord (MT), Mord (CO), and Powderhorn (CO) series.  Cebone soils have a paralithic contact above 100 cm.  Donald and Gaylord soils have consistent "k" horizons. Powderhorn soils have hues of 5YR and redder in the Bt and C horizons. Mord soils are greater than 127 cm to the base of the Bt horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hayrack soils are on mountain sideslopes and broad ridge slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium mainly from sandstone and shale.  Basaltic materials occur on and in the surface layers in some areas.  The elevation ranges from 2,590 to 3,140 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 635 to 890 mm.   Mean annual temperature ranges from 1.1 to 5.6 C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cochetopa, Muggins, Nutras, and Tellura series.  Cochetopa soils have pachic epipedons.  Muggins soils have the base of the Bt to depths greater than 100 cm.  Nutras and Tellura soils have clayey-skeletal particle size control sections.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to slow runoff; moderately slow to slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Use is mainly for forest production and wildlife habitat.  The potential native vegetation is Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, and subalpine fir with some grasses, shrubs, and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mountain areas of west central Colorado and possibly parts of eastern Utah.  The series is of small extent.
