HEIDEN SERIES

The Heiden series consists of deep and very deep to mudstone, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum weathered from mudstone. These nearly level to moderately steep soils occur on footslopes of base slopes, shoulders of interfluves, and backslopes of side slopes of ridges on dissected plains. Slopes range from 0.5 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Altoga, Austin, Bastsil, Branyon, Ferris, Frio, Houston Black, Lewisville, Lott, Payne, Tinn, and Venus series.

Houston Black soils: occur on similar positions
Lott soils: do not have slickensides and occur on slightly higher similar positions
Tinn soils: do not have densic materials within 165 cm (65 in) and occur on flood plains

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  
Drainage class: Well. 
Permeability class: Very slow. 
Runoff: high on 0.5 to less than 1 percent slopes and very high on 1 to 20 percent slopes. 
Infiltration is rapid when the soil is dry and cracked, but very slow when the soil is wet.

USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and hay production. Some areas are used for crop production. Improved bermudagrass, grain sorghum, corn, cotton, and wheat are the principal crops. The native plant community is fire-influenced tallgrass plant community, dominated by big bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and little bluestem. Midgrasses such as sideoats grama, Virginia wildrye, Florida paspalum, Texas wintergrass, hairy grama, and dropseeds are also abundant. A wide variety of forbs add to the diverse native plant community. Mottes of live oak and hackberry trees are also native. Improper grazing will result in a reduction of tall grass dominance and an increase in composition of mid-grasses, unpalatable forbs, and woody species. Most areas have been cultivated, and are now in grass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East Central Texas; Land Resource Region J; MLRA 86A. The series is extensive.
