HANO SERIES

The Hano series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on hillslopes.  These soils formed in thin eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived dominantly from shale and sandstone.  Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 1l inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the  Alesna (NM), Keeseha (AZ), Poley (AZ), and Silva (NM) series.  Alesna soils have 5 to 34 percent rock fragments. Keeseha soils are less than 20 inches to the base of the Bt horizon and have redder hues.  Poley soils have calcic horizons at depths of greater than 20 inches.. Silva soils have calcic horizons at depths of 30 to 40 inches.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hano soils are on hillslopes.  These soils formed in slope alluvium from shale mantled with eolian deposits.  Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Elevations are 5700 to 6100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, the average annual air temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F, and the average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cannonville, Jocity, Tewa, and Wepo, soils.  Cannonville soils are on hillslopes and are shallow to soft, weathered shale.  Jocity soils lack diagnostic horizons and are on alluvial fans and flood plains.  Tewa soils are on stream terraces, have fine-loamy control sections and lack argillic horizons. Wepo soils lack argillic horizons and have depths of 60 inches or more.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium.  Permeability is slow.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hano soils are used for grazing and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is galleta, alkali sacaton, Indian ricegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, shadscale and fourwing saltbush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona.  The soils of this series are not extensive; their total extent to date is about 8500 acres. MLRA 35.
