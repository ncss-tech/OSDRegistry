HELLROARING SERIES

The Hellroaring series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits. These sodium affected soils occur on lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic Oxyaquic Haplocryalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Hellroaring loam, in rangeland on a 1 percent slope at an elevation of 2021 meters (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

(0 to 15 cm thick)

(combined thickness of Btn horizons - 30 to 65 cm)

   Btkn--45 to 67 cm; light gray (10YR 7/2) clay loam, light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine tubular pores; 5 percent faint patchy clay films on all faces of peds; finely disseminated calcium carbonate and 2 percent fine, faint, irregular soft masses of calcium carbonate; strongly effervescent; very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 25 cm thick)

   C--67 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) clay loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/3) moist; 25 percent medium prominent brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) redox concentrations; massive; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few fine tubular pores; finely disseminated calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0).

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Bozeman, Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Horse Prairie-South Valley Area - Part of Beaverhead County, Montana, 2011; proposed in Beaverhead County, Montana, 2010.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 15 cm (A1, A2 horizons)
Natric horizon - from 15 to 67 cm (Btn1, Btn2, Btkn horizons)
Particle-size control section - from 15 to 65 cm (Btn1, Btn2, part of Btkn horizons)

Note: The Btn1 horizon has mollic colors, but does not meet the rupture resistance requirement for a mollic epipedon

Hellroaring soils have a cryic temperature regime, an ustic moisture regime and an oxyaquic subclass.
