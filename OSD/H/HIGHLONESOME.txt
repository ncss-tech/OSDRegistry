HIGHLONESOME SERIES

The Highlonesome series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on alluvial flats, playa steps, playa slopes and playas. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Highlonesome soils are on alluvial flats, playa steps, playa slopes and playas. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,982 to 4,039 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hondale(NM), Turney(NM), Vado(NM), Yturbide(NM), and Ubar(NM) soils. Hondale soils are on sodic playas and are fine textured. Turney soils are on alluvial flats and are non-sodic. Vado soils are on shore-complexes and have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments. Yturbide soils are on playa dunes and sandsheets and are sandy. Ubar soils are on alluvial flats and playas and are fine textured and non-sodic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; negligible runoff; rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: The major use is rangeland. Native vegetation is alkali Sacaton, sueda nigra, tubercled saltbush, sixweeks grama, and tobosagrass. Barren areas are caused by sodium and other salts and extensive ponding. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Animas Valley Playas, New Mexico. MLRA 41, Highlonesome is of limited extent.

SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES PROPOSED: Animas Valley Playas Project, Hidalgo County, New Mexico, 2017. The name Highlonesome is derived from a local stock tank.
