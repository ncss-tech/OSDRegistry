COMPETING SERIES: This is the Affey series. Affey soils are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Homestake soils are on eroded fan remnants at elevations of 1,950 to 2,200 meters. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Homestake soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and mixed lacustrine sediments. The climate is cool and continental. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 350 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basket, Holtle, Pagecreek, and Satt soils. Basket lack mollic epipedons. Holtle soils have a cambic horizon between 33 and 71 cm.  Pagecreek soils have a mollic epipedon that is 100 to 150 cm thick. Satt soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well-drained; medium runoff; slow permeability; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat and livestock grazing. The principal vegetation is mountain big sagebrush and antelope bitterbrush with an understory of bluebunch wheatgrass and needlegrasses. Singleleaf pinyon and Utah Juniper have invaded many areas of this range site associated with Homestake soils. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: East-central Nevada.  Homestake soils are of a small extent. MLRA 28B.
