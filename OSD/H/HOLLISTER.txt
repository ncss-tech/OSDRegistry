HOLLISTER SERIES

The Hollister series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in calcareous alluvial clays of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level and very gently sloping soils are on broad plain terraces of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA-78C, MLRA-78B).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in).

REMARKS:  

Classification of the Hollister series was changed from Pachic Argiustolls to Typic Haplusterts in 03/1998 based on a study across the series province in Texas and Oklahoma during 1998.  

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: 0 to 81 cm (0 to 32 in) (Ap, Bw and Bkss1 horizons)
Cambic horizon: 15 to 31 cm (6 to 12 in) (Bw horizon)
Vertic features: slickensides from 31 to 203 cm (12 to 75 in) (Bss, Bkss, and 2BCss horizons)
Lithologic discontinuity: at the boundary of the 2BCss horizon, 178 cm (70 in)
