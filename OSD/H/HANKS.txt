HANKS SERIES

The Hanks series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic and related rocks. Hanks soils are on sideslopes, saddles, benches, and ridge crests and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Typic Dystrocryepts

TYPICAL PEDON: Hanks gravelly coarse sandy loam--on a 30 percent slope at an elevation of 7,800 feet in forested lands. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

    Oi--0 to 0.3 inch; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) slightly decomposed needles, twigs, and cones; slightly matted; very strongly acid (pH 4.9); abrupt wavy boundary. (0 to 4 inches thick)

    Bw--3 to 11 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate very fine crumb structure; slightly hard and very friable; common very fine, fine, and medium and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 20 percent angular gravel, mostly less than 5 mm. across; strongly acid (pH 5.2); gradual irregular boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    BC--11 to 27 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) gravelly coarse sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; 40 percent of very pale brown (10YR 7/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate very fine crumb structure; soft and very friable; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; 22 percent angular gravel, mostly less than 5 mm. across; strongly acid (pH 5.5); gradual irregular boundary. (7 to 30 inches thick)

    C1--27 to 40 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) and very pale brown (10YR 8/4) gravelly loamy coarse sand, light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; structureless, massive; soft and very friable; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine tubular pores; 30 percent angular gravel; strongly acid (pH 5.5); clear wavy boundary.

(0 to 30 inches thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Boise County, Idaho; southwest 1/4, southwest 1/4 of section 21, T. 10 N., R. 6 E.; coordinates from the fiducial center of serial photograph ELD 29-71, 2.8 inches north and 1.8 inches east.

COMPETING SERIES: These are Lake Janee, Mccloud, and Smithfha. All of these soils are loamy throughout the particle-size control section. In addition Lake Janee soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick. Mccloud soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 30 inches. Smithfha soils have an albic horizon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The soils are in mountains at elevations between 6,000 and 8,000 feet. The areas consist mostly of upper sideslopes, saddles, benches, and ridge crests. Slopes range from about 5 to 65 percent. Most aspects are northerly. The soils are forming in residuum and possibly colluvium derived from granitic and related rocks. The average annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches and includes 140 to 180 inches of snowfall. The average frost-free period is 20 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Josie and Whitecap series. The Josie soils have umbric epipedons 10 to 16 inches thick. The Whitecap soils have bedrock at 10 to 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained; medium or rapid runoff; and moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for watershed, grazing, wildlife, recreation, and forestry. The vegetation is mostly pure and mixed stands of subalpine fir and lodgepole pine and some Douglas-fir. The understory includes dwarf and tall huckleberry, mountain ash, currant, twinberry, elk sedge, woodrush, sickletop pedicularis, alumroot, Indian paintbrush, arnica, and lupine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Probably in much of the higher part of the Idaho Batholith. Moderately extensive.
