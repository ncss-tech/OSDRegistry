HONDEE SERIES

The Hondee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. They are on upper lake terraces and alluvial fans.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches. The average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hondee gravelly loam - on a 3 percent southeasterly slope at 4,820 feet elevation. (Color is for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Ap--0 to 6 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine and very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear wavy boundary.   (4 to 8 inches thick)

    AB--6 to 16 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine and very fine roots; few fine and common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual wavy boundary.  (6 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk1--16 to 19 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; 40 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; 1 to 2 mm thick lime coatings on underside of gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); abrupt wavy boundary. (3 to 13 inches thick)

    Bk2--19 to 22 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly sandy loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine  tubular pores; 45 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; 1 to 3 mm thick lime coatings on underside of coarse fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (3 to 18 inches thick)

    Bk3--22 to 39 inches; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; soft, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 65 percent gravel and 5 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; 1 mm thick lime pendents on the underside of coarse fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual wavy boundary. (0 to 17 inches thick)

    2Bk4--39 to 60 inches; variegated very gravelly loamy coarse sand; common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) relic mottles; single grain; loose; common very fine tubular pores; 30 percent grave and l5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; 1 mm thick lime coatings on the underside of coarse fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).


TYPE LOCATION: Franklin County, Idaho; about 1/2 mile south of Weston; about 1,650 feet west and 1,240 feet south of the northeast corner of sec. 23, T.16S., R38E.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alpowa, Bonnet, Copperton, Hupp, Lakewin, Middle and Stricker (T) soils. The Alpowa and Bonnet soils have average annual soil temperatures greater than 50 degrees F. Copperton soils have weakly to moderately cemented layers at 12 to 30 inches and the average summer soil temperature is greater than 65 degrees F. Hupp soils have more than 50 percent coarse fragments in the control section and have a cambic horizon. Lakewin soils have average annual soil temperatures higher than 50 degrees F.  Middle soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Stricker soils have a cambic horizon with more than 18 percent clay.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hondee soils are on upper lake terraces and alluvial fans at elevations of 4,700 to 5,800 feet. They formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost free period is 110 to 125 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Collinston, Mendon, Parleys and Sterling soils. Collinston soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section and are calcareous throughout. Mendon and Parleys soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section and have argillic horizons. Sterling soils are calcareous throughout. These soils are on adjacent lake terrace positions.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Slow to very rapid runoff.  Moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hondee soils are used mainly for irrigated cropland and rangeland. The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Nevada bluegrass, and basin big sagebrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Idaho.  These soils are not extensive.
