HUMBUG SERIES

The Humbug series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and eolian deposits overlying residuum derived from interbedded sandstone, shale and gypsum bedrock.  Humbug soils are on rolling shale hills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  The Andergeorge, Dutchman and Tulargo are similar, but are very deep.  In addition, Andergeorge soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size class.  Dutchman soils have a typic aridic soil moisture regime.  Tulargo soils do not have a calcic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  slope alluvium and eolian deposits over residuum derived from interbedded sandstone, shale and gypsum bedrock.
Landform:  shale hills, gypsum hills, and structural benches
Slopes:  2 to 15 percent
Elevation:  4,800 to 7,200 feet
Mean annual temperature:  45 to 52 degrees F
Mean annual precipitation:  9 to 12 inches
Precipitation pattern:  Wettest months are July to October and driest months are Deember and June.  
Frost-free period:  110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grassytrail, Lemrac, Mussentuchit and Simel series.  The Grassytrail soils are very deep and are in concave areas and on stream terraces.  The Lemrac and Mussentuchit soils do not have calcic horizons, are moderately deep and are on steeper areas of shale hills.  The Simel soils are shallow to shale bedrock and are on breaks and near shale outcrops.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, very low to medium runoff, moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Humbug soils are used for wildlife and livestock grazing. Native vegetation is mainly Mormon tea, winterfat, fourwing saltbush, galleta, sand dropseed, Indian ricegrass and rabbitbrush.  Small areas in higher elevations on the San Rafael Swell have scattered Utah juniper and pinyon pine.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Utah; LRR D, MLRA 34B and 35; moderate extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Grand Staircase-Escalante soil survey area, Utah.  The series was proposed in Emery County, Utah, Emery area soil survey, Utah.  Named for Humbug Wash and Humbug Flat in the area of the type location. 

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk, Bky, By1, By2 and Cy horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)
Calcic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 25 inches.  (Bk and Bky horizons)
Gypsic horizon:  The zone from 14 to 44 inches.  (Bky, By1, By2 and Cy horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with shale at 44 inches.  (Cr horizon)

Remarks:  National Soil Survey Laboratory sample S95UT-015-003.

The wide range of soil color in the lower profile reflects the light gray to red colors of the shale layers of the parent material.  A lithologic discontinuity is not recognized in this series due to the inherent interbedded nature of the parent material.  The Cy horizon typically effervesces slowly for a long period of time as does the shale bedrock.

The lab data indicates that Humbug is well into fine-gypseous particle size class, however, other field data may indicate coarse-gypseous.
