HOSKINNINI SERIES

The Hoskinnini series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Hoskinnini soils are on dissected pediments and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Lithic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hoskinnini gravelly fine sandy loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 1 inches; light red (2.5YR 6/6) gravelly fine sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; vesicular; thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable; surface pavement of fine iron stained caliche fragments; moderately calcareous; carbonates are disseminated with many caliche fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (1/2 to 2 inches thick)

    Bt1--1 to 4 inches; red (2.5YR 4/6) gravelly fine sandy loam, dark red (2.5YR 3/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to medium fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 25 percent gravel size caliche fragments; moderately calcareous; carbonates are disseminated and in caliche fragments; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear smooth boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bt2--4 to 8 inches; red (2.5YR 5/6) gravelly fine sandy loam, red (2.5YR 4/6) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; 25 percent gravel size caliche fragments; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 5 inches thick)

    Bk--8 to 12 inches; pink (5YR 7/4) fine sandy loam, light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; few fine pores; strongly calcareous; carbonates are in nodules; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); abrupt wavy boundary.  (3 to 5 inches thick)

    R--12 inches; sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION:  San Juan County, Utah; 5 miles west and 10 miles north of Oljeto Trading Post; northeast 1/4 sec. 31, T. 41 S., R. 14 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  

Depth to bedrock: 8 to 20 inches deep

Mean annual soil temperature: 54 to 59 degrees F.

Mean summer soil temperature: 74 to 79 degrees F.

Soil moisture: The soils are dry in all parts above the base of the moisture control section for 75 to 85 percent of the time. Typic aridic moisture regime.

Rock fragments: About 15 to 30 percent gravel size caliche fragments occur throughout the profile.

A horizon
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6 dry, 3 moist
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Bt horizon
Hue: 2.5YR or 5YR
Value: 3 to 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist
Chroma: 3 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, loam, clay loam

Bk horizon
Value: 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist
Chroma: 4 to 6, dry or moist
Texture: fine sandy loam, sandy loam
Reaction: moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bojo (NV) and Envol (NV) series.  Bojo soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the argillic horizon and do not have visible carbonates above the bedrock. Envol soils have Bt horizons with hue of 7.5YR and yellower and have an argillic horizon that extends to the lithic contact.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hoskinnini soils are on dissected pediments at elevations of 4,000 to 5,680 feet.  Slope gradients are 1 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from shale and sandstone.  The climate is arid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 74 to 79 degrees F. and the freeze-free period is from 150 to 180 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  This is the Trail soil.  Trail soils lack a lithic contact within depth of 60 inches and have a texture of loamy fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderately rapid permeability to bedrock.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used as rangeland.  The potential vegetation is blackbrush, Mormon tea, Indian ricegrass and snakeweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeastern Utah and northern Arizona.  Hoskinnini soils are moderately extensive. MLRA 35.
