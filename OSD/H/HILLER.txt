HILLER SERIES

The Hiller series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Hiller soils are on ballenas. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Durinodic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Hiller extremely gravelly sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 45 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles and 10 percent stones. 

	A--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many very fine interstitial and few fine interstitial and tubular pores; 55 percent pebbles, 5 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 5 inches thick) 

	Bw--3 to 8 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and few fine roots; few very few and fine interstitial and tubular pores; 40 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary. (4 to 6 inches thick) 

	Bk--8 to 14 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial and tubular pores; common (20 percent) fine distinct calcium carbonate coats on bottom and sides of rock fragments; 40 percent pebbles and 10 percent cobbles;violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); clear wavy boundary. (5 to 10 inches thick) 

	Bqk--14 to 60 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; moderately hard, firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and few fine roots; few very fine interstitial and tubular pores; many (45 percent) fine calcium carbonate and silica coats on bottom of rock fragments; few weakly cemented calcium carbonate seems and soft masses; 35 percent moderately cemented planar durinodes; 40 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.8).

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hiller soils are on ballenas. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,800 to 3,100 feet. The climate is arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches, mean annual temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 240 to 300 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: This is the Huevi soil. Huevi soils have a hyperthermic temperature regime. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush and white bursage. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are moderately extensive.
