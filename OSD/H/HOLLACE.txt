HOLLACE SERIES

The Hollace series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, ignimbrite, basalt, and volcanic tuffs of intermediate composition.  The Hollace soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Ustalfic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hollace very gravelly loam--rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil surface is partially covered with 10 percent cobbles and 35 percent gravel.

    A--0 to 5 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; many fine and medium interstitial pores; 10 percent cobbles and 35 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)

    Bt--5 to 20 cm; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very cobbly clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine roots; common fine and medium tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores; 30 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Btk1--20 to 36 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very cobbly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine and few medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores and common pressure faces; many thin carbonate coats and pendants on vertical and undersides of rock fragments; 30 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (15 to 25 cm thick)

    Btk2--36 to 43 cm; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very cobbly clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine and common medium roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; common faint clay films lining pores and common pressure faces; many moderately thick carbonate coats on vertical and undersides of rock fragments; 30 percent cobbles and 15 percent gravel; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 13 cm thick)

    Bkqm--43 to 53 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/2) indurated petrocalcic horizon, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) moist; massive; extremely hard; violently effervescent.  (8 to 13 cm thick)

    R--53 cm; andesitic bedrock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Lincoln County, Nevada; in the southern Delamar Mountains; approximately 1000 feet east and 2275 feet north of the projected southwest corner of section 7, T. 9 S., R. 64 E.; USGS Delamar 3 NE 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 37 degrees 10 minutes 48 seconds N and longitude 114 degrees 51 minutes 57 seconds W; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 37.1800000 latitude, -114.8658333 longitude.

Depth to bedrock: 46 to 64 cm.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

Particle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 22 to 33 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 55 percent, predominantly cobbles.

A horizon

Chroma:  2 through 4.
Texture: Clay loam or sandy clay loam.
Clay content: 27 to 35 percent.
Carbonates:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.
Other features:  This horizon commonly has fractured petrocalcic material in the lower part.

Bkqm horizon

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Plaintank series. 

The Plaintank soils have gravelly alluvium underlying the petrocalcic horizon.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hollace soils are on mountain slopes.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, ignimbrite, basalt, and volcanic tuffs of intermediate composition.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.   Elevations are 1,280 to 1,710 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 160 to 210 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gabbvally, Kanesprings, and Wyva series.  Gabbvally soils lack a petrocalcic horizon.  Kanesprings soils have mean annual soil temperatures warmer than 15 degrees C and lack a petrocalcic horizon.  Wyva soils lack a petrocalcic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly blackbrush, green ephedra, desert bitterbrush, desert needlegrass, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southern Nevada.  These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 29.
