Characterization data are available for this pedon: KSSL Pedon Number 01N0844.

This edit adopts the semitabular format, updates the series from Tentative to Established, updates the range in characteristics, geographic setting, and includes some minor editorial changes. The typical pedon description is updated to that described when sampled for characterization, and to reflect laboratory results.
