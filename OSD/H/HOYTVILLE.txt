HOYTVILLE SERIES

The Hoytville series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that are deep or very deep to dense till. They formed in clayey till and are on wave-worked till plains, nearshore zones, and water-lain moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 871 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: : Hoytville soils are on wave-worked till plains, nearshore zones, and water-lain moraines of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Hoytville soils formed in clayey till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 720 to 960 mm . Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free period is 135 to 210 days. Elevation is 174 to 244 meters  above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Nappanee, St. Clair, and Toussaint soils. The somewhat poorly drained Nappanee soils and the moderately well drained St. Clair soils are in a catena with Hoytville soils. They are on slight rises, and on back slopes and shoulders of nearby knolls and ridges. In areas where the Toussaint and Hoytville soils are adjacent, the Toussaint soils are on slightly lower positions than the Hoytville soils. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. A perched water table ranges from 30 cm (1 ft) above the surface to 30 cm (1 ft) below the surface from January to April in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high in the upper part of the solum, moderately low in the lower part of the solum, and very low in the substratum. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low.

USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of the Hoytville soils are cultivated. Corn, soybeans and wheat are the principal crops. Some areas are used for specialty crops, such as tomatoes and sugar beets. A relatively small proportion is in woodland. The native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest, primarily swamp white oak, bur oak, pin oak, elm, hickory, ash, cottonwood, basswood, and soft maple with some marsh grasses. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Hoytville series occurs primarily in MLRA 99 in northwestern Ohio, northeastern Indiana, and southeastern Michigan, and to a minor extent in MLRA 96 in west-central Michigan. The series is of large extent, about 850,000 acres.
