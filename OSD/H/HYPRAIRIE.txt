SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (SSRO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Cashmere Mountain Area, Chelan County, Washington; 1995

REMARKS:
Diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon
*Mollic epipedon--zone from the surface to a depth of 64 cm
*Argillic horizon--zone from 64 to 150 cm
*Particle-size control section--zone from 64 to 114 cm

4/2003--Further investigation is needed to determine the relationship of the Hyprairie series with the competing Yaxing series. The 60 to 75 dry days of the Hyprairie soils may be too low; it may be 60 to 90 days or even 75 to 90 days. The Hyprairie soils in the high elevation phase appear to be similar to the Yaxing soils in MLRA 6 that are underlain by sandstone.
