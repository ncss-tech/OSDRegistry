HOUSTON BLACK SERIES

The Houston Black series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum derived from calcareous mudstone of Cretaceous Age. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on interfluves and side slopes on upland ridges and plains on dissected plains. Slopes are mainly 1 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F).

USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all is cultivated and used for growing cotton, sorghums, and corn. Cotton root rot is prevalent on most areas and limits cotton yields and the use of some legumes in rotations. Native vegetation consists of tall and mid grass prairies of little bluestem, big bluestem, indiangrass, switchgrass, and sideoats grama, with scattered elm, mesquite, and hackberry trees.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Land Resource Region J - Southwestern Prairies Cotton and Forage Region. East Central Texas. The Blackland Prairies (MLRAs 86A and 86B) and eastern part of the Grand Prairies (MLRA 85) of Texas. This soil is of large extent.
