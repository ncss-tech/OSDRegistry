HARSHA SERIES

The Harsha series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock.  Harsha soils are on mountain side slopes, fans, and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive Ustic Argicryids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Harsha loam - native grass.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 5 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; noncalcareous; mildly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 7 inches thick)

    B21t--5 to 13 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; thin nearly continuous clay films on peds; noncalcareous; mildly alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 20 inches thick)

    B22t--13 to 33 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) light clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; thin patchy clay films on peds; calcareous; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 23 inches thick)

    B3ca--33 to 40 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; thin patchy clay films on faces of peds; visible streaks of lime accumulation; calcareous; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)

    C--40 to 60 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; calcareous; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION:  Grand County, Colorado; about 6 miles northeast of Kremmling; approximately 550 feet north and 100 feet east of SW corner of Sec. 7, T. 2 N., R. 79 W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches and the depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 11 to 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 49 to 59 degrees F.

The A horizon hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon is typically loam but ranges to clay loam.

The B horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or loam, averages 18 to 35 percent clay, and contains more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.

The C horizon ranges from loam to clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alcova, Almy, Antonito, Bluerim, Bonfri, Cushool, Diamondville, Elk Hollow, Fluetsch, Forelle, Rawah, Rock River, Satanka, Stunner, and Wolford series.  Alcova and Elk Hollow soils have skeletal C horizons occurring above a depth of 40 inches.  Almy soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the B2t horizon.  Antonito soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bluerim, Cushool, Diamondville, Rawah, and Satanka soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Fluetsch soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and have C horizons with less than 18 percent clay.  Forelle soils have a mean summer soil temperature warmer that 59 degrees F.  Rock River soils have more than 35 percent fine sandy or coarser in the argillic horizon.  Stunner and Wolford soils have calcic horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harsha soils occupy mountain side slopes, fans, and ridges at elevations of 7,500 to 9,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 to 14 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F.; mean summer temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 35 to 75 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bearmouth, Emerald, Leavitt, Rogert, and Roxal soils.  Bearmouth soils lack argillic horizons and are skeletal.  Emerald soils have mollic epipedons and lack argillic horizons.  Leavitt soils have mollic epipedons.  Rogert soils have a lithic contact at depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Roxal soils have a paralithic contact.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for range and wildlife, with some areas being irrigated for hay.  Native vegetation is dominantly wheatgrass, needlegrass, squirreltail, big sagebrush, and rabbitbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central and northwestern Colorado.  The series is moderately extensive.
