Taxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014. 

The classification was changed from the Oxyaquic subgroup to the Aquic subgroup after an extensive landscape investigation and pedon review. 

Occurring in close association with Hamlet on convex slopes and summits in MLRA 55A is the series Souris which classifies as Oxyaquic Hapludolls, and has thin A and Bw horizons and a Bk horizon commonly found within a depth of 26 centimeters (10 inches).   This series was formerly assigned as a taxadjunct to Hamlet.

In areas near to Glacial Lake Souris, the till appears to have been reworked by water action with lenses of silts and fine sands observed in some pedons. This area may need further investigation.
