COMPETING SERIES: These are no series in this family.  When a series is established, this series placeholder will be dropped (see REMARKS).
 
GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material: loess and colluvium
Landform: backslopes and shoulders of hills 
Slope: 15 to 60 percent
Mean annual temperature: 28 to 30 degrees F.
Mean annual precipitation: 15 to 18 inches

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include Typic Dystrocryepts, Typic Haplocryolls, and Lithic Haplocryolls on similar landforms.
 
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well to well drained. Medium to very high runoff. Permeability is moderate over moderately rapid.
