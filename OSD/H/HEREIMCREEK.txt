HEREIMCREEK SERIES

The Hereimcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic rock. These soils are on drainageways, stream terraces, floodplains and valley floors in intermontane basins. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Voldseth, Groveland, Martinsdale, and Meagher soils.  The Voldseth and Groveland soils do not have gleyed horizons and occur on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Martinsdale and Meagher soils do not have redox features.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, low runoff, moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hereimcreek soils are used for rangeland and irrigated cropland. The potential native vegetation is mainly rough fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, Missouri goldenrod, needleandthread, buffalo snow berry, yarrow, prairie junegrass, forbs, and shrubs. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Hereimcreek soils are of small extent in west-central Montana. MLRA 44B, 46

SERIES PROPOSED: Meagher County, Montana 2007.  The name is from Hereimcreek creek on the Lebo Topographic Quadrangle. 

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to 22 cm (A and Bt horizons)
Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 68 cm (Bt and Btk horizons)
Calcic horizon - the zone from 42 to 125 cm (Btk2 and Bgk1 horizon)
Particle-size control section - the zone from 14 to 64 cm (Bt and part of Btk horizons)

Hereimcreek soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. 

Redoxomorphic features attributed to irrigation practices and natural stream influence.
