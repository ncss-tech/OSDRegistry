HUBTALF SERIES

The Hubtalf series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and alluvium from mixed sources. Hubtalf soils are on low terraces and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hubtalf silt loam, on nearly level pastureland at an elevation of 1870 meters. When described on August 10, 1992, the soil was moist below 20 cm and saturated below 102 cm. (Color is for air dry soil unless otherwise noted).
