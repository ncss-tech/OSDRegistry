HIGHFALLS SERIES 

The Highfalls series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, foothills, and footslopes.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid below.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 40 inches. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, glassy over mixed, superactive, frigid Alfic Udivitrands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Highfalls stony ashy silt loam, bouldery, young forest in burn area; on a south-facing slope of 38 percent at 4,100 feet elevation.  When described on May 25, 1995, the soil was moist.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Highfalls soils are mostly on south and west-facing  mountain slopes, foothills, and footslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 2,800 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Idamont, Pearsoncreek (T), Pend Oreille, Rubycreek (T), and Treble soils.  Idamont soils are on east and west-facing mountain and foothill slopes and are ashy over loamy.  Pearsoncreek soils are on south-facing mountain and foothill slopes and have a volcanic ash mantle less than 14 inches thick.  Pend Oreille soils are on north-facing mountain and foothill slopes and are ashy over loamy.  Rubycreek soils are on mountain slopes at higher elevations and are cryic.  Treble soils are on south-facing mountain and foothill slopes, are dry more than 45 days, and contain less volcanic ash. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate permeability in the upper part and moderately rapid below.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Natural vegetation is mainly grand fir, Douglas-fir, western white pine, western larch, and lodgepole pine with an understory of Saskatoon serviceberry, baldhip rose, pine reedgrass, white spirea, longtube twinflower, russet buffaloberry, creambush oceanspray, low Oregongrape, common snowberry, common princes pine, queencup beadlily, Rocky Mountain maple, and darkwoods violet.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Idaho, and possibly northwestern Montana and northeastern Washington.  This series is not extensive.
