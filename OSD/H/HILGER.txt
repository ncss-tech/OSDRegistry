HILGER SERIES

The Hilger series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or till from igneous rock and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, mountains, and moraines. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Reconnaissance Soil Survey of central Montana, 1946.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT0102, MT0898, MT0164, and MT0163.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 9 inches (A, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon from 5 to 15 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); a calcic horizon from 15 to 24 inches (Bk1, Bk2 horizons); a particle size control section from 5 to 15 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).  Hilger soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
