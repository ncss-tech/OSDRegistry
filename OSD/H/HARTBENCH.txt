HARTBENCH SERIES

The Hartbench series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash derived from granitic rocks.  These soils are on outwash fans and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 370 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Hartbench loam, in rangeland on a 4 percent slope at 1,002 meters elevation (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

    A--0 to 20 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate medium granular structure; friable, slightly hard, slightly sticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular and tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear smooth boundary.  (18 to 30 cm thick)

    Bt1--20 to 41 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; friable, hard, slightly sticky and moderately plastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular and tubular pores; common faint dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist clay films on ped faces; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 33 cm thick) 

    Bt2--41 to 56 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) clay loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic structure; firm, hard, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine and medium roots; common very fine irregular and tubular pores; common distinct dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist clay films on ped faces and along pore linings; 5 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 20 cm thick)

	BC--56 to 66 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; very friable, slightly hard, nonsticky and slightly plastic; few fine roots; common very fine irregular and interstitial pores; 15 percent gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.8); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 10 cm thick)

	C--66 to 152 cm; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/3) extremely gravelly coarse sand, light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) moist; single grained; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; moderately acid (pH 5.6).
