HODGSON SERIES

The Hodgson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits. The Hodgson soils are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Vitrandic Palexeralfs

COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Similar soil in other family is the Dearyton series. Dearyton soils do not have secondary carbonate accumulation and are isotic. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hodgson soils are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  They formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits; some areas, formed in landslide or mudflow deposits from lake sediments.  Elevations are 1,300 to 2,000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 21 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cedonia, Clayton, Hunters, Kewach, Martella, Laketon and Scala soils. Cedonia, Hunters, Martella, and Laketon soils are fine-silty. Cedonia soils are on lake terraces and terrace breaks.  Clayton and Scala soils are coarse-loamy. Kewach soils have a frigid temperature regime. Clayton, Hunters, Kewach, Martella and Scala soils are on similar landforms as the Hodgson soils. Laketon soils are on lake terraces. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow to rapid runoff; moderately slow permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Irrigated and nonirrigated cropland, woodland and grazed woodland. Small grains, alfalfa and grasses for hay and pastures are common crops. The native vegetation is ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, with an understory of common snowberry Saskatoon serviceberry, oregongrape, blue wildrye, strawberry, white stoneseed, silky lupine, white spirea, common chokecherry, and pinegrass. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northeastern Washington. MLRA 43A. The series is of moderate extent.
