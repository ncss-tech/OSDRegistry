HETCHY SERIES

The Hetchy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Hetchy soils are on hills and ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Gardellones, Gopheridge, Hurleton, and Oroshore soils. Gardellones soils lack a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm and are 100 to 150 cm to a lithic contact of metavolcanic bedrock. Gopheridge soils are 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact of metavolcanic bedrock. Hurleton soils are 50 to 100 cm to a lithic contact of intrusive igneous rock and have sandy loam and sandy clay loam textures in the lower Bt horizons. Oroshore soils lack a lithic contact between 100 and 150 cm.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hetchy soils are on hills and ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. Elevation is 225 to 1060 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 685 to 1015 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 190 to 315 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Deerflat, Luckymine, Millvilla, and Priestgrade soils. The Deerflat soils are deeper than 150 cm to bedrock and are found on baseslopes. Luckymine and Priestgrade soils are less than 50 cm to bedrock and are on nose slopes and crests. Millvilla soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on side slopes.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high throughout the soil profile.
