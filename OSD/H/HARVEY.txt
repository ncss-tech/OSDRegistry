HARVEY SERIES

The Harvey series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium and windblown sediments derived dominantly from sandstone, shale, and limestone. Harvey soils are on hills, swales, plateaus, bajadas, mesas, and fan piedmonts .  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Harvey loam - rangeland.   (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.

    A--0 to 7 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and very fine roots; common fine interstitial pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)

    Bw--7 to 11 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, slightly sticky and plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (0 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk1--11 to 16 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; calcium carbonates segregated as common medium irregular masses and seams; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 15 inches thick)

    Bk2--16 to 37 inches; pink (7.5YR 7/4) clay loam, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) moist; weak medium prismatic structure parting to weak medium subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; violently effervescent; calcium carbonates segregated as many coarse irregular masses and seams; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (15 to 30 inches thick)

    Bk3--37 to 60 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate segregated as common medium masses; moderately alkaline.

TYPE LOCATION: Torrance County, New Mexico; 400 feet west and 60 feet north of the southeast corner, sec. 13 T. 3N., R. 10E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture: Soil moisture control section - Moist periodically during the months of June to October and December to February and are moist for at least 15 days after the soil temperature reaches 41 degrees F. The moisture control section is dry for extended periods between average maximums in most years.

Depth to calcic horizon: 5 to 24 inches.
Soil Temperature: 49 to 59 degrees F.
Clay averages 18 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section.
Rock fragments: 0 to 15 percent weighted average.
Soil Reaction: Slightly to moderately alkaline. In Utah reaction ranges to strongly alkaline.

A horizon 
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist
Chroma: 2 to 6
Texture: Sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, channery fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or gravelly loam.

Bw horizon (where present)
Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR
Value: 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma: 2 to 4
Texture: fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam

Bk horizon 
Hue: 2.5YR to 10YR
Value: 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist
Chroma: 0 to 6
Texture: Sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam
Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 40 percent
In some pedons textures of gravelly sandy loam or gravelly sandy clay loam occur.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abracon (UT), ThumbRock (UT), Chroder (CO), Chugcity (T WY), Chupadera (NM), Cobbra (T UT), Milok (UT), Mivida (UT), Nala (NM), Sazi (UT), and Yattle (CO). 

Abracon, Chroder, and Cobbra soils have soil moisture control sections that receive less precipitation in May and June.  ThumbRock, Chugcity, Chupadera, and Sazi soils are moderately deep. Chroder, Milok, Mivida and Yattle soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Nala soils have more than 15% rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harvey soils are on hills, swales, plateaus, bajadas, mesas, and fan piedmonts. Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 10 to 14 inches with a summer maximum. In some areas the series has ranged to 16 inches of precipitation. In Utah the annual precipitation ranges as low as 8 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 190 days and elevation ranges from 4,700 to 7,800 feet.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clapper, Dean, Ildefonso, Korman, Manzano, Neesopah, Nepesta, Pinon, Rocky Ford and Witt soils. Clapper and Ildefonso soils have a skeletal control section. Dean soils have carbonatic mineralogy. Korman soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Manzano soils have a mollic epipedon. Neesopah, Nepesta and Witt soils have an argillic horizon. Pinon soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface. Rocky Ford soils have a fine-silty family control section.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 15 percent slopes.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for livestock grazing and
irrigated cropland. Common crops are alfalfa, melons, truck crops and small grains. Blue grama, galleta, sand dropseed, winterfat, cactus, yucca, sagebrush, and juniper are the principal plants.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern New Mexico, Utah and southwestern
Colorado and Montana. This soil is of large extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Prowers County, Colorado, 1963.

REMARKS: Classification change from fine-loamy family to coarse loamy family is based on four sets of NSSL data as follows: S82AZ-015-034 (82P0878), S83NM-019-002 and 003 (83P0851 and 83P0852), and S91NM-057-005 (92P0337). Total clay averages greater than 18 percent but silicate clay averages less than 18 percent.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon: 0 to 7 inches. (A horizon). When this horizon meets the color requirements of a mollic epipedon, it fails to meet the thickness requirements.
Calcic horizons: 11 to 37 inches. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).

Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.
