HARROD SERIES

The Harrod series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick overlying limestone or dolostone. These soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Hapludolls

TYPICAL PEDON: Harrod silt loam, on a 1 percent slope in a pasture field at an elevation of 288 meters (945 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 A--0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches); very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; weak fine and very fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine and very fine roots, common medium roots; few fine prominent white (10YR 8/1) masses of calcium carbonate in the matrix; very slightly effervescent; slightly alkaline; clear smooth boundary. [25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick]

 Bw1--28 to 36 cm (11 to 14 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common medium to very fine roots; common faint very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic coatings on faces of peds; few fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) masses of iron and manganese accumulation in the matrix; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary.

 Bw2--36 to 48 cm (14 to 19 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; weak medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; friable; common fine and very fine roots; few distinct very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) organic coatings on faces of peds; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and distinct brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; few faint black (10YR 2/1) masses of manganese accumulation on faces of peds; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary.

 Bw3--48 to 69 cm (19 to 27 inches); dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine and very fine roots; few faint gray (10YR 5/1) iron depletions on faces of peds; common fine prominent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and few fine prominent reddish brown (5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation in the matrix; few faint black (10YR 2/1) masses of manganese accumulation on faces of peds; 4 percent limestone fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear wavy boundary. [Combined thickness of the Bw horizon is 18 to 43 cm (7 to 17 inches).]

 Bg--69 to 79 cm (27 to 31 inches); gray (10YR 5/1) sandy clay loam with strata of sandy loam; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; friable; few prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) masses of iron accumulation on faces of peds and in the matrix; 2 percent angular limestone channers; 9 percent subangular limestone fragments; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. [8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) thick]

 2R--79 cm (31 inches); white (10YR 8/1) limestone.

TYPE LOCATION: Allen County, Ohio; about .5 mile east of Westminster, in Auglaize Township; about 1440 feet north and 1550 feet east of the southwest corner of sec. 17, T. 4 S., R. 8 E.; USGS Harrod, Ohio topographic quadrangle; lat. 40 degrees 41 minutes 33 seconds N. and long. 83 degrees 58 minutes 14 seconds W., NAD 27.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

A or Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 2 or 3 (5 or less dry)

Reaction: neutral or slightly alkaline

Bw horizon:
Hue: 10YR

Bg horizon:

Rock fragments: 5 to 15 percent fragments less than 8 cm (3 inches) in diameter; 0 to 25 percent cobbles and channers of limestone or dolostone
Reaction: neutral to moderately alkaline

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Medway and Shaffton series. These soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Harrod soils are on narrow flood plains along streams in areas of Wisconsin glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy alluvium overlying limestone or dolostone. The source of the alluvium is calcareous, loamy drift of Wisconsin age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 135 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained Medway and the very poorly drained Sloan soils on flood plains. The somewhat poorly drained Blount and the moderately well drained Glynwood soils are on slight rises, knolls, and ridges on nearby till plains.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate.

USE AND VEGETATION: A large proportion is being kept in pasture, woodland, or grassland. A relatively small proportion is in cropland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest, primarily elm, ash, sycamore, silver maple, and willow.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Ohio; MLRA 111B. The series is of small extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Hancock County, Ohio, 1997.

REMARKS: Harrod soils are being converted from Sloan and Millsdale soils during modernization projects in MLRA 111B.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Mollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 28 cm (A horizon).
Cambic horizon: from a depth of 28 to 79 cm (Bw, Bg horizons).
Lithic contact: at 79 cm (top of the 2R layer).
Aquic conditions: redox features in horizons between a depth of 36 and 79 cm.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for AL-127, the typical pedon.
