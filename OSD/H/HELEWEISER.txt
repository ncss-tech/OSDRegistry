HELEWEISER SERIES

The Heleweiser series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Heleweiser soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Typic Haplocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Heleweiser very gravelly sandy loam, rangeland and wildlife habitat. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.) The soil surface is covered by approximately 50 percent pebbles and 2 percent cobbles.

Gypsum content: 1 to 3 percent. 

COMPETING SERIES: They are the Gunsight and Chemehuevi series. Gunsight soils do not have secondary gypsum in the lower part of the control sections. Chemehuevi soils have a soil temperature of 78 to 83 degrees. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Heleweiser soils are on fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,150 to 2,700 feet. The climate is low latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches, the mean annual temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 360 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carrizo and Teebar (T) soils. Carrizo soils are sandy-skeletal and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons. Teebar soils are loamy-skeletal, very shallow to petrocalcic horizons, and have carbonatic mineralogy. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; very low or low runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly creosotebush, white bursage, range ratany, King's desertgrass and big galleta. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Mojave Desert of southeastern Nevada. MLRA 30. These soils are not extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Clark County Area, Nevada, 2006. Proposed in  Clark County, Nevada, 1997. The name is coined. 

REMARKS: The superactive cation exchange activity class is estimated. Laboratory data is needed to confirm this placement. 

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: 

Ochric epipedon - 0 to 7 inches (A, Bw and part of the Bk1 horizons). 

Calcic horizon - 11 to 34 inches (Bk2 and Bky1 horizons).
