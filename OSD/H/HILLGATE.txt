HILLGATE SERIES

The Hillgate series consists of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. They are on low terraces with slopes of 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.

TYPE LOCATION: Colusa County, California; about 4.5 miles west of Maxwell; 2,400 feet south and 2,500 feet east of the northwest corner of sec. 2, T. 16 N., R. 4 W., MDB&M; 39 degrees, 16 minutes, 10 seconds North Latitude and 121 degrees, 16 minutes, 20 seconds West Longitude, USGS Sites CA quadrangle. 

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 63 to 65 degrees F and the soil temperature is not below 47 at any time. The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is dry in all parts from May 15 to October 31 and moist in some or all parts from November 1 to May 15. Weighted average clay content for the 19 to 39 inch textural control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay. The solum ranges from 60 to 75 inches thick.

The A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4  and moist color of 10YR 5/3, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or clay loam. Reaction is strongly to slightly acid. 

The Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/6, 6/3, 5/8, 5/6, 5/4, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/8, 5/6, 5/5, 5/4, 4/6 and moist color of 10YR 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4. Texture is clay loam or clay. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cometa, Corning, Hytop, Millsap, Orognen, San Ysidro and Yokayo series. Cometa has a solumn thickness of 24 to 40 inches and the Bt includes 5YR colors. The Corning series has Bt colors of 2.5YR or 5YR. The Hytop series has a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Millsap has a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Orognen has 5YR Bt colors. Yokayo has a solumn thickness of 30 to 50 inches, mean annual air temperature of 57 degrees F. and precipitation of 32 to 44 inches.
Hillgate needs to be competed with San Ysidro during MLRA update.  The soils are the same, but Hillgate is mapped on slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The San Ysidro is mapped on 0 to 9 percent slopes and may need to be combined with Hillgate on 0 to 9 percent slopes.  Colusa County holds the Hillgate type location which was lab sampled.  In Colusa the Hillgate is mapped on 0 to 9 percent slopes.  The Hillgate on 9 to 50 percent slopes (in Eastern Santa Clara County) would then be a new series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hillgate soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping old terraces at elevations of 15-2,000 feet. The soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. The climate is semiarid to subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation varies from 14 to 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 65 degrees F. Average January temperature is about 44 degrees and the average July temperature is about 80 degrees F. Average frost free season is about 185 to 300 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arbuckle, Corning, Kimball, Myers, Tehama, San Ysidro and Zamora soils. Arbuckle, Tehama and Zamora soils all have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Kimball soils have a mollic epipedon. Myers soils are fine textured throughout. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well to moderately well drained. negligable to very high runoff, very slow and slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Where cultivated, small grains, irrigated pasture, shallow rooted row crops and rice. Areas not cultivated, annual grasses and forbs with open stands of valley and blue oaks.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West side of Sacramento Valley and Coast Range valleys, soils are of moderate extent. MLRA 15, 14 and into MLRA 17.
