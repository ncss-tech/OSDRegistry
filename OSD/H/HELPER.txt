HELPER SERIES

The Helper series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum weathered from sedimentary rock.  Helper soils are on mountainsides, ridges and canyons.  Slopes range from 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 47 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  Bozeman, Montana

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Carbon County, Utah, Carbon Area, Utah soil survey area, 2011.  The name is from the nearby railroad town of Helper.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Series control section:  The zone from 0 to 99 cm.
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 89 cm.  (Bw, Bk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 cm.  (A horizon)
Cambic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 89 cm.  (Bw and Bk horizons)
Secondary carbonates:  The zone from 38 to 89 cm.  (Bk horizons)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered bedrock at 89 cm.  (Cr horizon)

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.

Lithologic discontinuities have not been recognized in this series.  Texture and/or color changes in C or BC horizons have been attributed to the inherent interbedded nature of the parent material.
