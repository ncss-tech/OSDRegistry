HARLEM SERIES

The Harlem series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified clayey calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Harlem soils are on flood plains.  Elevations are 1,900 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in stratified clayey, calcareous alluvium.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls in the spring and early part of summer.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days.  In Colorado elevations are 6,000 to 6,800 feet and the frost free period is 75 to 95 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; slow or very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Harlem soils are used for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland.  Some areas are used for range.  The potential native vegetation is mainly green needlegrass, bluebunch wheatgrass, western wheatgrass, forbs, and shrubs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Harlem soils are extensive in the plains area of Montana and Colorado and possibly the adjacent states.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Soil Survey of Milk River Area, Montana, 1928.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation records:  MT0101, MT0186, MT0187, MT0232, MT1008.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (Ap horizon); soil horizons that are calcareous from the soil surface to 60 inches (Ap, C1, C2, C3 horizons); stratification of soil material (C1, C2, C3 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (C1, C2 horizons).  Harlem soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.

Type location should be moved to an area considered to have an aridic moisture regime that borders on ustic.  Blaine County is considered to have an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
