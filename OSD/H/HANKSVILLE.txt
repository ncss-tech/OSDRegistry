HANKSVILLE SERIES

The Hanksville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, colluvium, and slope alluvium derived from shale.  Hanksville soils are on hillslopes, eroding shale hills, lower terraces, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches (178mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F (10C).

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Fine, mixed, active, calcareous, mesic Typic Torriorthents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hanksville clay loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

    A--0 to 18 cm; olive gray (5Y 4/2) clay loam, dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) moist; weak thick platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; very few fine roots; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.  (5 to 18 cm thick)

    Cy--18 to 46 cm; olive gray (5Y 4/2) clay loam, dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) moist; massive; hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; few very fine roots; few veins of salt and gypsum; slightly effervescent; calcium carbonate is disseminated; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); gradual smooth boundary.  (20 to 50 cm thick)

    Cyk--46 to 99 cm; olive gray (5Y 4/2) silty clay, dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) moist; massive; hard, very firm, sticky and plastic; threads of salt and gypsum; strongly effervescent; calcium carbonate in veins and disseminated; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); clear wavy boundary.  (30 to 53 cm thick)

    Cr--99 cm; soft fractured shale.

TYPE LOCATION:  Wayne County, Utah; northwest l/4, northeast l/4 sec. l6, T. 28 S., R. l0 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture regime:  Aridic
Mean annual soil temperature: 47 to 56 degrees F. (8 to 13 C.)
Depth to paralithic contact:  50 to 100 cm to weathered shale
Thickness of the ochric epipedon:  5 to 18 cm
Organic matter content: 0.1 to 0.5 percent in the A and C horizons

Particle-size control section (weighted average):  
Clay content:  35 to 55 percent

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR to 5Y
Value:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4
Calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE): 5 to 25 percent
Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR): 2 to 5 
Salinity (mmhos/cm): EC 2 to 8
Gypsum: 1 to 10 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline

Cy or Cyk horizon: (BCy or BCyk in some pedons)
Hue:  10YR to 5Y
Value:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist
Chroma:  1 to 4
Texture:  SICL, CL, SIC, or C
Clay content:  35 to 55 percent
Pararock fragments:  0 to 90 percent soft shale fragments
Calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE): 5 to 25 percent
Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR): 2 to 13 
Salinity (mmhos/cm): EC 2 to 16 
Gypsum: 1 to 10 percent
Reaction:  moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline
Calcium carbonate, gypsum and other salts present are believed to be dominantly geogenic, and not pedogenic accumulations.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Notal and Yuba series.  
Notal and Yuba: very deep

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  residuum, colluvium, and slope alluvium derived from shale
Landform:  alluvial fans, eroding shale hills, hillslopes, and lower terraces
Slopes:  0 to 50 percent
Elevation:  4,000 to 6,800 feet (1,220 to 2,100 meters)
Mean annual temperature:  44 to 54 degrees F (6.7 to 12.2 C.)
Mean annual precipitation:  5 to 9 inches (127 to 229 mm)
Precipitation pattern:  precipitation is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year
Frost-free period:  110 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chipeta and Leebench series.  The Chipeta soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 13 to 50 cm.  The Leebench soils are very deep and have a natric horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained, high to very high runoff, slow to very slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  The soils are used for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The potential vegetation is dominantly saltbush, shadscale, Indian ricegrass, and galleta.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Eastern Utah and western Colorado; LRR D, MLRA 34 and 35; The series is of minor extent.

REMARKS: 
Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Particle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 99 cm.  (Cy and Cyk horizons)
Ochric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 18 cm.  (A horizon)
Paralithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 99 cm.  (Cr horizon)

Calcium carbonate, gypsum and other salts present are believed to be dominantly geogenic, and not pedogenic accumulations.

The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.
