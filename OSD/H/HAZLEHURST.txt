HAZLEHURST SERIES

The Hazlehurst series consists of somewhat poorly drained, nearly level soils on uplands of the Coastal Plains.  These soils have grayish loamy sand A and E horizons, loamy B horizons and firm, brittle Bx horizons containing more than 5 percent plinthite.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 49 inches.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 100 inches.  Depth to horizons with dense or brittle properties ranges from 19 to 36 inches.  All horizons are very strongly acid or strongly acid except for surface layers that have been limed.  Ironstone nodules range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and E horizons, 2 to 10 percent in the Btv horizons and 7 to 30 percent in the Btvx horizons. Clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent and silt content is less than 20 percent.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand or sand.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or 3; or it is neutral with value of 5, 6 or 7.  It is loamy sand or sand.

The Bt1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6.  Mottles are few to many in shades of gray, yellow, brown and red.  Plinthite is 0 to 4 percent.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

The Btv horizon has hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5, 6 or 7 and chroma of 3, 4 or 6 in the upper part and 1 through 6 below, or it is neutral with value of 5, 6 or 7.  Mottles are few to many in shades of gray, yellow, brown and red.  Plinthite is 5 to 20 percent.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

The Btgv horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5, 6 or 7.  Mottles are common or many in shades of gray, yellow, brown or red.  Plinthite is 5 to 20 percent.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.

This horizon has dense and brittle properties in 10 to 40 percent by volume, mostly in materials in shade of brown and red that has platy structure.  It is sandy clay loam or loam, clay loam or loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clarendon, Escambia, Kirbyville, and Saucier of the same family and the Alapaha, Ardilla, Atmore, Basin, Ellabelle, Lynchburg, Mashulaville, Pansey, Robertsdale, Surrency, and Stough series.  Clarendon and Kirbyville soils do not have dense properties.  Saucier and Robertsdale soils have more than 20 percent silt in the control section.  Alapaha, Ellabelle, and Surrency soils have an arenic epipedon.  Ardilla soils have a Btx horizon with 40 to 60 percent brittle properties.  Atmore and Pansey soils are gleyed immediately below the A horizon.  Basin, Escambia and Stough soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Lynchburg soils do not have plinthite.  Mashulaville soils do not have matrix chromas of 3 or more and do not have plinthite.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hazlehurst soils are nearly level and in slightly depressional upland areas in the Atlantic Coastal Plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soil developed in marine deposits of medium texture.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual air temperature is about 60 to 70 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 to 55 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Alapaha, Ardilla, Atmore, Clarendon, Lynchburg, and Robertsdale series, and the Leefield series.  Leefield soils are arenic.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Slow runoff; slow permeability.  The soil is saturated to depths of 6 to 24 inches for 2 to 6 months during winter and spring.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Cleared areas are used for growing pasture grasses, corn, small grain, soybeans, and truck crops.  Native vegetation is slash, longleaf, and loblolly pine, sweetgum, and some other hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.  The series is of moderate extent.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Appling County, Georgia; 1969.

REMARKS: This series is classified as Aeric Paleaquults.  With the plinthic feature, it would be classified as Plinthic Aeric Paleaquults if that subgroup was in Soil Taxonomy.  The soil moisture regime has features like the Aeric Paleaquults.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:
Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (Ap, E horizons).
Albic horizon - the zone from approximately 8 to 13 inches (E horizon).
Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 13 to 63 inches (Btv, Btgv, Btvx1, Btvx2, Btvx3).
Fragic feature - the zone with 10 to 40 percent dense and brittle properties from approximately 24 to 63 inches (Btvx1, Btvx2, Btvx3 horizons).
Plinthic feature - the zone with 5 percent or more plinthite from approximately 13 to 63 inches (Btv, Btgv, Btvx1, Btvx2, Btvx3 horizons).
