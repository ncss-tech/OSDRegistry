HYMAS SERIES

The Hymas series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone.  The Hymas soils are on mountainsides, ridges or uplands.  Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, carbonatic, frigid Lithic Haploxerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hymas extremely stony loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 4 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; about 5 percent gravel and 15 percent stones; strongly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 6 inches thick)

    A2--4 to 7 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely stony loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; about 5 percent gravel and 15 percent stones; strongly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary. (2 to 10 inches thick)

    C1--7 to 14 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) gravelly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; about 25 percent gravel and 5 percent stones; violently effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); gradual wavy boundary.  (2 to 10 inches thick)

    C2--14 to 18 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) very gravelly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine pores; about 30 percent gravel and 10 percent stones; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    2R--18 to 30 inches; gray (N 5/) fractured limestone bedrock, very dark gray (N 3/) moist.

TYPE LOCATION:  Bingham County, Idaho; approximately 2 miles north and one mile west of the mouth of Wolverine Canyon, about 1,980 feet west and 165 feet south of the northeast corner of section 35, T. 1 S., R. 38 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil moisture - Moist in late fall, winter and spring; dry from late June through September.

Soil temperature - 42 to 47 degrees F.
Average summer soil temperature - 59 to 66 degrees F.
Mollic epipedon thickness - 7 to 14 inches.
Depth to bedrock - 10 to 20 inches.

Control section
Clay content:  8 to 27 percent.
Rock fragments:  35 to 80 percent dominantly angular fragments of limestone.

A horizon
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3 moist and dry.
Reaction:  Neutral through moderately alkaline.

C horizon
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y.
Value:  5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist.
Chroma:  2 or 3 moist or dry.
Rock fragments:  Average 35 to 80 percent.
Reaction:  Mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hyzen (T) series.  Hyzen soils lack C horizons.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hymas soils are on mountainsides,  ridges and uplands. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone with some loess influence.  Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 4,500 to 8,000 feet (9,000 feet in Nevada).  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches; mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 60 to 110 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aspen, Highams, Ricrest, Ridgecrest, and Wahtigup soils.  Aspen, Ricrest, Ridgecrest and Wahtigup soils are more than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Highams soils lack a mollic epipedon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium or rapid runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, cheatgrass, phlox, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, rabbitbrush and bitterbrush.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southeast Idaho and high elevations of northeast Nevada.  These soils are moderately extensive.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Bingham County, Idaho, 1972.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:

Mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to 7 inches (the A1 and A2 horizons).

Lithic contact - The boundary between the soil and bedrock at about 18 inches.

Particle-size control section - The zone from 10 inches to 18 inches (the C2 horizon and part of the C1 horizon).
