HARDSHOULDER SERIES


The Hardshoulder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash. Hardshoulder soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

Euell soils have bedrock at 100 to 152 cm. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hardshoulder soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.   Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,505 to 3,245 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atastra, competing Lastsummer and Roughridge series. Atastra soils have less than 35 percent rock fragment in their particle-size control section.  Roughridge soils have an aridic soil moisture regime and have a frigid soil temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability; high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: Hardshoulder soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation, watershed and wildlife habitat. The native vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, gilia, buckwheat, pine needlegrass, prairie junegrass and Indian ricegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Eastern California, east of the Sierra Nevada Range. These soils are not extensive.  MLRA 26.
