HALLECK SERIES

The Halleck series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Halleck soils are on axial stream flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Cumulic Endoaquolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Halleck silt loam-hay meadow.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

   Ap--0 to 10 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); abrupt smooth boundary. (0 to 18 cm thick)

   A1--10 to 23 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silt loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; strong fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 7.9); clear smooth boundary.  (8 to 30 cm thick)

   A2--23 to 43 cm; dark gray (10YR 4/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and fine, few medium roots; common very fine interstitial and fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary.  (10 to 30 cm thick)

   A3--43 to 91 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) silty clay loam, black (10YR 2/1) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.1); clear smooth boundary.  (13 to 64 cm thick)

   A4--91 to 140 cm; gray (10YR 5/1) clay loam, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) moist; common medium, distinct, brown (10YR 4/3) iron redox concentrations; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3); abrupt smooth boundary.  (0 to 64 cm thick)

   Cg--140 to 153 cm; greenish gray (5GY 6/1) clay loam, dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) moist; few fine, faint, dark gray (5Y 4/1) redox concentrations; massive; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common very fine interstitial pores; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.3).

TYPE LOCATION:  Elko County, Nevada; approximately 2 miles north of Lamoille; about 700 feet north and 2,200 feet west of the southeast corner of section 8, T. 33 N., R. 58 E.; USGS Halleck SW 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; latitude 40 degrees 45 minutes 11 seconds N and  longitude 115 degrees 27 minutes 34 seconds ; WGS 84 Decimal Degrees 40.7530556 north latitude, -115.4586111.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: Saturated at or near the surface for at least one month during most years, mainly during the late winter through early summer months.
Mean annual soil temperature: 6 to 8 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness: 79 to 150 cm.
Reaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.
Effervence: Slightly effervescent through violently effervescent.

Particle-size control section - Clay content:  20 to 35 percent.
Sand fraction: Less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.

A horizon  
Value:  4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.
Chroma:  1 or 2 dry and moist.
Other features:  Thin strata of clay loam or loam are present in the lower subhorizons of some pedons.  Buried A1 horizons are in many pedons.

C horizon  
Hue:  5GY, 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR.
Value:  5 through 7 dry.
Chroma:  1 or 2.
Texture:  Average loam to silty clay loam, but are dominantly clay loam or silty clay loam with less than 15 percent by weight of fine sand or coarser particles.
Other features:  Gravelly substratums or drained phases are recognized.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bigstone, Bloomington, Downata, Hidewood, Homefield, Inkom, Lamoure, Opie, Playmoor and Rauville series. 

Bigstone soils are very poorly drained. Downata soils have Bg horizons with Hue that are 2.5Y or N and 2Agb horizons with Hue that is 2.5Y, 5Y or N.  Hidewood formed in loess over glacial till. Inkom soils have a mollic epipedon that is 60 to 80 cm thick and Bg horizons with Hue that are 2.5Y, 5Y or N. Homefield have a 2C horizon with 40 to 60 percent clay and textures of clay or silty clay. Lamoure soils have a high water table at a depth of 60 to 150 cm from October to June and are moist in the moisture control section from June to October following the recession of the water table. Opie soils have A horizons that are strongly or very strongly alkaline. Playmoor soils have salt accumulations (4 to 16 mm per cm) in the upper 50 cm of the soil.  Rauville soils have a granular mollic epipedon and a high water table at a depth of 0 to 60 cm throughout the year.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Halleck soils are on axial stream flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,525 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bloor, Hussa and Sonoma series.  The Bloor and Sonoma soils have ochric epipedons.  Hussa soils have 30 to 60 cm thick mollic epipedons.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained.  Very slow runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Rangeland, hayland and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly sedges, tufted hairgrass, Sandberg bluegrass and clover.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeast Elko County Nevada.  These soils are not extensive. MLRA 25.
