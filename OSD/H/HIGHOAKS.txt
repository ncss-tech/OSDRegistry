RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: 

Soil moisture: The soil moisture control section is dry from July 1st to October 15th and moist in all parts from November 15 to June 1st. This soil has a xeric soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature is 6 degrees C or greater. This soil has a mesic soil temperature regime

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Buckpeak(WA), Centralia and Flyat series.  The Buckwheat and Centralia soils have 7.5YR colors throughout the subsurface horizons.  Flyat has an Umbric epipedon.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountain slopes with slopes of 9 to 50 percent. They are on linear and convex slope positions at elevations of 35 to 1200 meters (115 to 3937 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2030 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).The frost free period is about 150 to 250 days. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Mudhorse and Noisy series. Mudhorse soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features between 50 and 100 centimeters from the soil surface. Noisy soils are loamy-skeletal with greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section.  The Mudhorse soils are generally found in concave slope positions.  The Noisy soils are generally found in slightly to strongly convex slope positions.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well-drained; high runoff; moderately high to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is mostly used for livestock grazing, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Natural vegetation is Oregon white oak with an understory of bristly dogtail grass, woodland strawberry, creeping snowberry and poison oak. Douglas-fir invades readily in the absence of fire and grazing.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Siskyou-Trinity Area, MLRA 5. The name is coined. The series is of small extent.
