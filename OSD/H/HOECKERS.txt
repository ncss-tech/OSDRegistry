SERIES PROPOSED: Galveston County, Texas, 2022. The name is from a geographic location (Hoeckers Point) on Galveston Island.

REMARKS: The series was formerly included with water.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are--
Particle-size control section--0 to 100 cm (0 to 40 inches) 
Ochric epipedon--0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (^Aseg horizon) 
Sulfidic soil materials--0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (^Aseg horizon)
Loamy-skeletal particle size class--35 percent or more shell fragments (thickest part of the control section) from 0 to 61 cm (0 to 24 inches) - ^Aseg and ^Cg1 horizons.
Peraquic feature--0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 inches) (^Aseg horizon and ^Cg layers are permanently saturated)

Additional Comments--Mineralogy based on the amount of shell fragments in the fine-earth fraction.
