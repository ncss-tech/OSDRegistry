HUCKLE SERIES

The Huckle series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains. They formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metasedimentary bedrock (predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite), with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 6.5 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic, frigid Typic Udivitrands

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ardenvoir and Saint Maries  soils. Ardenvoir soils are loamy-skeletal, do not have a thick volcanic ash mantle, and are on adjacent south aspects of mountains. Saint Maries soils do not have a thick volcanic ash mantle, are very deep, and are on east and west aspects of concave mountain backslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderate saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat, and watershed. Potential natural overstory vegetation is mainly western red cedar, grand fir, Douglas fir, western white pine, and western larch and with an understory of queencup beadlily, longtube twinflower, starry false Solomons-seal, hooker fairybells, Idaho goldthread, pacific trillium, darkwoods violet, myrtle pachystima, and western rattlesnake plantain.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Idaho and possibly eastern Washington; MLRA 43A. This series is of large extent.
