HATCHIE SERIES

The Hatchie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low stream terraces in the Coastal Plain region.  The soil formed in a mantle of loess over loamy alluvium.  The soil has a fragipan in the lower subsoil.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, siliceous, active, thermic Aquic Fraglossudalfs

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hatchie silt loam - pasture
(Colors are for moist soils unless otherwise states.)

     Ap--0 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; common medium faint light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), common medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/2), and common medium prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; weak fine and medium granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; common iron and manganese stains; slightly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.   (5 to 9 inches thick)

     Bt1--7 to 13 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; few fine distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) mottles; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few very fine roots; few fine and very fine discontinuous pores; few iron and manganese concretions and stains; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

     Bt2--13 to 19 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silt loam; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) and few medium distinct light gray (10YR 7/1) mottles; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine pores; few iron and manganese concretions and nodules; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt ranges from 12 to 25 inches)

     B/E--19 to 26 inches; Btx part, mottled light gray (10YR 7/1), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm, brittle; few fine discontinuous pores; E part, light gray (10YR 7/1) silt loam; common medium faint gray (10YR 6/1) and common fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6), and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) mottles; weak fine granular structure; friable; few fine pores; common iron and manganese concretions and nodules; strongly acid; clear irregular boundary.  (3 to 8 inches thick)

     2Btx1--26 to 38 inches; mottled light gray (10YR 7/1), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam; moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm, brittle; common prominent clay films on faces of prisms and peds; light gray vertical seams 1/8 to 1 1/2 inches wide of silt and silt loam; few fine discontinuous pores; few dark iron and manganese concretions and stains; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.

     2Btx2--38 to 57 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam; common medium distinct light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) mottles; weak very coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; firm, brittle; common prominent clay films on faces of prisms and peds; light gray vertical seams 1/8 to 1 1/2 inches wide of silt and silt loam; few fine discontinuous pores; few dark iron and manganese concretions and stains; very strongly acid; gradual smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Btx horizons range from 20 to 40 inches)

     2Bt--57 to 78 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam, common medium prominent gray (10YR 6/1) mottles; weak coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; friable; few fine distinct clay films on faces of prisms and peds; few fine dark stains; strongly acid.

TYPE LOCATION:  McNairy County, Tennessee, 0.4 mile south of Ramer, 1600 feet south of the intersection of TN 234 and Mt. Vernon Road, 0.5 mile northeast of intersection of TN 234 and Muddy Creek, 1000 feet east of intersection of TN 234 and farm path in pasture.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum exceeds 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from about 18 to 32 inches. Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid except where lime has been added.  Content of sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section is more than 15 percent. Few to common dark manganese and iron concretions are present in most pedons.

The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam.

The Bt horizon, or Bw horizon, where present has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles in shades of gray or brown range from few to many.  Texture is silt loam or rarely, silty clay loam.

The E material has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Commonly there are mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  Texture is silt loam.

The Btx or 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 with common to many mottles in shades of gray, yellow or brown. In many pedons, the 2Btx horizon has no dominant matrix color.   Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.

The 2Bt horizon, if present, has colors similar to those given for the Btx horizon. Texture is loam, clay loam, or silt loam.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fluker and Woodmont soils in the same family and the Bude, Calloway, Freeland, Necessity, Olivier and Taft series in related families.  Fluker and Woodmont soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section; and in addition Woodmont soils formed in loess over limestone, and do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Bude, Calloway, Necessity and Olivier soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Calloway soils have less than 10 percent sand in the control section.  Freeland soils do not have mottles of chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon or within 16 inches of the soil surface.  Taft soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hatchie soils are on broad level and nearly level stream terraces in the Coastal Plain region. The upper part of the soil formed in a silty mantle of loess over loamy alluvium from coastal plain uplands.  Average annual temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F. and average annual precipitation ranges from 49 to 55 inches.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the moderately well drained Freeland soils and the poorly drained Almo and Guyton soils that are adjacent to Hatchie soils on terraces.  The somewhat poorly drained Falaya and Iuka soils and poorly drained Waverly and Bibb soils are a few feet lower on adjacent bottomlands.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability above the fragipan; slow permeability in the fragipan.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used as cropland.  The main crops are soybeans, corn and cotton.  Some areas are used as pasture.  The original vegetation was mixed hardwoods.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Coastal Plain Region of Western Tennessee and possibly in Alabama and Mississippi.  The series is of moderate extent.

REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to about 7 inches.

Argillic horizon - the zone from about 7 to 60 inches, except the part between 19 to 26 inches (argillic above the pan is not diagnostic.)

Fragipan - 26 to 60 inches

Aquic conditions - episaturation of layers above the Btx, redox depletions of chroma of 2 or less within 10 inches of the argillic and redox concentrations of iron and manganese throughout the matrix with highest concentrations above the fragipan.

Glossic horizon- the zone from about 19 inches to 26 inches.
