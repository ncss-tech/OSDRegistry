HAYNAP SERIES

The Haynap series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on moraines.  They formed in ash and scoria.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Ashy-skeletal, glassy over amorphic Humic Vitricryands

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haynap very gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand - on a 10 percent convex, southeast-facing slope at 3500 feet elevation.  (When described (7/18/85), the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise noted.)

    Oi--0 to 2 inches; slightly decomposed litter of Douglas fir, white fir, leaves, and twigs.

    A1--2 to 5 inches; black (10YR 2/1) very gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, grayish brown (10YR 5/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.

    A2--5 to 17 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, brown (10YR 4/3) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and fine and common medium and few coarse roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 40 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 20 inches)

    2C1--17 to 20 inches; black (10YR 2/1) extremely gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine and medium irregular pores; 70 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    2C2--20 to 22 inches; black and dark yellowish brown (10YR 2/1, 3/6) extremely gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, gray and yellowish brown (10YR 5/1, 5/6) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine and medium irregular pores; 70 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

    2C3--22 to 31 inches; black (10YR 2/1) extremely gravelly ashy loamy coarse sand, gray (10YR 5/1) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine roots; many fine and medium irregular pores; 80 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.0); abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the 2C horizon is 11 to 21 inches)

    3C4--31 to 43 inches; very dark gray (10YR 3/1) ashy loamy fine sand, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear irregular boundary.

    3C5--43 to 51 inches; black (10YR 2/1) ashy loamy fine sand, very dark gray (10YR 3/1) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium roots; many very fine irregular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); clear irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of the 3C horizon is 16 to 35 inches)

    4C6--51 to 64 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) ashy sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; single grain; loose, nonsticky and nonplastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; many very fine irregular pores; 2 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2).

TYPE LOCATION:  Jefferson County, Oregon; 0.2 mile off of USFS road 1210 in roadcut, southwest quarter of the northeast quarter of section 24, T.  13 S., R. 8 E. (Latitude 44 degrees, 26 minutes N, Longitude 121 degrees, 44 minutes W)

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil moisture control section is usually moist but is dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days in the 4 months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  All fragments are gravel size cinders.   The upper part of the particle-size control section (A and 2C) averages over 50 percent cinders and the lower part averages less than 10 percent cinders.

The Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick, except where disturbed.

The A horizon has hue of 10YR and value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It contains 35 to 50 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.

The 2C horizon has hue of 10YR with value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 6 moist and dry.  It contains 60 to 90 percent scoriaceous gravel.

The 3C and 4C horizon has hue of 10YR with value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy fine sand or ashy sandy loam.  It contains 2 to 10 percent gravel.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Douthit, Goatrock, Joebaldy, and Longjohn Series.  All of these soils lack the cindery surface mantle.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Haynap soils are on glacial moraines at elevations of 3500 to 5200 feet.  The soils formed in ash and scoria.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 50 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Douthit and the Belrick, Bott, Linksterly, and Minkwell soils.  All of these lack the surface mantle of scoria cinders.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; very rapid over moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for timber production, wildlife habitat, recreation, and watershed.  Potential native vegetation is ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, snowberry, and fern.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  East slopes of the Cascades in central Oregon; MLRA 3.  The series is not extensive.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in the pedon are:

Umbric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to 15 inches (A1, A2 horizon).

Andic soil properties - the entire profile meets criteria for andic soil properties (2C).  Glass count is low but size fraction in which glass determined (VFS) is very minor in amount.

Particle-size control section -  2 to 42 inches; averages 42 percent by volume cinders and 15-bar water content (dried) is less than 12 percent.   The family placement (ashy-skeletal) is based on a weighted average.

The soil has developed in "Blue Lake" and "Sand Mountain" tepHra (3,440 years old).

The upper part from 2 to 31 inches is glassy and from 29 to 40 inches is amorphic.

ADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for this pedon.  Reference sample S87OR-031-002 from Jefferson County, Oregon, NSSL, 87P 2709 - 2717.
