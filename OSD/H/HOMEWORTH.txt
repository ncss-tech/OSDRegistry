HOMEWORTH SERIES

The Homeworth series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in Wisconsinan age loamy water sorted material and the underlying finer textured lacustrine material on outwash plains and terraces.

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carway and Grantfork series. Carway soils have a higher mean annual air temperature. Grantfork soils have 10 percent or more saturation with sodium in the argillic horizon. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Homeworth soils formed in Wisconsinan age loamy water sorted material 30 to 50 inches thick and in the underlying finer textured lacustrine material and are on outwash plains and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Canfield, Ravenna, Rittman, Zepernick (T), Wadsworth and Wick soils. The moderately well drained Canfield and Rittman soils are on interfluves and side slopes of dissected till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Ravenna and Wadsworth soils are on convex flats and low interfluves, side slopes and base slopes on dissected till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Zepernick (T) and very poorly drained Wick soils are on floodplains. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is medium to negligible. Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy material and slow or very slow in the underlying finer textured material. In undisturbed areas the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 feet from December to May in normal years. 

USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are used to grow corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, and mixed hay. Natural vegetation is mixed hardwood forest composed primarily of sugar maple, oak and hickory. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: In northeastern Ohio. MLRA 139. The series are of small extent, about 1100 acres.

SERIES ESTABLISHED: Columbiana County, Ohio, 2005. 

REMARKS: Homeworth soils were formerly correlated in the Mahoning River valley, Ohio as Jimtown and Damascus with lacustrine materials and as Fitchville and Sebring map units. 

Diagnostic features in this pedon include: 
1. Ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 20 inches (Ap, Eg, and BE).
2. Argillic horizon - from a depth of 20 to 62 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, 2Bt5, 2BC).
3. Aquic conditions - from a depth of 13 to 80 inches. 

ADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon CO-149 for characterization data on the typical pedon, sample numbers 27151-27163, from Columbiana County, Ohio; samples analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.
