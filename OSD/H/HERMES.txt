HERMES SERIES

The Hermes series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in gypsiferous lacustrine sediments. These nearly level soils are on relict lakebeds on basin floors. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES: This is the Nasa series.  Nasa soils have more than 8 percent clay in the control section.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hermes soils are on relict lakebeds on basin floors.  These soils formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits.  Slope is 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.P  recipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The driest months are March and April. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.  Elevation ranges from 3,920 to 4,000 feet.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Basso, Copia, Elizario, Jato, Loki, Mcnew, Talos and Peligro soils.  Basso and Talos soils have argillic horizons and calcic horizons.
Copia soils are sandy and are on coppice dunes.  Elizario and Mcnew soils have calcic horizons and are on slightly depressed and slightly higher positions respectively of the alluvial flat of the basin floor.  Jato and Loki soils have calcic horizons above the gypsic horizon.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained. Permeability is moderate. Runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.

USE AND VEGETATION: Used for military exercises and weapons testing. Vegetation is of the desert shrub type and consists of gyp dropseed, hairy crinklemat, Torreys joint fir, gyp monopod, 4 wing saltbush, mesquite, and gyp scorpionweed.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Trans-Pecos of Texas and southern New Mexico; LRR D, MLRA 42; small extent.

REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:

Particle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches. (By1, By2, and Cy1, and Cy2 horizons)

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (An horizon) 

Gypsic horizon - the zone from 3 to 23 inches (Bnyy horizons)

Hermes: Hermes was the Greek god of shepherds. In the early 1950s, Hermes was tested at White Sands Missile Range as a surface to surface ballistic missile that later became the Redstone missile.
