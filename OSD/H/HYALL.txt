HYALL SERIES

The Hyall series consists of moderately deep to consolidated old alluvium (densic material), well drained soils formed
in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on side slopes of
terraces and have slopes of 12 to 60 percent.  The mean
annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual
air temperature is about 48 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Torrertic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hyall very gravelly clay loam - on a 47
percent convex west-facing slope on rangeland.  When
described, the soil was moist throughout.  (Colors are for
dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

	A--0 to 3 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly
clay loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist;
moderate fine and medium granular structure; slightly hard,
firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine
and fine roots; common very fine and fine continuous tubular
pores; about 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles;
neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches
thick)

	BA--3 to 8 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly
clay, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate
medium and fine subangular blocky structure; hard, firm,
moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine and few fine continuous tubular pores; about 35 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 12 inches thick)

	Bt1--8 to 14 inches; dark brown (10YR 3/3) very gravelly clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong medium subangular blocky structure; very hard, very firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common very fine continuous interstitial pores; many thin clay films on face of peds; about 40 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.0); clear smooth boundary.  (4 to 14 inches thick)

	Bt2--14 to 26 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4)
extremely gravelly clay, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong
medium angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; few very fine continuous interstitial pores; many moderately thick clay films on face of peds; about 55 percent gravel and 15 percent cobbles; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 16 inches
thick)

	2Cd--26 to 60 inches; multicolored extremely gravelly
loamy sand; strongly consolidated; about 60 percent gravel
and 15 percent cobbles; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

TYPE LOCATION:  Baker County, Oregon; about 3 miles
northwest of Richland; 300 feet downslope from terrace top;
1,300 feet north and 700 feet east of the southwest corner
of sec. 9, T. 9 S., R. 45 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth
to the 2Cd horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon
is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature
is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts
between depths of 4 to 12 inches for over half the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature is above
41 degrees F and are continuously dry for more than 3 months following the summer solstice.  The COLE value for the solum ranges from 5.0 to 8.0 cm with most pedons being over 6.0 cm given the range of thickness of the solum.

The A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 50 percent
gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.

The Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry or moist and chroma
of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is very gravelly clay or extremely gravelly clay with 25 to 60 percent gravel and 10
to 15 percent cobbles.  The clay percentage is 40 to 60
percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline and may contain a few segregated lime coatings.

The 2Cd horizon (densic material) is composed mainly of strongly consolidated extremely gravelly and cobbly old alluvium; with 50 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  The fine earth fraction ranges from clay loam to loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Moist bulk density is 1.60 to 1.70 grams per cubic centimeter.

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hyall soils are on side slopes of
dissected terraces at elevations of 2,700 to 3,500 feet.
Slopes are 12 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in mixed
alluvium.  This soil is found predominantly on south and
west aspects.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14
inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.
The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barnard,
Ruckles, Hibbard, Simas and the competing Ruclick series.
Barnard soils have a duripan and are on adjacent lower
terraces.  Ruckles soils are shallow and are on adjacent
basalt hills.  Hibbard soils are non-skeletal, have a
duripan and are on the top of the terraces.  Simas soils are
on hillslopes but are non-skeletal.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained.  Runoff is medium
to rapid.  Permeability is slow thru the subsoil and 2Cd material.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used for range,
watershed and wildlife habitat.  Native vegetation is
bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue and arrowleaf balsamroot.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern Oregon.  The series
is of small extent.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Portland, Oregon

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Baker County Area, Oregon, 1988.

REMARKS:  This soils is on the meta-stable and active slopes
of the Eola geomorphic surface.  Diagnostic horizons and other features:

- Mollic epipedon - 0 to 14 inches
- Argillic horizon - 3 to 26 inches
- Densic layer at 26 inches
- Torrertic subgroup - COLE from 0 to 26 inches is 5.6 cm 
                       assume most of series is over 6.0 cm.
