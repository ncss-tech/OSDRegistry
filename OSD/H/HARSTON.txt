HARSTON SERIES



The Harston series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in

moderately coarse textured alluvium.  Harston soils are on alluvial

fans and low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The mean

annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature

is about 45 degrees F.



TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, frigid Xeric Torrifluvents

Torrifluvents.



TYPICAL PEDON:  Harston fine sandy loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for

dry soil unless otherwise noted.)



    A1--0 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sandy loam,

dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure;

soft, very friable; many very fine and fine roots; mildly alkaline (pH

7.4); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 11 inches thick)



    C1--10 to 20 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, dark

brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, very friable; common very fine and many fine roots;

moderately calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth

boundary.  (10 to 30 inches thick)



    C2--20 to 25 inches; light gray (10YR 7/2) fine sandy loam, brown

(10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure;

slightly hard, very friable; common very fine and fine roots;

moderately calcareous; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear smooth

boundary.  (0 to 10 inches thick)



    IIC3--25 to 60 inches; very gravelly coarse sand; lime coatings on

lower surface of pebbles; mildly alkaline (pH 7.6).



TYPE LOCATION:  Bonneville County, Idaho; 2,560 feet west and 150 feet

south of the NE corner of sec. 35, T.2 N., R. 36 E.



RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 41

degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at depth of

20 inches is 59 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The 10- to 40-inch control

section averages moderately coarse texture and has less than 18 percent

clay (mostly less than 12) and less than 35 percent rock fragments.

Below a depth of 10 inches and to a depth of 25 inches or more, the

dominant texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or

gravelly sandy loam containing more than 50 percent fine sand or

coarser.  A layer of loose sand and gravel or very gravelly loamy sand

has its upper boundary between depths of 24 and 40 inches.  The organic

matter content decreases irregularly with increasing depth and reaches

levels 0.2 to 0.35 percent within a depth of 50 inches.  Reaction is

mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.



The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3

through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is too thin or has too little

organic matter to be a mollic epipedon.



The C horizon has color like the A horizon and also includes higher

value and chroma.



COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Hayeston series.  Hayeston soils have a

regular decrease in organic matter with increasing depth.



GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harston soils are on bottomlands, alluvial fans,

and low terraces at elevations of 4,200 to 6,100 feet.  Slopes are

dominantly less than 2 percent and range from 0 to 4 percent.  The

soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium over stream

deposited gravel and sand and lake shore sediments.  The alluvium is

dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources with lesser

influence from rhyolite, basaltic, and granitic materials.  The climate

is semiarid with dry summers and has a mean annual precipitation of 8

to 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees to 45

degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 126 days.



GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bannock, Blackfoot,

Heiseton and Wardboro soils.  Bannock and Blackfoot soils have a mollic

epipedon.  Heiseton soils have fluctuating water table at depths of 4

to 6 feet.  Wardboro soils have loose sand and gravel within 20 inches

of the surface.



DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well-drained; medium runoff; moderately

rapid permeability in the C1 horizon and very rapid in the sand and

gravel.  These soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding.



USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly cultivated under irrigation for hay,

pasture, potatoes, and small grains.  The natural vegetation is mainly

big sagebrush, cheatgrass, rabbitbrush, needleandthread, streambank

wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, Great Basin wildrye and Nevada bluegrass.



DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  The series is moderately extensive in the

bottomlands and low terraces of the upper Snake River Valley and the

tributary valleys in eastern Idaho.

REMARKS:  Soils correlated as Hayeston in Bingham Area and Jefferson

County, Idaho are Xeric Torrifluvents and are now included in the

Harston series.
