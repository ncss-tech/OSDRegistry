HINTERLAND SERIES

The Hinterland series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from hard sandstone.  These soils are on bedrock-floored sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Clayey, smectitic, frigid Aridic Lithic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hinterland clay loam, in rangeland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 3 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary. (2 to 7 inches thick)

    Bt1--3 to 6 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many fine and very fine pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)

    Bt2--6 to 12 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) channery clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate fine subangular blocky; hard, firm, sticky and plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine pores; many distinct clay films of faces of peds; 20 percent sandstone channers; neutral (pH 6.6); clear smooth boundary. (3 to 10 inches thick)

    R--12 inches; hard fractured sandstone with thin clay skins on surface of rock fragments in the upper 6 inches.

TYPE LOCATION:  Musselshell County, Montana; 200 feet north and 2,600 feet west of the SE corner of sec. 32, T. 11 N., R. 25 E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - bedrock-floored sedimentary plains and hills.

Elevation - 2,200 to 5,200 feet.

Slopes - 0 to 35 percent.

Parent material - residuum or colluvium derived from hard sandstone.

Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm summers.

Mean annual precipitation - 10 to 14 inches.

Mean annual air temperature - 39 to 45 degrees F.

Frost-free period - 95 to 135 days.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hinterland soils are used mainly for rangeland.  Potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, green needlegrass, and western wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hinterland soils are moderately extensive in central Montana.

MLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Denver, Colorado

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Musselshell County, Montana, 1996.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretation record:  MT1462.

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - after mixing the top 7 inches (A, part of Bt horizon); argillic horizon - from 3 to 12 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); particle-size control section - from the surface to 12 inches (A, Bt1, Bt2 horizons); lithic contact - at a depth of 12 inches (R horizon).  Hinterland soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.
