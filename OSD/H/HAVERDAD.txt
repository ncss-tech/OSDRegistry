HAVERDAD SERIES

The Haverdad series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium on flood plains and low terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Ustic Torrifluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Haverdad loam - utilized as rangeland. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated) 

    A--0 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate medium subangular structure parting to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots throughout; carbonates are disseminated throughout; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); gradual smooth boundary.  (2 to 8 inches thick) 

    C1--4 to 14 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common fine roots throughout; carbonates are disseminated throughout; slightly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear smooth boundary.

    C2--14 to 30 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) loam, stratified with fine sandy loam, sand loam, clay loam, and silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots throughout; carbonates are disseminated throughout; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.

    C3--30 to 60 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam, stratified with fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and very fine roots throughout; carbonates are disseminated throughout; slightly effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual smooth boundary.

TYPE LOCATION:  Niobrara County, Wyoming; about 2,600 feet north and 750 feet east of the southwest corner of Sec. 12, T 38 N, R 65 W.  lat. 43 degrees 17 minutes 2 seconds north and long. 104 degrees 36 minutes 54 seconds west.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture: The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more.  This soil is moist for 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.

Mean annual soil temperature:  48 to 53 degrees F. and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 195 days.

Organic carbon content:  .5 to 1.0 percent and decreases irregularly with depth
Rock fragments:  0 to 15 percent gravel
EC (mmhos/cm):  0 to 8 mmhos throughout but where irrigated some soils may range up to 16 mmhos
Calcium sulfate occurs in some pedons.
The soil is typically calcareous to the surface, but some pedons are leached as deep as 20 inches. 

A horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture:  loam, clay loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam
Reaction:  slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline

Some pedons have an AC horizon.

C horizon:
Hue:  10YR or 2.5Y
Value:  5 through 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist
Chroma:  2 through 4 dry or moist
Texture:  variable but when averaged is loam or light clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay
Calcium carbonate equivalent:  1 to 15 percent which changes erratically between strata
Reaction:  slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hamburn, Manikan, San Mateo, and Suwanee series. 

Hamburn: have pedogenic accumulations of salt and SARs greater than 13
Manikan, and Suwanee:  have hue of 7.5YR or redder
San Mateo:  have soil moisture control sections that are drier during April, May, and June

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Parent material:  alluvium from mixed sources
Landform: floodplains and low terraces
Elevations:  3,500 to 6,500 feet
Slopes:  0 to 6 percent
Mean annual precipitation:  about 11 inches, ranging 10 to 17,  with over half of annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June
Mean annual temperature:  about 45 degrees F. and ranges from 43 to 52 degrees F.
Frost-free period:  105 to 130 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arvada, Forkwood, Kishona, and Shingle soils.  Arvada soils have a natric horizon.  Forkwood soils have an argillic horizon.  Kishona soils lack stratification.  Shingle soils have bedrock at a depth of 4 to 20 inches.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.  Flooding for brief periods occurs during spring runoff and after thunder showers.

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used principally for grazing.  Principal native vegetation is big sagebrush, western wheatgrass, greasewood, and annual grasses and forbs.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Big Horn Basin, central, eastern Wyoming,  Colorado, and Utah.
