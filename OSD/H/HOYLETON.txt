COMPETING SERIES:

Sunbury soils have carbonates within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: 
Hoyleton soils are on ground moraines on till plains of Illinoian age. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. These soils formed in 76 to 140 centimeters (30 to 55 inches) of loess and the underlying pedisediment. The loess is late Wisconsin age Peoria Loess and underlying material is early Wisconsin age pedisediment or Roxana Silt which overlie a strongly developed Sangamon age paleosol in Illinoian till at depths of about 152 to 213 centimeters (5 to 7 feet). 

Mean annual temperature--12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F) 
Mean annual precipitation--838 to 1118 millimeters (36 to 44 inches)
Frost-free period--175 to 195 days
Elevation--122 to 213 meters (400 to 700 feet) above mean sea level 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 
Bluford soils have fragic soil properties and a lighter colored surface layer, and are on similar positions nearby or on narrower interfluves that are closer to dissected parts of the till plain. 
Cisne and Huey soils are poorly drained and are on lower positions nearby. Also, Huey soils have a natric horizon.
Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon and are on similar positions nearby or are mixed in an intricate pattern with Hoyleton soils on similar positions. 
Richview soils are moderately well drained and are on higher or more sloping positions on the till plain. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: 
Drainage class--somewhat poorly drained
Water table--depth to the top of an apparent water table ranges from 30 to 61 centimeters (1 to 2 feet) between January and May in normal years
Saturated hydraulic conductivity class--moderately high
Permeability class--moderately slow 

USE AND VEGETATION: 
Most areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, small grain, or meadow. Native vegetation is prairie grasses and widely spaced trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: 
MLRAs 113 and 114 in southern Illinois. The series is extensive.
