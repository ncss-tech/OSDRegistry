HOYLETON SERIES

The Hoyleton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on uplands. These soils formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits which overlie a strongly weathered Sangamon age paleosol in the Illinoian age till. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Sedalia and Sunbury series. Sedalia soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Sunbury soils have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoyleton soils are on low convex ridges of Illinoian till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. These soils formed in 76 to 140 cm (30 to 55 inches) of loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits. The loess is late Wisconsinan Peoria silts, and the underlying silty or loamy deposits are early Wisconsinan Roxana silts. Hoyleton soils are commonly underlain at depths of about 152 to 213 cm (5 to 7 feet) by a strongly weathered Sangamon age paleosol in Illinoian age till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F). Elevation is 122 to 213 meters (400 to 700 feet) above mean sea level. 

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluford, Cisne, Darmstadt, Huey, and Richview soils. Bluford soils have fragic soil properties, have a lighter colored surface layer, and are on similar nearby low convex ridges or on more nearly level parts of the till plain. Cisne and Huey soils are poorly drained and are on more nearly level or lower lying parts of the till plain. Also, Huey soils have a natric horizon. Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon; they are in an intricate pattern with Hoyleton soils on some broad convex ridges. Richview soils are better drained and are on higher or more sloping ridges. 

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow. 
USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, small grain, or meadow. Native vegetation is prairie grasses and widely spaced trees. 

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: MLRAs 113 and 114B in southern Illinois. The series is extensive.
