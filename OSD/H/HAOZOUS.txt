HAOZOUS SERIES

The Haozous series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Haozous soils are on inset fans of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crucitas, Janude, Kaskan, Lamesilla, Paymaster, and Payter series.
Janude, Payter, and Paymaster soils average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and do not have significant amounts of medium to very coarse angular granitic sands.
Janude and Kaskan soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.
Cricitas, Lamesilla, Paymaster, and Payter soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Haozous soils are on inset fans of erosional fan remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chupe, Golondrina, Paraje, and Vitrina soils.  Chupe soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains of valley floors.  Golondrina soils are loamy-skeletal, have thin mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on backslopes and footslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Paraje soils are loamy-skeletal, have argillic and calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders of erosional fan remnants.  Vitrina soils are coarse-loamy, have thin mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; low surface runoff; permeability is moderately rapid.  Haozous soils are subject to frequent, extremely brief periods of flooding between July and September.  Floodwaters have low velocity and are generally less than 1 foot deep.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Haozous soils are used for urban development, livestock grazing, and recreation.  The historic climax vegetation is blue grama, black  grama, galleta, oak, and oneseed juniper.  The ecological site is Hills(R036XB124NM).

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Haozous soils are of small extent on the southeastern Espanola Basin part of the Basin and Range province in northcentral New Mexico.  The MLRA is 36.
