   2Cgb--70 to 80 inches (178 to 205 centimeters); olive gray (5Y 4/2) loam; massive; moderately fluid; 10 percent brown 7.5YR4/4 wood fragments; slightly alkaline; slightly saline; (0 to 24 inches (0 to 60 centimeters) thick)

TYPE LOCATION: Sussex County, Delaware; approximately 600 feet northeast of Green Landing in Herring Creek; latitude 38 degrees, 39 minutes, 24 seconds N and longitude 75degrees, 09 minutes, 37 seconds W.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Depth to Bedrock: Greater than 80 inches (200 centimeters)
Depth to Lithologic Discontinuity: Less than 80 inches (200 centimeters)
Shell Fragments: 0 to 5 percent, by volume
Soil Reaction: Slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline throughout the profile; 
Oxidized Reaction:  Ultra acid
Electrical Conductivity: Greater than 16 mmhos/cm in the upper solum and 6 to 16 mmhos/cm in the substratum
Salinity Class: Slightly to strongly saline
Other Features: Depth to the buried organic horizon is 8 to 40 inches (20 to 100 centimeters)

Range of Individual Horizons:
Ase horizon:
Color--hue of 10YR to 10Y, value of 2.5 to 4, and chroma of 0 or 2
Texture-silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam or their mucky analogs

Cseg horizon:
Color--hue of 5Y to 10B, value of 2.5 to 4, and chroma of 0 or 2, 
Texture-- silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam or their mucky analogs 

Oeseb, Oaseb horizon:
Color--hue if 10YR to 5Y, value of 2.5 to 3, and chroma of 0 or 2,
Texture--muck or mucky peat

2Cgb horizon:
Color--hue of 2.5Y to 10B, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 or 2, 
Texture-- sandy loam, loam, silty clay, silty clay loam or silt loam

COMPETING SERIES: The Southpoint series is the only competing soil. Southpoint soils are strongly saline throughout the profile and do not have wood fragments in the solum and substratum. Herring Creek soils have wood fragments in the lower solum and substratum.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:
Landscape: Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain Estuaries
Landform: Estuarine tidal Creeks
Parent Material: Silty terrestrial tidal marsh sediments overlying organic deposits
Slope: 0 to 1 percent
Mean Annual Air Temperature: 50 to 57 degrees F. (10 to 14 degrees C.)
Mean Annual Water Temperature: 52 to 58 degrees F. (11 to 14 degrees C.)
Bathymetry: 0 to 3 meters below Mean Sea Level Water Regime: Tidal, 0.25 to 2 meters tidal range

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:
Broadkill soils--do not have buried organic layers within 40 inches (1 meter) and are not permanently submerged; on adjacent tidal marshes
Mispillion soils--are not permanently submerged; on adjacent tidal marshes
Tingles soils (tentative)--do not have buried organic layers within 40 inches (1 meter)
Transquaking soils--are not permanently submerged and have organic surface layers more than 20 inches (51 centimeters) thick; on adjacent tidal marshes

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:
Agricultural Drainage Class: Subaqueous (permanently submersed)
Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity:  Moderately low or low
Permeability (obsolete): Moderately slow or slow

USE AND VEGETATION:
Major Uses: Most areas are un-vegetated and function as estuarine benthic habitat. Benthic fauna such as tubeworms, clams, juvenile blue crabs, scallops and juvenile finfish use these areas.

Dominant Vegetation: Native vegetation includes rooted algae, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima). Vegetative cover ranges from 0 to 5 
percent.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: The Mid-Atlantic coastal estuaries of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and possibly Virginia. This series is of small extent.
