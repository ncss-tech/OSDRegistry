HYALITE SERIES

The Hyalite series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Argiustolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hyalite loam in cropland (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise indicated).

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; permeability is moderately slow in the argillic horizon and rapid in the 3C horizon.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hyalite soils are used mainly for irrigated and nonirrigated cropland, and pasture.  The potential native vegetation is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, rough fescue, Columbia needlegrass, and Richardson needlegrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hyalite soils are of small extent in southwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Gallatin County, Montana, 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil interpretations records:  MT1341, MT1342.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:  a mollic epipedon from the surface to 8 inches (A, Bt1 horizons); an argillic horizon that is the particle size control section from 5 to 17 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons); and skeletal material from 17 to 60 inches (2Bt3, 3C horizon).  Hyalite soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.
