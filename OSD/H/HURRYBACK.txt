HURRYBACK SERIES

The Hurryback series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in slope alluvium and loess from volcanoclastic material.  Hurryback soils are on foothills, terrace and tableland escarpments, and landslide deposits.  Slopes range from 8 to 40 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 380 mm and average annual temperature is 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Pachic Argixerolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hurryback loam -- on a north-facing slope of 35 percent in native rangeland, at 1,465 meter elevation.  (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.  When described on October 23, 1984, the soil was moist to 10 cm and slightly moist below.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium and fine granular structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, fine, and medium roots; common very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.4); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 36 cm thick)

    BA--15 to 61 cm; brown (10YR 4/3) clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and  moderately plastic; common very fine, fine and medium roots; common very fine tubular pores; common faint clay films on faces of peds; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.   (13 to 46 cm thick)

    Bt1--61 to 89 cm; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) gravelly clay loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine and fine roots; common fine and very fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 15 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.7); clear wavy boundary.   (20 to 71 cm thick)

    Bt2--89 to 152 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine, few fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bly, Carey Lake, Dunford, Hades, Krueger, Lagnaf, Mahogan, Marotz, Moffspring, Nagle, Sag, Strom, and Tusk series.  Bly soils have average summer soil temperature cooler than 17 degrees C.  Carey Lake soils have BC and 2C horizons with mottles.  Dunford and Mahogan soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Hades soils have average annual soil temperatures of 4 to 6 degrees C. Krueger soils are mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon.  Lagnaf soils have more than 20 percent gravel in the upper 50 cm of the argillic.  Marotz soils have buried argillic horizons formed in contrasting material and average summer soil temperature less than 17 degrees C.  Nagle soils are calcareous above 100 cm.  Moffspring soils have argillic horizons 13 to 25 cm thick.  Sag soils have 40 to 60 percent clay and 50 to 90 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon (discontinuity). Strom soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Tusk soils are neutral to mildly alkaline and the lower argillic has 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hurryback soils are on strongly sloping to steep foothill sideslopes, terrace and tableland escarpments, and landslide deposits at elevations of 1,405 to 1,925 meters.  Slopes range from 8 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and loess from volcanoclastic material.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 330 to 410 mm, and average annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 65 to 95 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Avtable, Bieber, Hat, Longcreek, and Wickahoney series.  Avtable, Longcreek, and Wickahoney soils are less than 50 cm to bedrock.   Bieber soils have a duripan.  Hat soils lack a mollic epipedon and have greater than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  These soils are on summits or exposed sideslopes.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff; moderately slow saturated hydraulic conductivity. 

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hurryback soils are used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The dominant natural vegetation is mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, Idaho fescue, and bluebunch wheatgrass.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Southwestern Idaho.  Hurryback soils are of small extent. MLRA 25.
