HAWLEY SERIES

The Hawley series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on high flood plains subject to rare flooding, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 838 mm (33 in), and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (63 degrees F)

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Fluventic Haplustepts

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hawley fine sandy loam, on a 0 to 3 percent slope in native grasses at an elevation of 334 m (1095 ft). (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)

     Ap--0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable; moderately acid; clear smooth boundary. 

     A--23 to 46 cm (9 to 18 in); brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure breaking to weak fine granular; slightly hard, friable; neutral; gradual smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 18 to 75 cm [7 to 29 in])

     Bw--46 to 86 cm (18 to 34 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak coarse prismatic structure; soft, very friable; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the Bw horizon is 18 to 102 cm [7 to 40 in])

     C1--86 to 127 cm (34 to 50 in); brown (7.5YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable; strata 6 to 10 cm (0.25 inch to 4 in) thick of loamy fine sand and very fine sandy loam; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary. (Thickness of the C1 horizon is 28 to 81 cm [11 to 32 in])

     C2--127 to 168 cm (50 to 66 in); brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable; strata 6 to 10 cm (0.25 in to 4 in) thick of very fine sandy loam, silt loam, and silty clay loam, few soft powdery masses and threads of calcium carbonate; calcareous; moderately alkaline.
