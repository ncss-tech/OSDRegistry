HASHWOODS SERIES

The Hashwoods series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from andesite over residuum weathered from tuff or tuff-breccia.  Hashwoods soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Ashy, glassy Vitrandic Argicryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hashwoods ashy fine sandy loam--aspen forest land.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 13 cm; dark brown (10YR 3/3) crushed, ashy fine sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) crushed, moist; weak very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine to very coarse roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent fine gravel and 5 percent medium and coarse gravel; neutral, (pH 6.8); abrupt wavy boundary.  (10 to 18 cm thick)

    A2--13 to 38 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) crushed, ashy fine sandy loam, black (10YR 2/1) crushed, moist; moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine to very coarse roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent fine gravel and 5 percent medium and coarse gravel; neutral, (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (20 to 30 cm thick)

    A3--38 to 79 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) crushed, very cobbly ashy fine sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) crushed, moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine to very coarse roots throughout; many very fine interstitial pores; 5 percent fine gravel, 15 percent medium and coarse gravel, 15 percent cobbles, and 10 percent stones; neutral, (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (30 to 46 cm thick)

    2Bt--79 to 122 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) crushed, very paragravelly ashy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) crushed, moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine and medium roots throughout; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 2 percent faint clay films lining pores and 20 percent faint clay bridges between sand grains; 5 percent fine tuff paragravel, 25 percent medium and coarse tuff paragravel, 5 percent andesite cobbles and 10 percent stones; slightly acid, (pH 6.4); clear wavy boundary.  (38 to 64 cm thick)

    2Cr--122 to 147 cm; soft vitric andesitic tuff.

TYPE LOCATION:  Washoe County, Nevada; in the Hays Canyon Range; about 1.5 miles south of Devine Spring; in nonsectionized township T. 39 N., R. 19 E.; USGS Boulder Mountain 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle; 41 degrees 18 minutes 30.4 seconds north latitude and 119 degrees 51 minutes 19.7 seconds west longitude; WGS84 Decimal Degrees 41.3089444 latitude, -119.8554722 longitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Soil moisture - Moist in winter and spring, dry in late summer and fall; completely dry for at least 45 consecutive days between July and October; Xeric moisture regime that borders on aridic.

Mean annual soil temperature - 6.7 to 8.3 degrees C.
Mean summer soil temperature - 12.2 to 15.0 degrees C.
Mollic epipedon thickness - 76 to 89 cm.
Depth to bedrock - 100 to 152 cm to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are vitric pyroclastic tuff.
Volcanic glass content - 50 to 80 percent in the coarse silt through fine sand fractions.
Particle-size control section - Clay content: 12 to 18 percent;
Rock fragments: 5 to 15 percent;
Pararock fragments: 30 to 40 percent paragravel.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks.

A horizon
Value: 3 or 4 dry.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry, 1 or 2 moist.
Reaction: Slightly acid or neutral.

2Bt horizon
Value: 5 or 6 dry.
Chroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.
Structure: Angular blocky or subangular blocky.
Consistence: Slightly hard or hard dry.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Atastra, Nissler and Oldgrade series.

Atastra soils are very deep, have extremely cobbly texture below 60 cm, and have Mollic epipedons more than 90 cm thick.  Nissler soils are very deep and have an ustic moisture regime.  Oldgrade soils are very deep and have Mollic epipedons less than  50 cm thick.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hashwoods soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on north-facing middle to upper, concave backslope positions.  They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from andesite over residuum weathered from tuff or tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,660 to 2,445 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.  These soils receive additional moisture from adjacent areas.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brownsbowl and Hutchley soils.  Brownsbowl soils are very deep and do not have argillic horizons.  Hutchley soils are shallow to lithic contacts.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderately rapid saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hashwoods soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of quaking aspen with a sparse understory of mountain brome, snowberry, and chokecherry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Nevada and northeastern California.  These soils are not extensive with about 1,500 acres of the series mapped to date.  MLRA 23.
