HORSEPLAINS SERIES

The Horseplains series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Sandy, mixed, frigid Typic Xerofluvents

TYPICAL PEDON:  Horseplains fine sandy loam, forested (colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted).

    A--0 to 4 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine and medium, common coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (3 to 6 inches thick)

    C1--4 to 10 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) fine sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  ( 5 to 8 inches thick)

    C2--10 to 35 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified, loamy fine sand and fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine, common medium, and few coarse roots; neutral (pH 6.8); clear smooth boundary.  (15 to 30 inches thick)

    C3--35 to 39 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) very fine sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); clear smooth boundary.  (0 to 5 inches thick)

    C4--39 to 60 inches: pale brown (10YR 6/3) stratified, loamy fine sand and fine sand, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; single grain; loose; common fine and medium, few coarse roots; neutral (pH 7.2).

COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:

Landform - flood plains.
Elevation - 2,400 to 2,900 feet.
Slope - 0 to 2 percent.
Parent material - sandy alluvium.
Climate - long, cold winters; moist springs; warm, dry summers.
Mean annual precipitation - 15 to 19 inches, much of which falls as snow and spring rains.
Mean annual temperature - 42 to 45 degrees F.
Frost-free period - 85 to 115 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained; moderately rapid or rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Horseplains soils are used mainly for understory grazing and wildlife habitat.  They have potential as irrigated cropland.  Potential native vegetation is slender wheatgrass, black cottonwood, shrubs and other perennial grasses.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Horseplains soils are of limited extent along the Flathead and Clark Fork River drainages in northwestern Montana.

SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Sanders County, Montana 1997.

REMARKS:  Soil Interpretation Record:  MT1062.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches (A and C1 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches, (C2, C3, and C4 horizons).  Horseplains soils have a frigid temperature regime and an xeric moisture regime.
