HOLLYHILLS SERIES

The Hollyhills series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Hollyhills soils are on eroded summits and side slopes of fan remnants. Slope ranges from 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Sodic Haplogypsids

TYPICAL PEDON:  On Hollyhills-Spider association, 2 to 30 percent slopes at an elevation of 2,600 feet.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The surface is covered by approximately 58 percent gravel, 30 percent cobbles, and 2 percent stones.

COMPETING SERIES: At this time there are no competing series.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hollyhills soils are on eroded summits of fan remnants. Slope ranges from 8 to 30 percent. The soils formed in material from mixed alluvium.  Elevations are 2,200 to 3,300 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Cajon, Coyote (T), Gravesumit (T), and Spider (T) soils. Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are found in inset fans. Cajon soils do not have durinodes and are found in inset fans. Coyote soils are on similar landscape positions but have a well developed calcic horizon in addition to durinodes. Gravesumit soils are found on adjacent fans and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section with a calcic and an argillic horizon.  Spider soils are on summits and side slopes of the same landscape, have a sandy particle-size control section and have a zone which is characterized by duric properties.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; very low to medium runoff; moderate or moderately rapid permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hollyhills soils are used for military exercises and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is mainly desert holly, creosotebush, California ephedra, and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Mojave Desert of southeastern California. MLRA 30. The series is of small extent.
