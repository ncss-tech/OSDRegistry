HYRHY SERIES

The Hyrhy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt.  Hyrhy soils are on basalt lava flows with slopes of 2 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS:  Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic Ustic Haplargids

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hyrhy cobbly loam - rangeland and wildlife habitat.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  The soil survace is partly covered by 10 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble and 1 percent stone.

(1 to 3 inches thick)

A2--1 to 3 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly silt loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky and strong very thin platy structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and few fine irregular pores; noneffervescent; 15 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble and 10 percent stone; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt wavy boundary.  (0 to 2 inches thick)

Bw--3 to 8 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly silt loam; dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4); moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine roots; common very fine irregular and few fine tubular pores; common red (2.5YR 4/6) stains on faces of peds; lower part has discontinuous (less than 10 percent), moderate medium subangular blocky peds, brown (7.5YR 5/4), silty clay loam with common thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; noneffervescent; 15 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble and 10 percent stone; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); clear wavy boundary.  (4 to 8 inches thick)

Btk--8 to 19 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very stony silty clay loam; dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) moist; moderate and strong medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine and fine and few medium and coarse tubular pores; common thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds and lining pores; common fine filaments and soft masses and few medium soft masses of calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; 10 percent gravel, 15 percent cobble and 20 percent stone; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 16 inches thick)

Bk--19 to 25 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very stony silty clay loam; brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; massive; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine and fine tubular pores; very few fine seams and soft masses of calcium carbonate; slightly effervescent; 25 percent gravel, 10 percent cobble and 10 percent stone; moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (5 to 12 inches thick)

R--25 inches; basalt bedrock.   

TYPE LOCATION:  Mojave County, Arizona; located about 950 feet south and 950 feet east of the northeast corner of Section 35, T. 33 N., R. 9 W.; 36 degrees 13 minutes 13 seconds north latitude and 113 degrees 13 minutes 45 seconds west longitude.

Soil moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 days cummulative, July through September.  Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.

Soil temperature:  59 to 64 degrees F.

Rock Fragments:  35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section dominated by cobbles and stones

Clay content:  averages 24 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alsco (AZ), Caralampi (AZ),  Coxwell (NM), Holliday (NM), Hopswell (NV), Maloy (AZ), Monza (NM) and Nolam (NM) series.  All of these soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock.  In addition, Holliday and Monza soils do not have calcium carbonates in the argillic horizon and the Coxranch soils are more than 40 inches deep to a petrocalcic.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hyrhy soils are on basalt lava flows.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent.  They formed in alluvium and residuum from basalt.  Elevations range from 3600 to 4500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost free period is 200 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barten soils.  Barten soils are less than 20 inches deep to basalt bedrock.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low runoff; moderately slow permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hyrhy soils are used for livestock grazing, recreation and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation includes big galleta, banana yucca, Anderson wolfberry, prickly pear, ephedra, broom snakeweek, red brome and creosotebush

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northern Arizona; MLRA is 30.  Hyrhy series are not extensive.
