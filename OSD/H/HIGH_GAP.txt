HIGH GAP SERIES

The High Gap series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy drift. A thin layer is developed in residuum from sandstone in some pedons. The High Gap soils are on bedrock terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: High Gap silt loam, on a west-facing, convex, 4 percent slope in a pasture at an elevation of about 158 meters (520 feet) above mean sea level. (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)

 Ap--0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches); brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; moderate medium granular structure; friable; many fine roots; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary. [15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) thick]

 Bt1--20 to 86 cm (8 to 34 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; common fine roots; few fine pores; thin discontinuous dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; few fine black (10YR 2/1) iron and manganese oxide concretions; 5 percent sandstone fragments; firm; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary. [38 to 76 cm (15 to 30 inches) thick]

 Bt2--86 to 96 cm (34 to 38 inches); yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) channery clay loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; firm; few fine roots; few fine pores; thin discontinuous dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay films on faces of peds; 25 percent sandstone fragments; strongly acid, abrupt smooth boundary. [8 to 25 cm (3 to 10 inches) thick]

 2R--96 cm (38 inches); strongly cemented sandstone.

TYPE LOCATION: Vermillion County, Indiana; about 2 miles north of Perryville; 900 feet north and 900 feet west of the southeast corner of sec. 15, T. 19 N., R. 9 W.; USGS Perrysville, Ind. topographic quadrangle; UTM Zone 16, 464700 easting and 4436985 northing, NAD 83.

Depth to lithic contact: 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches)
Particle-size control section: averages 24 to 30 percent clay

Ap horizon:
Hue: 10YR
Value: 4 or 5
Chroma: 2 or 3
Texture: dominantly silt loam or loam but ranges to clay loam in severely eroded pedons
Reaction: very strongly acid to neutral depending on liming history

A horizon, where present:
Hue: 10YR

Chroma: 1 to 3

Bt horizon formed in loess, where present:
Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR

Chroma: 4 to 6
Reaction: clay loam, loam, or channery clay loam
Rock fragment content: 0 to 25 percent

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amanda, Belmont, Belmore, Caprell, Chili, Cliftycreek, Conestoga, Crouse, Gallman, Greybrook, Hickory, Hollinger, Kanawha, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, Lumberton, Martinsville, Military, Mocksville, Ockley, Pignut, Princeton, Relay, Richardville, Riddles, Senachwine, Skelton, Strawn, Wawaka, Wawasee, and Woodbine series. All of these soils except Military and Pignut soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to bedrock. Military soils formed in sandy loam till overlying sandstone bedrock and are in areas where the mean annual precipitation is less than 914 mm (36 inches) and less than 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Pignut soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: High Gap soils are on bedrock terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy drift of Wisconsinan age. A thin layer is developed in residuum from sandstone in some pedons. Depth to hard sandstone ranges from 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches). Below the sandstone cap, the bedrock has layers of siltstone and shale in some places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 53 degrees F).

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fox, Gosport, Miami, and Shadeland soils. The Fox soils have sand and gravelly sand above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and are on nearby terraces. The Gosport soils formed in fine-textured shale residuum and are on steeper breaks. Miami soils formed in till and are on higher lying till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Shadeland soils are on slightly lower lying positions on bedrock terraces.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from very low to high depending on slope gradient. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum. Permeability is moderate in the solum.

USE AND VEGETATION: About half of the areas are cropped to corn, soybeans, small grain, and legume hay. The rest is used for pasture or woodland. Native vegetation is oak, hickory, and maple.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: West-central Indiana and Illinois; MLRAs 108A, 110, and 111D. The type location is in MLRA 108A. The series is of small extent.
