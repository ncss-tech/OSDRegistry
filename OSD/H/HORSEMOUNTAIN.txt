HORSEMOUNTAIN SERIES

The Horsemountain series consists of shallow over lime cemented hardpan, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Horsemountain soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Ustalfic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Horsemountain fine sandy loam, 2 to 15 percent slopes -- rangeland. (Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated).

Mean annual precipitation: 9 to 12 inches
Mean annual air temperature: 45 to 52 degrees F.
Frost-free period: 120 to 160 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abracon, Clapper and Paradox soils.  The Abracon soils are very deep and do not have argillic horizons.  The Clapper soils are loamy-skeletal and very deep.  The Paradox soils are very deep and do not have petrocalcic horizons. 

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; low runoff; moderately rapid permeability. 

USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for rangeland.  Potential vegetation consists of Utah Juniper, pinyon pine, Wyoming big sagebrush, bitterbrush, mountain mahogany, Indian ricegrass, galleta, bottlebrush squirreltail and needleandthread.  These soils have been correlated to the Semidesert Shallow Loam range site.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Southern Utah; MLRA 35. The series is of small extent.
