HAILMAN SERIES

The Hailman series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from intermediate igneous rocks.  Hailman soils are on ground and lateral moraines and have slopes of 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Hailman loam, rangeland - woodland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)

     Oi--0 to 3 cm; leaf litter.

     A1--3 to 16 cm; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loam very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak fine granular structure, loose, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many fine roots; moderately acid (pH 5.7); clear wavy boundary. 

     A2--16 to 41 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak medium granular; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium and few coarse roots; common fine pores; moderately acid (pH 5.8); clear wavy boundary. 

     A3--41 to 69 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) cobbly loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine and medium and few coarse roots; common fine pores; some pockets with thin continuous gray coatings on peds; 30 percent cobbles and gravel; moderately acid (pH 6.0); clear irregular boundary.  (Combined thickness of A horizons - 50 to 70 cm thick)

     AB--69 to 87 cm; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) cobbly loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; weak coarse and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, brittle, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common fine and medium roots; common fine pores; thin continuous gray coatings on peds; 30 percent cobbles and gravel; moderately acid (pH 5.7); abrupt wavy boundary.  (13 to 30 cm thick)

     Bw1--87 to 112 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; few gray coatings on some peds in upper part of this horizon; thin clay films in channels and voids; 30 percent cobbles and gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.   (25 to 30 cm thick)

     Bw2--112 to 148 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) cobbly loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few fine and medium roots; many very fine pores; thin clay films in channels and voids; 30 percent cobbles and gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.1); clear wavy boundary.   (25 to 36 cm thick)

     Cr--148 to 178 cm; weathered intermediate igneous rock.

TYPE LOCATION:  Wasatch County, Utah; about 14 km north of Midway Post Office on Pine Creek Road; SW1/4 section 33, T.25., R.4E.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature--4 degrees C
Mean summer soil temperature--15 degrees C or less
The soils are usually moist and are not dry for as much as 90 cumulative days in some subhorizons.  
Mollic epipedon thickness--64 to 100 cm
Organic matter decreases regularly with increasing depth.
A thin layer of leaves and twigs 3 to 5 cm thick is common on the surface.

Particle-size control section:
Clay content--less than 18 percent
Rock fragment content--20 to 35 percent gravel, cobbles and stones

A horizons
Value--3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist
Chroma--2 or 3

Bw horizons
Value--5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist
Chroma--3 or 4
Texture--cobbly light loam to cobbly loam
Structure--weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure
Some thin clay films occur mainly as bridging between peds and as coatings on the sand grains.

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dunager, Gardners Fork, Naz, Pargin, Shook, Sizemore and Skyway series.  Dunager and Skyway soils have bedrock at depths of less than 100 cm.  Gardners Fork, Naz, Pargin and Sizemore soils lack a Bw horizon.  Gardners Fork soils have a shaley sandy loam control section.  Naz and Sizemore soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments.  Pargin soils have mottles at depth of about 70 cm.  Shook soils have coarse sandy loam and sandy loam control sections.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  
Landform--ground and lateral moraines
Elevation--1975 to 2600 meters
Slope--3 to 30 percent
Parent material--coarse grained intermediate igneous parent rocks
Climate--humid
Mean annual precipitation--640 to 890 mm falling mostly as snow
Mean annual air temperature--4 degrees C
Mean summer air temperature--14 degrees C
Frost-free period--50 to 80 days

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  None listed

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; medium runoff; moderate permeability

USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for rangeland, wildlife habitat and as watershed.  Important native plants include an overstory of aspen and an understory of snowberry, elderberry, mountain bromegrass, blue wildrye, oniongrass, slender wheatgrass, peavine, horsemint, bluebells, columbine, geranium, anise and western valerian.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Hailman soils are moderately extensive in the high mountain areas of central and northern Utah, northern Colorado, and western Wyoming; MLRAs 34A, 43B, 47 and 48A
