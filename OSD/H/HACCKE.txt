HACCKE SERIES

The Haccke series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium and eolian deposits. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, and hills. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Inceptic Haplustalfs

TYPICAL PEDON: Haccke silt loam, in rangeland on a 6 percent slope at 1,420 meters elevation. (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 15 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong very thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many fine roots; many fine tubular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral (pH 7.2); abrupt smooth boundary. (8 to 20 cm thick)

    Bt--15 to 38 cm; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium columnar structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; common fine roots; common fine tubular pores; many distinct clay films on ped faces; 5 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); abrupt smooth boundary (15 to 31 cm thick)

    Bkn1--38 to 71 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/4) silt loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; common fine calcium carbonate masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 8.6); gradual wavy boundary. (10 to 66 cm thick)

    Bkn2--71 to 122 cm; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silt loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; common fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; many medium calcium carbonate  masses; violently effervescent; strongly alkaline (pH 9.0); gradual wavy boundary. (18 to 60 cm thick)

    C--122 to 152 cm; very pale brown (10YR 8/3) fine sandy loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; few fine roots; few fine irregular pores; 5 percent gravel; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2).

TYPE LOCATION: Corley Gulch topographic quadrangle, Ravalli County, Montana; 115 meters west and 530 meters north of the SE corner of sec. 15, T. 8 N., R. 19 W; UTM zone 12, 273477E, 5148078N, NAD 83.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:
Mean annual soil temperature - 5 to 8 degrees C
Depth to secondary calcium carbonate accumulation - 25 to 40 cm
Depth to sodium accumulation - 25 to 40 cm

This soil typically has the character of a natric horizon but the sodium has been transported deeper into the profile.

Some pedons have an E horizon in place of the A horizon.
