HOBCAN SERIES

The Hobcan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from sedimentary and igneous formations.  Hobcan soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Calcigypsids

TYPE LOCATION:  Mohave County, Arizona; 1000 feet south of the Arizona State Line and about 9 miles west of Hurricane Cliffs; 2600 feet north and 1800 feet east of the southwest corner of section 34, T.42 N., R.11 W.; 113 degrees, 28 minutes and 22 seconds west longitude and 36 degrees, 59 minutes and 52 seconds north latitude.

RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:

Soil Moisture:  Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July-September and December-February.  Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.

Rock Fragments:  less than 15 percent

Soil Temperature:  59 to 72 degrees F.

Organic Matter:  Less than .5 percent in the surface horizon

Depth to Calcic horizon:  1 to 4 inches

Depth to Gypsic horizon:  8 to 16 inches.  Percent gypsum x the thickness in centimeters is less than 3000.

Reaction: slightly or moderately alkaline


A horizon

Hue:  5YR, 7.5YR

Value:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist

Bk horizon

Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR

Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist

Bky horizon

Hue: 5YR, 7.5YR

Value: 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist

Chroma: 4 through 6, dry or moist

Texture: very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam (5 to 18 percent clay)

Calcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 25 percent

Gypsum: 5 to 20 percent, any one horizon may range to 30 percent

COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Monahans (TX) series.  Monahans soils are 16 to 36 inches to a gypsic horizon, are moist in the control section for considerably longer periods due to a much higher rainfall component and do not occur in the Mohave Desert.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hobcan soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  These soils are formed in mixed alluvium derived from sedimentary formations.  Elevations range from 1600 to 4500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gypill and Nikey soils.  Gypill soils are on eroding hills, average more than 40 percent gypsum, and are shallow to interbedded shale and gypsum.  Nikey soils are very deep calcareous soils on fan terraces and contain small amounts of gypsum.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained;  slow runoff;  moderate permeability.  Flooding is none to rare.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Hobcan soils are used for livestock grazing.  The present vegetation is big galleta, yucca, creosotebush, ratany and white bursage.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northwestern Arizona.  The series is of small extent.
