HAVASUPAI SERIES

The Havasupai series consists of shallow to hardpan, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in fan alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic, shallow Calcic Petrocalcids

TYPICAL PEDON: Havasupai very gravelly loam - rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A--0 to 2 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/2) very gravelly loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; many very fine irregular pores; 55 percent fine gravel as surface lag layer; strongly effervescent, 16 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)

    Bk1--2 to 7 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; 20 percent gravel and 5 percent cobble; few thin calcium carbonate coatings under rock fragments; strongly effervescent, 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear wavy boundary. (3 to 8 inches thick)

    Bk2--7 to 14 inches; light brown (7.5YR 6/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 5/4) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; hard, friable, nonsticky and slightly plastic; common very fine roots; few very fine tubular pores; 30 percent gravel and 10 percent cobble; common thin calcium carbonate coatings on rock fragments; violently effervescent, 45 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.5); abrupt wavy boundary. (5 to 9 inches thick)

    Bkm--14 to 33 inches; laminar capped, calcium carbonate cemented hardpan; abrupt wavy boundary. (6 to 24 inches thick)

    2Bk--33 to 60 inches; reddish brown (5YR 5/4) extremely gravelly sand, reddish brown (5YR 4/4) moist; massive; very hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; 80 percent gravel and 5 percent cobble; many thick calcium carbonate coatings and pendants on rock fragments; weak to strong discontinuous calcium carbonate cementation; violently effervescent; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4).

COMPETING SERIES: These are the Childers (AZ), Curhollow (UT), Pibler (UT), and Pinetown (UT) series. Childers and Curhollow soils have bedrock below the petrocalcic horizon. Pibler soils are usually moist in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall, and have an aridic soil moisture regime that borders on xeric. Pinetown soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Havasupai soils are on fan terraces at elevations of 4300 to 6000 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 135 to 175 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Barx, Cibeque, Curhollow, and Winona soils.  Barx and Cibeque soils are fine-loamy and very deep.  Winona soils are shallow to limestone.

DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; medium to high runoff; moderate permeability.

USE AND VEGETATION: Havasupai soils are used for livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  Vegetation is black grama, blue grama, needleandthread, banana yucca and Fremont barberry.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northern Arizona.  This soil is moderately extensive. MLRA is 35
