HOULA SERIES

The Houla series consists of very deep, well drained soils. These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in loamy, calcareous, tuffaceous sediments of the Catahoula Formation. These soils are on broad flats and footslopes on erosion remnants. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in). 

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, hyperthermic Aridic Calciustolls
