HARCANY SERIES

The Harcany series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of loess and volcanic ash.   Harcany soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.

TAXONOMIC CLASS: Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Pachic Haplocryolls

TYPICAL PEDON:  Harcany gravelly silt loam, rangeland.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)

    A1--0 to 10 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; strong very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (8 to 15 cm)

    A2--10 to 25 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) gravelly silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; moderate very fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 25 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary.  (10 to 20 cm thick)

    A3--25 to 46 cm; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) very gravelly silt loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; massive; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; many very fine interstitial pores; 40 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and stones; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (15 to 25 cm thick)

    2A1--46 to 122 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine and few fine and medium roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 60 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles and stones; neutral (pH 6.8); clear wavy boundary.  (50 to 90 cm thick)

    2A2--122 to 183 cm; brown (10YR 5/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; massive; hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine roots; common very fine interstitial and few very fine tubular pores; 50 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles and stones; neutral (pH 6.8).

COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baconcamp, Badgerton, Badhap, Behanco, Behanin, Belsac, Boydhollow, Bullrey, Busterback, Croesus, Dressel, Gateview, Goodski, Hapgood, Hobacker, Lionhead, Lolon, Marcetta, Mundos, Nagitsy, Namela, Nazaton, Papaspila, Parkcity, Poleline, Povey, Snacreek, Snopoc, Splitbutte and Tonigut series. 

Baconcamp, Belsac, Croesus, Goodski, Nagitsy, Namela, Prong and Splitbutte soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Badgerton, Boydhollow, Bullrey, Busterback, Lolon, Marcetta, Snacreek, and Snopoc have a mollic epipedon less than 86 cm thick. Badhap, Behanco, Behanin, Boydhollow, Dressel, Hapgood, Mundos, Papaspila and Tonigut soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Hobacker soils have visible carbonates and very gravelly loamy sand textures in the series control section.  Lionhead,  Nazaton, Poleline and Povey soils have cambic horizons.  Gateview and Parkcity soils have an udic soil moisture regime. 

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harcany soils are on side slopes of mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from mixed rocks with additions of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 45 to 70 days.

GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Golsum and Spinlin soils.  Both of these soils have clayey-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Golsum soils also have a frigid temperature regime.

DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained; rapid runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.

USE AND VEGETATION:  Livestock grazing and wildlife habitat.  The present vegetation is mainly mountain big sagebrush, snowberry, mountain brome, and Idaho fescue.

DISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  North-central Nevada and southeastern Oregon.  These soils are of moderate extent.  MLRA 23, 24.
